Dialogue||Luckless day! Some flighty fish broke my line and took off with my lucky lure. I made that lure myself back in the day.
Dialogue||Where did you lose it?
Dialogue||Do you need help finding it?
Dialogue||A fish took it! Must have been a real trophy to break my line, too. Probably, the lure washed up on the beach somewhere. Haven't seen it yet, though.
Dialogue||I couldn't ask your help with that. I'm sure you're plenty busy with your farm.
Dialogue||Nonsense, I'll get looking right away!
Dialogue||You're right, I'm way too busy.
Dialogue||Well, if you insist! I'll surely make it worth your time if you return it to me.
Dialogue||I understand. We all have our own sails to trim, after all.
Dialogue||Hey XX, want to lend a hand to our construction effort? We're short on some stone... and funds.
Dialogue||What kind of construction are you doing?
Dialogue||Where can I get stone?
Dialogue||How can I help?
Dialogue||We're finishing up the floor of this event space so we can get more merchants into town.
Dialogue||We just need a little more stone and gold to pay our workers, then we're as good as done!
Dialogue||You can always find stone in the mine. Just head through the quarry and you can't miss it.
Dialogue||We're only 30 stones away from finishing up, but we also need a donation of gold to help pay our masons. Think you can you manage that?
Dialogue||I'm on it!
Dialogue||I'm too busy right now.
Dialogue||Hey now, that's a great attitude!
Dialogue||Too bad, we could really use a hand getting more merchants into town. Let me know if you change your mind.
Dialogue||Hiya XX! Want to help Kitty??
Dialogue||What does Kitty need help with?
Dialogue||What do I need to do?
Dialogue||I'm making a faaaancy dress. It's so so fancy that it even has a gem! Except, I don't have the gem yet, nyan.
Dialogue||Just find me a sapphire for my fancy fancy dress, and I'll pay you gold!
Dialogue||I'll help you!
Dialogue||I can't help you right now.
Dialogue||Oh, good! I can't wait, nya!
Dialogue||So disappointing, nyan...
Dialogue||XX, I was hoping to bump into you. If you have a moment to spare, I could use your help with something.
Dialogue||Why are you asking me?
Dialogue||Where should I go?
Dialogue||I would do it myself, but Liam scheduled a last-minute session with me. I wouldn't ask you if I didn't need to.
Dialogue||After you have the cookies, you can bring them to my office in the library.
Dialogue||Okay, I'll have your cookies in no time.
Dialogue||Sorry, I can't help you right now.
Dialogue||Thanks, XX! You're a lifesaver.
Dialogue||Oh, I understand. Don't worry, I can give the kids pretend cookies.
Dialogue||Hi there, XX. You always seem to have perfect timing - thanks to Pinto's clumsiness, I've got a job for you.
Dialogue||What did Pinto do?
Dialogue||What do you need?
Dialogue||Pinto was sent to gather coal to heat the barracks at night, but he dropped the whole basket into the river on the way back.
Dialogue||I guess there was a bee involved. He seemed embarrassed, so I didn't ask questions.
Dialogue||We'll need 8 pieces of coal to keep us all warm and toasty tonight. Think you can swing it?
Dialogue||I'll get right on it!
Dialogue||Fantastic! You're a real credit to Sun Haven, XX. You can bring the coal to me.
Dialogue||Really? That's too bad. It'll be a chilly night in the barracks.
Dialogue||Oh, XX. Are you headed to the mines? I'm working on a big order and could use your help.
Dialogue||Can't Lynn help?
Dialogue||What do you need me to do?
Dialogue||I have Lynn working on her tempering right now. I'd rather let her focus.
Dialogue||Would you bring me 10 coal? Soon as possible would be best.
Dialogue||I'll get right on that.
Dialogue||Sorry, I can't right now.
Dialogue||Thanks, kid.
Dialogue||Ah well, I'll just have to send Lynn down the mines then.
Dialogue||XX, I have a favor to ask you. I'd like to test a theory I read about. If all goes well, it could end up helping everyone in Sun Haven! Can you lend me a hand?
Dialogue||What's the theory?
Dialogue||I read an article about how bright colors can help raise people's moods subconsciously. Just by being around brighter colors, several test subjects were seen to have improved moods over time.
Dialogue||I'd like you to take these flowers and plant them in specific places all around town. That way, everyone will see them and hopefully get a little happier over time.
Dialogue||I'd love to help test the theory!
Dialogue||I'm too busy to help you.
Dialogue||That's great! Take these four flower plants. Please plant them around town and find me when you're done!
Dialogue||I see. That's okay, I understand. If you happen to find yourself with some free time, come find me.
Dialogue||Hey farmer, how's my breath? Hm, you didn't even flinch. No, this won't work.
Dialogue||What are you talking about?
Dialogue||I'm trying to make my breath smell bad. It's to keep people from talking to me at the tavern. I've been getting a lot of attention lately, so I thought up this genius plan!
Dialogue||Well obviously my breath isn't stinky enough. Can you cook me a meal with fish? <b>Fish Tempura with Fried Noodles</b> should do the trick.
Dialogue||Okay, I'm on it.
Dialogue||Great, get that back to me in a hurry! I'll pay you, of course.
Dialogue||Fine then. Maybe I'll muster up the courage to ask Peter...
Dialogue||Oh, hello there XX. I've heard that you're quite helpful around town. I have a task I could use a hand with, if you have the time.
Dialogue||What kind of a task is it?
Dialogue||Some of the decorative banners around town are looking a tad tattered. I need to repair them to keep Sun Haven looking ship-shape.
Dialogue||If you can bring me some fabric to assist the repairs, that would be greatly appreciated.
Dialogue||I'll do it!
Dialogue||Fantastic! I'll repay you kindly, of course.
Dialogue||Oh dear...
Dialogue||Hey farmer, are you headed by the library?
Dialogue||Why do you ask?
Dialogue||Amanda left her book in my boat last night. I don't really have time to return it today, but I know how much she loves her books.
Dialogue||I was hoping you could return Amanda's book for me. She should be at the library - like always.
Dialogue||I really appreciate it XX. And I know Amanada does, too!
Dialogue||That's too bad, the army pays well.
Dialogue||Hey Mari, XX is here. I bet they can settle this. What do you say, XX, want to settle a bet for us?
Dialogue||Do you two bet against each other often?
Dialogue||What are the stakes?
Dialogue||What's the bet?
Dialogue||Sure, we keep things interesting. Sometimes we disagree, but it's more fun to make a bet out of it!
Dialogue||If you prove me wrong, I'll give you our most expensive meal. On the house!
Dialogue||I say nobody in town is brave enough to go to the forest and slay 5 leaf monsters. Even the guards seem too soft! As usual, Mari thinks I'm wrong.
Dialogue||Sure, I'll prove you wrong!
Dialogue||Maybe next time.
Dialogue||Big talk! But let's see how you feel when you're staring those monsters in the face.
Dialogue||You see? I knew he didn't have it in him.
Dialogue||Excuse me! Do you have time to spare? I've lost something dear to me - a sword from my younger days as a knight.
Dialogue||Do you remember where you had it last?
Dialogue||Sure, sure. Let's see... I went for a walk in the forest... the eastern forest... and brought my sword for protection... a monster jumped out of a bush and scared me, so I ran back to town.
Dialogue||I suppose it must have unclipped from my belt when I ran.
Dialogue||If you could check the eastern forest and find my old sword, I would be very grateful to you.
Dialogue||Oh great, thank you youngster! I'll be waiting for you.
Dialogue||XX! I've heard good things about you. Supposedly you have a variety of skills. I'm hoping one of those skills is combat.
Dialogue||What's going on?
Dialogue||Those blasted monkeys gave me a serious thrashing this morning. They're too dangerous. We need to do something.
Dialogue||Slay some monkeys, and get me their bananas. Hopefully the rest will get the message. Come find me when you're done and I'll gladly pay you.
Dialogue||I'm too busy to help right now.
Dialogue||I can't wait to teach these monkeys a lesson.
Dialogue||That's disappointing. Hopefully someone else will step up to the challenge.
Dialogue||Hey, XX! I need your help, but you have to keep it a secret. You promise you won't tell?
Dialogue||What's up?
Dialogue||Okay, I promise. How can I help?
Dialogue||Sorry, I need you to promise you won't tell or I could get in trouble.
Dialogue||My parents have been telling me I need to be more responsible lately and then I go and lose my notebook! It has all my schoolwork inside. Can you find it for me?
Dialogue||I'll find your notebook, Topi.
Dialogue||Sorry, I can't help right now.
Dialogue||What a relief. You're a lifesaver, XX.
Dialogue||Aw... Dad was right, I am irresponsible. I guess I better start doing my homework, again.
Dialogue||Hey, XX! Can you help me make a necklace?
Dialogue||A necklace?
Dialogue||Mama likes seashells so I want to make a necklace with seashells and fishing string. I already have the string. I found it in the garbage!
Dialogue||I'm not allowed at the beach on my own but I need seashells. Bring me 5 seashells so I can make a really good necklace. I mean, please!
Dialogue||I'm on it, Pod.
Dialogue||I can't wait!
Dialogue||I'll never be able to make a necklace now...
Dialogue||*Yawn* Sorry, did you say something? I'm so bored I almost fell asleep... Hey listen, do me a favor. Bring me a book to read, would you? I can't get caught sleeping on duty again.
Dialogue||Where should I go to get the book?
Dialogue||What kind of book do you want?
Dialogue||If you chop a tree down and make paper out of it, you can write a book from scratch. Or just go to the library, your choice.
Dialogue||I know it's on the other side of town, but try not to get sidetracked.
Dialogue||Something to keep me awake. Maybe something funny? Look for a joke book, if they have one.
Dialogue||Okay, I'll get a book for you.
Dialogue||Thanks, citizen. I'll be here. Like always.
Dialogue||Figures. Hopefully I don't nod off, or I'll be scrubbing the latrine for a week.
Dialogue||People around town say that you're a helpful neighbor. Want to prove it?
Dialogue||Prove it how?
Dialogue||I'm craving fish for dinner, but I won't have time to stop by the store today. Besides, fresh fish is way better than store-bought.
Dialogue||If you catch me a fresh Seabass for dinner, it would really make my day.
Dialogue||I'm too busy to help.
Dialogue||You will? Okay neighbor, come find me when you've made a catch.
Dialogue||Turns out your reputation was just nonsense after all.
Dialogue||It used to be that young folk like you would help us old folk when we needed it. What do you say, are you willing to lend me a hand?
Dialogue||You don't seem to have any trouble getting around.
Dialogue||You don't look that old!
Dialogue||What do you need help with?
Dialogue||I would do it myself, but my knee is acting up again. I try not to show it to keep people from worrying.
Dialogue||Oh, aren't you sweet. Believe me, I feel my age.
Dialogue||The weeds are eating up my yard again. I just need someone to cut them back for me.
Dialogue||No problem, I'll take care of it.
Dialogue||I'm sorry, I can't right now.
Dialogue||It's nice to see that the younger generation still has some respect for their elders.
Dialogue||I guess things really have changed. Nobody has time to help a neighbor anymore.
Dialogue||Welcome, XX. Say, are you busy? If not, do you want to be?
Dialogue||I'm waiting on an order. It's some medicine that Catherine ordered for me, but it's taking longer than expected.
Dialogue||I wondered if you could stop by Catherine's shop to check on my order.
Dialogue||I can do that for you!
Dialogue||Fantastic! I'll be waiting.
Dialogue||Oh, that's too bad.
Dialogue||I'm sorry, were you standing there long? I'm so wrapped up in these late fees that I didn't see you come in.
Dialogue||What late fees?
Dialogue||Do you need help?
Dialogue||We charge people for keeping books past their due date. It's some good extra income, but people don't always pay on time.
Dialogue||Four people owe late fees but none have paid yet and I can't leave to track these people down. It's just a little frustrating.
Dialogue||Not unless you can collect each of these late fees and bring them back here.
Dialogue||Sorry, I can't help with that.
Dialogue||Wow - really? That would be tremendous! Here's the list of people who owe fees. Please come right back when you're finished.
Dialogue||Don't worry, I wasn't expecting you to. I just wish people took more responsibility for their debts.
Dialogue||Rise and shine, XX! I hope you don't mind me waiting here. Hey, it looks like your farm is already shaping up.
Dialogue||Anyway, it's time to plan your first visit to Dragon's Meet. XX, are you ready to meet Elios?
Dialogue||Dragon's Meat?
Dialogue||That's "meet," with two e's. It's where Elios lives on the mountaintop. New neighbors in Sun Haven make the trek to get Elios's blessing as kind of a rite of passage.
Dialogue||The ascent to Dragon's Meet can be dangerous, so I'll escort you up the mountain myself. Just meet me in front of Town Hall tomorrow at 10 am and we'll be on our way.
Dialogue||Sounds like a plan, I'm in!
Dialogue||I'm too busy for this right now.
Dialogue||Perfect! I'll be waiting for you at the Town Hall tomorrow morning.
Dialogue||Oh, I see. In that case, please talk to me as soon as you have some free time. I just can't wait for Elios to give you his blessing!
Dialogue||Hey XX, this is perfect timing! I just realized I forgot to water my garden before coming in today. I'll give you a potion if you help me out.
Dialogue||Where is your garden?
Dialogue||It's just on the side of my house, you know, stuck in the dirt like plants are.
Dialogue||Just make sure all my leafy babies have enough water. I'd be crushed if they withered in the sunshine. Let me know when you've finished so I can repay you.
Dialogue||I'll take care of that.
Dialogue||Great. You're really helping me out, XX.
Dialogue||I guess someone doesn't want a top-quality potion.
Dialogue||Hey, XX! Since you're the only farmer in town, I thought you could help me out.
Dialogue||Why do you need a farmer?
Dialogue||I need someone to grow my Cinaberry plant for me, but nobody has a free plot of dirt. Then I remembered, duh, XX has plenty of free dirt!
Dialogue||The thing is, I have a new kind of fertilizer that I'd like to test. Will you try it out for me? I'll give you the seeds to try it with and everything!
Dialogue||Oh, perfect! I can't wait to see what crops up!
Dialogue||Oh. Well, I understand.
Dialogue||Hey XX, I've got a job for you. I need some meat.
Dialogue||Meat?
Dialogue||Yeah. Doesn't matter what kind of meat. Doesn't even need to be cooked. I'd do it myself, but I just don't have the time.
Dialogue||Bring some meat my way and I'll give you some coin.
Dialogue||I can do that for you.
Dialogue||Great, thanks a lot.
Dialogue||Well then, that's that.
Dialogue||XX! I need your help, please!
Dialogue||What's wrong?
Dialogue||I spilled Liam's big bag of flour on the way home and now he needs to go buy more. I feel so bad!
Dialogue||Can you bring me 5 flour to surprise Liam? If you do, you'll be my favorite!
Dialogue||I'll take care of that for you!
Dialogue||Yay, thank you XX!
Dialogue||Now who will help me?
Dialogue||What happened to my arm? I took a tumble in the mines. My cap fell off my head and the light went out. I got so flustered that I forgot my cap down there! Shame, too. That was my favorite mining cap.
Dialogue||What does it look like?
Dialogue||Sorry to hear about your cap. Maybe you'll find another one like it.
Dialogue||It's green with a light on the front - but I think it's burned out.
Dialogue||Doubtful, that cap was made for me by my grandmother. Nobody makes a cap like Mammy.
Dialogue||I can find your cap for you!
Dialogue||I hope you find your cap.
Dialogue||Well how about that! I'd be remarkably grateful if you did.
Dialogue||Me too.
Dialogue||I prefer to work in the café. The smell of coffee gets my brain working harder!
Dialogue||Hello again. You wouldn't know anything about writing a script, would you?
Dialogue||A script?
Dialogue||Are you always so hard at work?
Dialogue||That's right, for a play. I'm going to be a renowned playwright one day soon.
Dialogue||Hey, you should get an autograph - that'll be worth something after I'm famous!
Dialogue||Until I finish this manuscript, I sure will be. Then again, a script is never really "finished," if you ask me.
Dialogue||You're so sure of yourself!
Dialogue||What if you don't get famous?
Dialogue||Of course! I haven't met anyone that holds up to my skill as a wordsmith. I'm a champion behind the keys of a typewriter.
Dialogue||That seems unlikely... I never really thought about it!
Dialogue||So when do you know you're done with it?
Dialogue||So you just work forever?
Dialogue||I'll know when it's done. That's part of being a writer, you need to have the instincts.
Dialogue||It's never good to rush a script. It will be done when it's done - and it will be <i>glorious!</i>
Dialogue||Darn, I just forgot what I was going to write... oh, it came back to me!
Dialogue||Hi, I'm Jade. You're the new farmer here?
Dialogue||That's right, I'm XX.
Dialogue||XX... Yeah, I like that name! Good to meet you.
Dialogue||I don't want to sound rude, but I'm in the zone right now. Let's talk later?
Dialogue||I'm working hard on a manuscript, but I don't mind a little small talk.
Dialogue||Heather's a good friend. She's mastered the art of small talk, which is perfect for when my writing brain needs a break.
Dialogue||I bet you're a creative type, too.
Dialogue||Farming must have its exciting moments - maybe there's a story there.
Dialogue||Music is my passion, any way you spin it. Heh, that's a little record joke.
Dialogue||Claude comes in so often, I might know him best out of everyone in Sun Haven... just maybe.
Dialogue||Hello, farmer! I hope your crops are, um, growing.
Dialogue||I'm surprised you've stayed open through these hard times.
Dialogue||What made you want to open a record store?
Dialogue||Well, what can I say? I'm careful with my money. It helps that the people of Sun Haven really appreciate their music, too.
Dialogue||Matter of fact, Claude may have single-handedly kept me in business over the years.
Dialogue||I know, it's not the safest bet. I'd probably be better off opening something like...
Dialogue||Aw jeez, I can't even think of another shop to open! That's just it - music is the only thing that I actually know well enough to turn it into a business.
Dialogue||It sounds like you owe Claude big time.
Dialogue||I definitely appreciate music, too!
Dialogue||Yeah, maybe I should thank him somehow. I guess, a record on the house? What do you get somebody who's rich, anyway?
Dialogue||Well great! Grab yourself a jukebox and some records, and you'll be ready to jam out!
Dialogue||Is that what people say now? "Jam out?" I should really know these things.
Dialogue||It's smart to turn your interest into a career.
Dialogue||There's nothing else you're good at?
Dialogue||Hey, thanks! I'm sure that if I tried farming like you, I'd only end up hurting myself. So you bet I'm grateful to be here!
Dialogue||Well... Man, now you put me on the spot and my mind drawing blanks.
Dialogue||I'm not cut out for the kind of work you do. I'm thankful to have this shop.
Dialogue||Have you checked our selection lately? We have some great tunes!
Dialogue||Hello. I don't think we've met - I'm Arvel. Welcome to my music shop.
Dialogue||Hi Arvel, I'm XX.
Dialogue||It's great to meet you. Please, take your time and find something you like.
Dialogue||When talking about the record store, sometimes I say "we," but really it's just me here.
Dialogue||We're hoping for a shipment of new records soon. There's nothing like that new-record-smell.
Dialogue||I bet you wish you were a Slime like me. Slime life!
Dialogue||Oh, you again. Don't you have anyone else to bother? Friends or family?
Dialogue||So who do you usually spend time with around here?
Dialogue||Do you have family here? Or, at all?
Dialogue||The king and prince, obviously. Then Cordelia, since she's on the royal council with me. You know, I don't spend a lot of time with many other people... except you, for some reason.
Dialogue||Why <i>do</i> I bother with you, anyway? Ugh, I'm starting to worry about my sanity.
Dialogue||No, no family here or anywhere that I know of. Before you start up with the pity party - I don't care. I can do whatever I want, whenever I want. So don't throw any feelings my way, okay?
Dialogue||It sounds like you don't have many friends.
Dialogue||I know you like me, even if you won't admit it!
Dialogue||That's about right, and I'm better off for it. I don't need more people wasting my time and filling my head with their dumb thoughts. I get plenty of that from you!
Dialogue||Maybe you're right, maybe I've finally lost it...
Dialogue||Living in this city has softened me up too much - I need to pick a fight with somebody. I'd choose you, but I actually want a challenge.
Dialogue||Pity? You? Please.
Dialogue||It's obvious you miss your mommy.
Dialogue||You're finally starting to sound like you belong here.
Dialogue||I can't tell if you tried for a joke, or if you're just that stupid.
Dialogue||Hey there, outsider. You look lost. The Human town is back where you came from!
Dialogue||So do you have any hobbies - other than antagonizing people, that is?
Dialogue||You know, I think I'm catching onto your act.
Dialogue||Trying to get to know me? I'll play along.
Dialogue||Yeah, I like to challenge my brain since my body is perfect. Chess is my favorite game. Talk about strategy! I'm undefeated in Withergate - and that includes Darius.
Dialogue||Oh, are you now? I'm really, really curious - what is it you think you've caught onto?
Dialogue||Have you beaten the Demon King?
Dialogue||I've never played before.
Dialogue||The Demon King is too busy to play games. Besides, the best strategy against the king is not to play him in the first place - that's a lose-lose.
Dialogue||Well then there's no point in playing against me. Maybe go practice for, oh, fifty years. Start against toddlers and work your way up. I'll be waiting at the top.
Dialogue||You're afraid to act nice because you fear rejection.
Dialogue||You like to push people's buttons to see who breaks and who doesn't.
Dialogue||That... is... HILARIOUS! You took your shot and missed by a mile, pal.
Dialogue||Well look at you, outsider. Of course I like pushing people's buttons - that's what buttons are for!
Dialogue||Heck, I'll admit, I'm surprised with you. The sewer rat has a brain after all!
Dialogue||Sewer rat! Aw, you crawled out of a sewer and into my heart. How gross!
Dialogue||I need capable sailors to join my fleet. Let me know if you see any!
Dialogue||For once, you don't smell like dirt or sewer water! Don't tell me you actually took a bath for me?
Dialogue||I would never bathe for you, Xyla.
Dialogue||Do I really smell different?
Dialogue||Aw, you mean it? That's the sweetest thing I've ever heard!
Dialogue||Never change, XX. I want you just the way you are, body odor and all.
Dialogue||Kind of... wait, that might actually be some food cooking somewhere.
Dialogue||It's too bad you can't smell like pizza all the time. I guess you're not the perfect partner after all...
Dialogue||I could say the same to you, Xyla.
Dialogue||You stink pretty bad too!
Dialogue||Hehe, oh XX... yep, we're a perfect match. It's an undeniable fact at this point. Nobody keeps up with me like you do!
Dialogue||I think you've lost the nuance in your jokes, XX. You're starting to just sound... annoying.
Dialogue||If that's my only problem, I'd say I'm doing pretty well!
Dialogue||I'll try to smell like pizza for you.
Dialogue||Yeah, yeah, don't get a big head. As far as I'm concerned, I can live without the smell of pizza. It woudl just be nice, is all...
Dialogue||And just like that, I swoon!
Dialogue||... I don't actually know what it means to "swoon" but you get the point.
Dialogue||Ugh. Hello again, XX. I'm a bit busy right now, can you try and keep this quick?
Dialogue||Anything I could do to help?
Dialogue||Busier than usual?
Dialogue||Well let's see. Do you either know a team of sewer dredgers who are ready to pull a quadruple shift, or are you willing to put some heavy duty gloves on and do it yourself?
Dialogue||No to both? I thought so.
Dialogue||Nothing gets past you, huh? Darius is alllllways going on about how 'busy' he is, but I'm the one doing all the <i>real</i> work!
Dialogue||Sometimes your job is hard to envy.
Dialogue||You sure do have a lot of stuff to do.
Dialogue||Hate to say I agree, but I agree. Still, I'm Withergate's architect and a member of King Minos's royal council. My job <i>should</i> be hard to envy.
Dialogue||Darius is the prince, you shouldn't criticize him like that.
Dialogue||I think most people know who really does all the heavy lifting.
Dialogue||Oh yes, XX. Thank you for the reminder. Trust me, I didn't need it.
Dialogue||I try looking at it that way, too. In a way, such subtle recognition is its own flavor of reward.
Dialogue||But sometimes I just want a taste of the not-so-subtle recognition, ya know?
Dialogue||There's no reason for us to be friends, far as I can tell. So quit trying!
Dialogue||I love all these animals, but it's more important that they find a real home.
Dialogue||I don't remember seeing you here before. You should go back home.
Dialogue||In a way, Withergate reminds me of the coral reefs in the ocean. So many different people in such a small area!
Dialogue||Aren't you a Mermaid?
Dialogue||Why aren't you in the ocean right now?
Dialogue||What gave it away?
Dialogue||I'm joking! Hehe, I must be the first Mermaid you've ever met. I'm not surprised - we're a very private type of people.
Dialogue||Hehe, I guess you would be curious about that. I ended up here by accident, actually.
Dialogue||I got swept up in an unexpected current and it carried me to this river right here. When I saw where I was - a big city with glittering lights and new people to meet - how could I leave?
Dialogue||So not all mermaids are as friendly as you?
Dialogue||With tails like that, it's no wonder your people stay in the ocean.
Dialogue||Aw, thanks! I suppose I do stand out from the rest of the Mermaids. I've always been interested in strangers, but most Mermaids hide from strangers to protect our people.
Dialogue||Not all of us do. Some Mermaids go on great adventures! I'm evidence of that, aren't I?
Dialogue||So you're just staying here, then?
Dialogue||Don't you miss your home?
Dialogue||Well I'm sure I'll go home sometime, but for now I want to enjoy the city. It's good to have some new experiences, you know?
Dialogue||Plus, there's a prize at the carnival that I've been trying to win for weeks now!
Dialogue||I'm sure my home will still be there when I get back. Our reefs are protected by powerful Elementals. Oh, I wonder if they've been looking for me...
Dialogue||Hey again, outsider! You look boring as ever.
Dialogue||Well, what do you do that's so great?
Dialogue||You look... spiky. Why do you wear so many spikes?
Dialogue||You're kidding, right? I'm the architect - I built this place! Not only that, but I'm on the Demon King's royal council. Learn who you're talking to before throwing out a challenge, outsider.
Dialogue||That's what you've been wondering about me? Sheesh. You really know how to ask the hard-hitting questions. You should be a lawyer or something, really.
Dialogue||Okay, that's... pretty impressive.
Dialogue||So what?
Dialogue||Aw, you're so cute when you defer to your superiors!
Dialogue||You can act unimpressed all you want, but I know it's just an act.
Dialogue||I'm just curious!
Dialogue||Fine, don't tell me.
Dialogue||Listen, spikes look good and hurt people... Remind you of anyone... ?
Dialogue||Hey XX! We're the talk of the town, have you heard?
Dialogue||What do you mean, talk of the town?
Dialogue||So do you still think of me as low-class?
Dialogue||Everyone knows we're together now. I'm a high-profile figure, you know. Don't get too worked up over it, rumors die as quickly as they're born.
Dialogue||Oh, definitely. Come on XX, just because you're dating me doesn't mean you're immediately part of the elite. You have to earn your way to the top!
Dialogue||Who cares? Let them talk.
Dialogue||I don't really like people talking about me.
Dialogue||That's exactly the right attitude. I thought you would never rise above your class, but maybe you have what it takes after all!
Dialogue||Aw, I didn't realize you were such a sensitive little baby! Just let it go, XX.
Dialogue||Maybe I don't want to be part of the "elite."
Dialogue||I'll get there one day!
Dialogue||That's what everyone says until they get their shot, then they always take it. You'd be foolish not to take your shot, XX.
Dialogue||Maybe, if you play your cards right. Anyway, you've surprised me before. I'd bet you have more surprises up your sleeve.
Dialogue||Hey hey! Get a new best friend today!
Dialogue||Don't be shy, any of these little guys would love to meet you!
Dialogue||You really try hard to sell pets.
Dialogue||How do you know the pets are going to good homes?
Dialogue||Of course I do. It isn't about making a quick ticket or anything, I truly want all of these critters to find a good home. Thankfully most everyone in town is crazy for them!
Dialogue||Everyone here is good people, so I'd trust anyone in the city, so long as they're a citizen. Say, you <i>are</i> a citizen, aren't you?
Dialogue||Why not give the pets away for free, then?
Dialogue||You're very dedicated to these pets.
Dialogue||Well, if I don't make any tickets, then I don't earn a living. If I don't earn a living, then I have to close the shop. If I close the shop, where will you get your new best friend?
Dialogue||Think, XX!
Dialogue||Hey, thanks! I love a customer's compliments - makes me feel like I'm doing something right. Hey, you <i>are</i> a customer, right?
Dialogue||You're way too trusting.
Dialogue||You must know your customers well.
Dialogue||Nah, you just don't know what you're talking about. I know practically everyone in Withergate, so I know who I'm selling to.
Dialogue||Hey, I'm the guy who sells all the cute little animals! I've gotten to know practically everyone in town, so I know who I'm selling to.
Dialogue||Can you feel this city's energy? It's electrifying!
Dialogue||If I keep seeing you around like this, I'm going to have to hide out in the carnival.
Dialogue||Is that your favorite thing about Withergate - the carnival?
Dialogue||So was the carnival your idea?
Dialogue||Well, the carnival is great, but really the best thing about Withergate is my position here.
Dialogue||The people here respect me, fear me, and desire me all at once. What more could I want?
Dialogue||What do you think? Of course, that carnival is my baby! I didn't want to live in some boring city with no nightlife, so I pitched the idea.
Dialogue||Thankfully the Demon King appreciates fun as much as I do. Now I have a great place to hang out and bragging rights to boot.
Dialogue||Why would you want to be feared?
Dialogue||What - um - makes you think I desire you?
Dialogue||Asked like a true commoner. Take notes, sewer rat: fear is power and power is freedom.
Dialogue||When you ask why I want to be feared, what you're really asking is, "Why do you want to be free?"
Dialogue||Oh come on, sewer rat. You really think I haven't noticed you glancing up and down? Like I told you some time ago, we keep our eyes and ears open around here.
Dialogue||So you made it just so you wouldn't be bored here?
Dialogue||I've seen the carnival - it really is fun!
Dialogue||Of course. Oh, what have they got in Sun Haven again? A library? And you're telling me you don't get bored over there? Yeah, right.
Dialogue||Just admit that we monsters know how to have more fun than those humans. Come on, I know you're thinking it!
Dialogue||You're darn right it is. What better way is there to bring people together than a carnival? You'll see, the success of Withergate will boil down to games and neon lights, with me to thank.
Dialogue||What are you looking at? ... Jeez, your eyes are gorgeous.
Dialogue||If you're going to spend so much time here, you might as well help out. Most of our citizens contribute somehow, you know.
Dialogue||Is that where all of this technology came from?
Dialogue||Hey, I'm a very helpful person.
Dialogue||I'd love to take credit for all our awesome lights, but that's the one part of Withergate I had nothing to do with.
Dialogue||The people actually brought all this technology with them from... wherever they came from. The takeaway is, even our lowest citizens have more to offer than your Human town!
Dialogue||Maybe, or maybe you're just in it for the pay.
Dialogue||Actually, that reminds me. I have something for you. Don't read into it too much, but it's a gift.
Dialogue||You still had something to do with it, you know.
Dialogue||You shouldn't call them your "lowest citizens."
Dialogue||Hm, yeah I guess you're right. They wouldn't even be here if not for me. Good point, farmer!
Dialogue||If that actually bothers you, then you have no sense of class. It's called hierarchy, and you're at the bottom.
Dialogue||Wait, you have a gift for me?
Dialogue||You've never surprised me like this before!
Dialogue||Yeah yeah, don't make a big thing about it. I figure since we're starting to be... friends and all...
Dialogue||Anyway, just take this. It's a chess piece, the black queen. I swiped it from the Demon King's chess set when we were remodeling the throne room.
Dialogue||I thought it would remind you of me. Also, I don't want to get blamed for the stolen piece. You're welcome!
Dialogue||What are you looking at, sewer rat?
Dialogue||You just can't stay away, can you XX?
Dialogue||I could stay away, but I'd rather go on another date with you.
Dialogue||You don't like the attention?
Dialogue||Stepping up to bat again! I'm impressed with you, XX. I figured the first time you asked, you had just bumped your head or something!
Dialogue||I love attention, that will never change. But to say that I love YOUR attention is a bit of a stretch, don't you think?
Dialogue||Now that I think about it, this is a mistake.
Dialogue||Come on, it will be fun!
Dialogue||Whatever floats your boat, sewer rat. You would have just bored me, anyway.
Dialogue||We <i>did</i> have fun last time, so let's give it another go! Meet me in front of my apartment at 5:00 pm tomorrow.
Dialogue||I don't know - I think I've got a shot!
Dialogue||I don't care what you think of me.
Dialogue||Oh no, you've gone completely delusional. I would call you a doctor if I only cared at all.
Dialogue||Hah! It's painfully obvious that you care what I think of you. Has anyone ever told you that you're a terrible liar?
Dialogue||Hey hey! I haven't seen you around here before, but what does that matter? No matter who you are, everyone needs a companion in life!
Dialogue||My name is XX, it's good to meet you.
Dialogue||Pleased to meet you, XX. I'm Cayde, and welcome to my pet store!
Dialogue||We've got everything you need for your new friend whether they're furry, feathered, scaly, slimy, or the otherwise! Care to look around? They'd love to meet you!
Dialogue||You got a thought bouncing around up there? Or did you just forget how to blink?
Dialogue||I was just looking at the trees. Why are all the trees around here dead, anyway?
Dialogue||Have you been busy around here?
Dialogue||Sorry XX, there are some things you'll have to ask the king himself. That question is one of them.
Dialogue||Not too busy. Withergate basically runs itself these days. Sure, I still sit on the council, but it's not nearly as busy as when I oversaw the city's construction.
Dialogue||Back then, I felt like a real boss! Now I just help the king with boring jobs.
Dialogue||Why?
Dialogue||So you don't know the answer either.
Dialogue||I'm just not authorized to talk about it. I don't usually follow other people's rules, but King Minos is just about the only person in this town I defer to. So go ask the king if you want to know.
Dialogue||You should feel honored to work with the king.
Dialogue||If you're bored, I guess that means you're good at your job.
Dialogue||Have you been talking to Darius? That sounded just like one of his lines. Which I don't buy for a second, by the way.
Dialogue||Hm, good point. I suppose there are worse things than that. Thanks XX, that was actually helpful.
Dialogue||Withergate is a big place. Do you really want to travel it all alone?
Dialogue||Can you really walk out alone??
Dialogue||I've lived in Withergate all my life. That's right, seven long years!
Dialogue||You know I still think of you as a sewer rat, right?
Dialogue||Withergate is the perfect place to practice reading the stars.
Dialogue||Have you been spending more time up at that ridiculous rooftop garden? I'll never understand why!
Dialogue||What's wrong with the rooftop garden?
Dialogue||Doesn't anyone else in the city farm?
Dialogue||Look around you! Withergate has everything it needs. I designed the city, don't you remember?
Dialogue||I included that rooftop garden as a technicality, in case someone around here ever decided to actually start some farming. I never expected anyont to actually <i>use</i> it!
Dialogue||Not anyone in the city, no. Why would they need to? Withergate has everything anyone could want, ever. I designed it that way.
Dialogue||A bit shortsighted of you.
Dialogue||Lucky you thought to include one, though.
Dialogue||That's real big talk for someone who spends all day digging through dirt on a rooftop!
Dialogue||Well, of course I thought to include one. It's just like I said, though, I never expected anyone would ever use it. But I guess even I can't always predict my own genius!
Dialogue||It has everything except a real farm.
Dialogue||Fair enough.
Dialogue||Are we going to pretend the rooftop farm isn't a real farm? Just because it takes up an otherwise perfectly good rooftop doesn't make it a fake farm or something!
Dialogue||Right? Thanks for seeing it my way. Now run back to your little rooftop farm, farmer.
Dialogue||Because surely you're wondering - yes, I am <i>that</i> Eris Umbra.
Dialogue||I've never heard of you before
Dialogue||What's a pirate like yourself doing in a city like this?
Dialogue||Say again? Never, not even once? My reputation must be slipping... which is a good thing, I suppose.
Dialogue||All you need to know about me is that I'm the richest pirate at sea. And since riches are the key to freedom, you could say I'm the most free pirate, too!
Dialogue||I've been hiding out here for nearly a month now, trying to keep a low profile.
Dialogue||It seems like it's been working so far. I haven't met a single person who knew my name! It's a little insulting, actually.
Dialogue||It sounds nice to sail free across the sea.
Dialogue||But you're not at sea.
Dialogue||It's the best feeling in the world, let me tell you. It will be even better when I have my own fleet behind me... one day.
Dialogue||Har har, you know what I mean. I'm no stickler for wordplay.
Dialogue||Are you in some kind of danger?
Dialogue||I only need to remain hidden. Four years ago, I abandoned my role as a noble in a far-off region. In fact, I was the queen's chief advisor until rebels stormed the castle.
Dialogue||Queen Mayaria let herself get caught so that I could escape. In my heart, I am still loyal to her.
Dialogue||I need to remain hidden because I abandoned my role as a noble in a far-off region. That was four years ago. In fact, I was the queen's chief advisor until rebels stormed the castle.
Dialogue||Isn't there something else you need to do right now?
Dialogue||There are some nice beaches by that Human town, Sun Haven. The sand is so soft!
Dialogue||There's no place in the world I wouldn't set anchor and explore.
Dialogue||You're so small.
Dialogue||It took me a long time to earn a reputation as a tough Demon here. I don't need you messing that up!
Dialogue||So you seem to be pretty good at earning tickets. Don't get an ego, you're just a bit less lazy than the average Withergate citizen!
Dialogue||Why does Withergate use tickets, anyways?
Dialogue||I worked hard for my tickets.
Dialogue||They're wonderful, right? So much easier to use than those gaudy gold coins the Humans love so much. Plus, they're perfect for our carnival!
Dialogue||Needless to say, I was the one who pitched the ticket idea to King Minos. I truly am the best!
Dialogue||Yeah, yeah. I'm sure you're very proud of all your 'hard' work, farmer. Do you have any idea how hard I work?
Dialogue||One day in my shoes, and you'd be begging for your little farm back!
Dialogue||Paper money is a very novel idea.
Dialogue||Your idea seems to work for Withergate.
Dialogue||Looks like you're finally starting to get it. Sometimes you gotta think outside of the box to solve a problem, and no one does that better than me!
Dialogue||I work way harder than you.
Dialogue||Well you wouldn't last one <i>hour</i> on a farm.
Dialogue||Oh yeah? Name the first three things I do when I wake up every morning. What's that? You don't know what they are? Typical. Keep walking, outsider!
Dialogue||Ohh, big talk is my favorite kinda talk, XX. You aren't half-bad, for a stinky outsider.
Dialogue||My tail is getting dry...
Dialogue||I love the carnival, but sometimes it feels like these carnival games are rigged... Really, I should win by default.
Dialogue||Why should you win?
Dialogue||Hey, the carnival was your doing.
Dialogue||Because it's <i>my</i> carnival! Without me, there wouldn't be any prizes to win in the first place. And now I can't even win one.
Dialogue||Well forget it, I don't need any of those dumb plushies anyway.
Dialogue||Exactly! That's why it's so stupid that I can't win the darn games. I've seen Donovan walk out of rthe carnival grounds with his arms full of toys. What's he doing that I'm not??
Dialogue||Just be better at the games!
Dialogue||I'll win one for you.
Dialogue||Heh, of course! It's so simple!
Dialogue||Thanks for showing me the light, XX. I don't know what I'd do without the advice of a sewer rat like you.
Dialogue||Ugh, that's all I need. A farmer making me look bad at my own carnival.
Dialogue||Maybe he's just better than you at carnival games.
Dialogue||Maybe he's cheating.
Dialogue||Hmph. I don't have time to practice these games all day. It must be nice, not working a steady job. I really don't know how that fleabag survives here.
Dialogue||Maybe... nah, that doesn't seem like his style. I don't know him too well but he doesn't seem dishonest to me.
Dialogue||If you spot an X on the ground, just ignore it!
Dialogue||Hey, XX. Can I grab you for a moment? I need the opinion of someone like you.
Dialogue||I can't believe you actually want my help with something.
Dialogue||What's so surprising about that, huh? You came to Withergate as an outsider, and I'm not so ignorant to believe that you don't have a unique perspective because of that.
Dialogue||Sometimes unique perspective is what I need, got it?
Dialogue||Darius wishes for Withergate to be entirely self-sufficient, no need for outsiders immigrating into the city.
Dialogue||But here you are, an outsider making it in Withergate. I can't help but think what we could do to attract more outsiders and all the talent they could bring.
Dialogue||I guess I never considered that.
Dialogue||That makes sense to me.
Dialogue||Don't sweat it. That's the great thing about me: I think of all the things you don't.
Dialogue||See? You're a bright young farmer. You get up to speed quick.
Dialogue||I don't think many people would want to move to Withergate.
Dialogue||Making it easier to get into the city would be a start.
Dialogue||I didn't ask if you thought anyone would move here or not. But if you aren't going to entertain my thoughts, then just forget it, okay?
Dialogue||I know, I know. That's a great point, but "we have to protect our borders", according to the prince.
Dialogue||It was no small task to get into Withergate from the outside, XX. But maybe that's a good filter. Only the really ambitious sewer rats, like you, can enter the city!
Dialogue||One day, I'lll have to visit Sun Haven - just to freak everyone out!
Dialogue||I like the ring you gave me, but it could use a couple of spikes.
Dialogue||Sitting on the royal council is mostly just dealing with citizens. And mostly, it's dumb citizens.
Dialogue||If anyone asks, you're a gladiator instead of a farmer. Got it? It's less embarrassing for me.
Dialogue||I'd love to organize a Withergate chess tournament, but something else always seems to get in the way.
Dialogue||You want to organize a chess tournament?
Dialogue||What's stopping you from organizing a chess tournament?
Dialogue||Of course. You remember I'm something of a monster at chess, don't you? I'd love to put my skills on display in a grand city-wide tournament, to show everyone who's boss.
Dialogue||Where do I begin! I'm backlogged out for the next two-hundred and eighty years.
Dialogue||Mostly on urban expansion, though Darius constantly mentions wanting to add another seven wings onto Withergate Castle.
Dialogue||A chess tournament would be great for Withergate.
Dialogue||No one in Withergate would bother with a chess tournament.
Dialogue||Glad you agree, XX. I love all the other attractions Withergate has to offer, but I feel the city has always lacked something to really challenge the mind.
Dialogue||I'll make it happen, one of these days.
Dialogue||Look at you, speaking so frank. Hey, guess what? I'm the one with all the public statistics and data! Remember that no one wants to hear your uninformed thoughts.
Dialogue||Especially me.
Dialogue||Darius wants seven wings added to the castle?
Dialogue||Can't you just work harder?
Dialogue||He has this big, dramatic vision of seven spires topping the castle. It's so grand and ridiculous, so naturally I absolutely love the idea.
Dialogue||But it'll add another thirty years of work, at least. Curse Darius and his impeccable taste in excessive architecture!
Dialogue||Gee, wow. Never thought about "just work harder", brilliant thinking, XX. I'm making fun of your stupid idea, of course.
Dialogue||Well if it isn't my beloved sewer rat.
Dialogue||Oh, I'm sorry. Did you want me to stop calling you that? Never going to happen!
Dialogue||Maybe it's time I came up with a nickname for you.
Dialogue||You know, I don't even mind it anymore.
Dialogue||But you've been on my good side for so long. Do you really want to throw that all away, XX?
Dialogue||Hah, sure you don't! I can see your face twitch whenever I say it, XX. I keep my eyes open, remember?
Dialogue||Hm...
Dialogue||I can always get back on your good side.
Dialogue||Don't tell me you're actually considering!
Dialogue||Oh, of course you're joking. I can't believe I thought you were serious for a moment!
Dialogue||Big talk! But you better have a real good plan to win me back XX - I won't make it so easy the second time!
Dialogue||I don't know how you stay so attentive all the time.
Dialogue||If you're still on guard around me, then you need to relax.
Dialogue||Maybe I'm just attentive when it comes to you! Heh, I guess you'll never know.
Dialogue||It's not like that, it's more of an affectionate attention. But if you want me to stop, then maybe I'll just pay less attention to you.
Dialogue||You know, in the right light you don't look half bad, XX!
Dialogue||Hold on, I think that's the first time you've ever used my real name!
Dialogue||That was barely a compliment, by the way.
Dialogue||Don't worry, you'll always be a sewer rat to me.
Dialogue||That's about as good as my compliments get. But maybe I'm just lacking a good example. Go ahead farmer, lay one on me.
Dialogue||Well I wouldn't want you to like me too much.
Dialogue||And you'll always be a bully!
Dialogue||Don't get ahead of yourself. One little date doesn't make us best friends.
Dialogue||Aw, you do know me! How sweet of you, XX.
Dialogue||Your breath is tolerable today.
Dialogue||Your strength is rivalled only by your beauty.
Dialogue||Aw, you mean it? That's the nicest thing anyone has ever said to me! Thanks XX, you really know how to treat a girl right.
Dialogue||... I don't know what I was prepared for, but it was not that. I think I'm sick to my stomach.
Dialogue||You came here through the sewer? Yuck! Why not just use the river?
Dialogue||Darius and Cordelia are both behind on their work for King Minos... Once again, Xyla picks up the slack.
Dialogue||Hoy! My name's Eris Umbra. What do you call yourself?
Dialogue||My name is XX.
Dialogue||XX, I have to tell you something - you smell worse than a barrel of fish left in the sun. Did you think it a good idea, coming in through the sewer?
Dialogue||Look here, it's the Withergate Wannabe! You just can't stay away can you?
Dialogue||Do you have any plans for Withergate?
Dialogue||So you like it in Withergate?
Dialogue||One word: expansion. I've clearly done a bang-up job with the space we have here, but I want to see Withergate become a real metropolis!
Dialogue||If I didn't, don't you think I'd leave? Of course I like it here! In a city of dimwitted monsters and demons, a person like me can have a lot of fun.
Dialogue||That seems a little idealistic.
Dialogue||A monster metropolis, huh? If anyone can do it, it would be you.
Dialogue||Idealistic is thinking you can snap off little comments like that without getting called out. Seriously outsider, who do you think you're talking to?
Dialogue||You've got an eye for aptitude. You're sharper than you look, outsider.
Dialogue||That sounds a little mean.
Dialogue||You definitely have confidence going for you.
Dialogue||No need to get your feelings hurt, outsider. I'm not trying to hurt your feelings or anything. If I was, you would know it.
Dialogue||Take it from me, confidence will take you places in this town. Flattery, on the other hand, will not... Unless you catch me on a good day.
Dialogue||What are you looking at me for?
Dialogue||One day I'll come out of hiding and return Queen Mayaria to her rightful throne.
Dialogue||Don't try me, outsider, or I'll show you what these horns can do.
Dialogue||Huh? Who are you?
Dialogue||My name's XX.
Dialogue||XX? Dumb name. Mine's Slobert.
Dialogue||There's my farmer! So how much of your farm belongs to me now that we're married?
Dialogue||Um... none of it?
Dialogue||Did you ever see this in your future?
Dialogue||What? Booo. I thought that married people had to share everything they own!
Dialogue||What, falling for the romantic wiles of the Human Town's only farmer? Of course XX, this was always the plan.
Dialogue||You don't need a wedding to get what you want, Xyla.
Dialogue||Then do I own half of all your stuff?
Dialogue||Hey, good point! I always was a "take now, avoid questions later" kind of person.
Dialogue||Huh? No way!
Dialogue||I worked way too hard to get robbed by some bozo with a ring.
Dialogue||Ha ha, your sarcasm is so funny.
Dialogue||Okay, I guess this is a bit of a surprise for us both.
Dialogue||I think so, too! I'm glad we share this completely genuine, mutual appreciation for my humor.
Dialogue||You mean you didn't plan on gretting romantically involved with the Demon King Minos's right hand on the royal council? Or did you just not expect to fall in love with a Demon?
Dialogue||Either way, don't act like I'm not the most exciting thing that's ever happened to you!
Dialogue||Sometimes I remember that you had just crawled out of a sewer when we met. Then I think, "I can't believe I'm with this sewer rat!"
Dialogue||Are you finally having second thoughts?
Dialogue||Are you happy with our relationship?
Dialogue||Eh, no such luck... It's not everyday I find someone who can keep up with me like you do, XX. That's worth something, even if it came from the sewer!
Dialogue||Ugh, you know I hate getting into mushy talk. But since you asked...
Dialogue||There's a <i>teeny tiny</i> chance that I'm happier than ever before... just a chance!
Dialogue||I've even been thinking that I wouldn't mind staying this happy for the rest of my life, you know. Do you catch my drift, XX? Or is that too subtle for your little rat brain?
Dialogue||It's not my fault there's no good road to Withergate...
Dialogue||You throw that in my face a lot for someone who used to live in a cave.
Dialogue||Are you saying that it's my fault? Well... actually, you're technically right about that. Heck, maybe Withergate could use a reliable road. I'll bring it up to King Minos.
Dialogue||I would choose a cave over a sewer any day. If you disagree, then you're either a sewer rat or... well, Donovan.
Dialogue||Oh, I sure do.
Dialogue||Oh, I sure do... not.
Dialogue||You'd better! My ring finger is feeling pretty light these days.
Dialogue||I would sigh, but the breath would be wasted on you... Let's just say that my ring finger is feeling pretty light these days. Get the picture now?
Dialogue||Welcome back, outsider. I guess you're sticking around, huh?
Dialogue||I guess I can't blame you. This city is just too great.
Dialogue||Hey, where did you live before Withergate?
Dialogue||Hey, if you could live anywhere in the world, where would you go?
Dialogue||Before Withergate City was built, there was only the castle. The Demon King took me in after Darius found me living in a cave out in the wilds.
Dialogue||I didn't really have a home before that and I've got to say... I kind of miss it!
Dialogue||Anywhere, huh? I've heard that the Naga have some real intricate cave systems that include whole cities. I don't know why, but there's just something so comfy about a dark, dripping cave.
Dialogue||So you owe it all to Darius, huh?
Dialogue||Living in a cave is pretty hardcore.
Dialogue||I don't owe anything to anyone, outsider. Darius has my respect and loyalty - even my friendship! - but he doesn't own me.
Dialogue||For once I agree with you! But it flooded when it rained, so I decided to follow Darius back to the castle anyway. Eh, it worked out all right.
Dialogue||A cave sounds awful.
Dialogue||I guess I can see why you'd be comfortable there.
Dialogue||Hey, you asked me the question. What did you expect - a tropical beach? That's not my style.
Dialogue||Caves are safe and private. Honestly, I don't know why more people aren't living in caves!
Dialogue||I haven't seen you here before. Of course, I usually have my eyes on the water.
Dialogue||You have a kind face. I'm Honey, nice to meet you!
Dialogue||Hello Honey, my name is XX.
Dialogue||It's my pleasure to meet you, XX. I'll see you around town for sure!
Dialogue||Did you know that your face is way too easy to make fun of? I thought you should hear it from someone who loves you!
Dialogue||I can really move when I'm underwater! On land, not so much.
Dialogue||Now that we're married, my reputation here is basically ruined.
Dialogue||You again? What, are you bored of Sun Haven?
Dialogue||Oh, you actually want to talk. This should be good!
Dialogue||Wait, how do you know I'm from Sun Haven?
Dialogue||Who even are you?
Dialogue||Unlike your Human town, we keep our eyes and ears open around here. You should take a page out of our book and get some real security.
Dialogue||I'm Xyla, and that's the only time I'll tell you my name so don't bother asking again. I'm surprised a sewer rat like you made it to Withergate on your own.
Dialogue||Have you been spying on Sun Haven?
Dialogue||Sun Haven has security...
Dialogue||Well <i>I</i> haven't been spying...
Dialogue||Don't get so worked up, it's barely spying. Besides, it's just a precaution. You do know what precaution is, don't you?
Dialogue||Those guards may as well be sleep walking. Matter of fact, I've actually seen one sleeping on duty before! If you ask me, your Human armies are just adorable.
Dialogue||That's not very nice.
Dialogue||I'm surprised a rude monster like you has any place in this town.
Dialogue||Oops, didn't mean to hurt your feelings, sewer rat. Don't go springing a leak now.
Dialogue||Oh, you've got teeth? That's good, I like that! Sometimes you have to bite to get by in these parts.
Dialogue||Don't start hanging around me all the time just because we're dating. I still have an image to maintain.
Dialogue||I don't have a lot of close friends in Withergate. Most people scare too easily.
Dialogue||The open ocean is exhilarating... but dangerous.
Dialogue||What's the Human town like, anyway? Boring, right? Yeah, I figured.
Dialogue||You know, I think it's ridiculous that you got the apartment right next to mine.
Dialogue||Why is that ridiculous?
Dialogue||I didn't ask for that exact apartment.
Dialogue||Because the top floor is <i>supposed</i> to be for high-profile tenants only. I'm part of the royal council, so it makes sense that I'm there.
Dialogue||But you? You were just the only person looking for a room!
Dialogue||Sure, sure, pass the blame. Classy move. You better stay nice and quiet, got it? I don't need any trouble from next door.
Dialogue||So go complain about it.
Dialogue||Feel free to sleep on the roof, then!
Dialogue||You need to check your attitude, sewer rat. Besides, Flemmett doesn't take complaints.
Dialogue||Oh, I see how it is! You think you've earned that apartment, huh? Well then I vow to be the <i>worst</i> next door neighbor possible. Just for you!
Dialogue||I won't give you any trouble.
Dialogue||Well now I kind of want to give you some trouble...
Dialogue||Good! Because I don't respond well to annoying neighbors. Why do you think your apartment was empty in the first place?
Dialogue||Trust me XX, that's not what you want. I don't respond well to annoying neighbors. Why do you think your apartment was empty in the first place?
Dialogue||Nobody in this town takes my punches like you, XX!
Dialogue||Looking for a life partner? I can help - with a pet!
Dialogue||I'm glad it's so dark here. Otherwise, I might dry up.
Dialogue||You look like a real animal lover! I'm right, aren't I?
Dialogue||... You're looking at me funny. But not in a way that makes me want to laugh.
Dialogue||Okay, you're creeping me out. What's the big idea?
Dialogue||Xyla, you're not dating anybody, right?
Dialogue||Here's the thing, Xyla... Let's go out.
Dialogue||Wow, strong assumption, outsider. Are you trying to leave town bruised?
Dialogue||If I'm not dating anyone, it's just because there's nobody in this town worth my time.
Dialogue||Go... Date?? Wow, sewer rat! I never thought you'd be brave enough to ask me.
Dialogue||Really? But there are so many people in Withergate.
Dialogue||Yeah, most people here are far below you.
Dialogue||And here I was just starting to think you were fun to talk to. No surprise you went and ruined it, sewer rat.
Dialogue||Ugh... flattery. I hate that I love it.
Dialogue||On second thought, this was a mistake.
Dialogue||Maybe there's more to me than you know!
Dialogue||Chickening out after you asked? I'm not surprised. You would just bore me anyway.
Dialogue||Okay then, why not? Let's see what happens. If nothing else, it could be hilarious! Meet me in front of my apartment at 5:00 pm tomorrow.
Dialogue||Phew, you stink!
Dialogue||Wait, you said I stink? Are you serious?
Dialogue||So, what... are you?
Dialogue||Yeah! You smell, like grass and salt. It's disgusting!
Dialogue||What kind of question is that? I'm a Slime! You expect me to believe you've never seen a Slime before??
Dialogue||I can't believe <i>you</i> think <i>I'm</i> disgusting.
Dialogue||It's too bad I don't smell like you...
Dialogue||What's that supposed to mean? You trying to be funny??
Dialogue||You can! You want some slime? Cover up that stink? Let me know!
Dialogue||I've never seen a Slime.
Dialogue||Where would I have seen a Slime?
Dialogue||You mean I have to be your first Slime? So uncultured, so uneducated... It's too bad you couldn't meet a nice Slime first. Like my wife!
Dialogue||We mostly live in garbage dumps. But I moved to the big city for work! I have to support my Slime family!
Dialogue||If you keep staring at me, I'm going to remove your ability to stare at anything.
Dialogue||Remind me, your name is XX? I don't mean to be rude, I just have a lot on my mind.
Dialogue||Do you have a question for me?
Dialogue||What do you do here?
Dialogue||Have you received a blessing from Nivara?
Dialogue||I'm an enchantress, so I use magic to make life easier. At least, that's the idea... Heh, sometimes my experiments have unexpected results.
Dialogue||Oh, yes, so very fascinating. Talk about power, I can't even begin to understand the magic she wields. But that's expected of a dragon's power, I guess.
Dialogue||What made you want to be an enchantress?
Dialogue||How does your magic make life easier?
Dialogue||Oh my, that's a big question. I guess nature and magic are just such huge bodies of knowledge, so the chance to combine the two... who could pass that up??
Dialogue||Mainly by helping the ecosystem - keeping plants alive year-round, making trees grow from rocks, that sort of thing.
Dialogue||Not to mention, my favorite berries are always in season now!
Dialogue||Maybe you should study her.
Dialogue||I'm sure your magic is powerful, too.
Dialogue||There are certain lines that even researchers shouldn't cross. As an ethical enchantress, I refuse to do research on Nivara. Her magic isn't for us.
Dialogue||Oh, thanks! My enchantments aren't exactly on par with Nivara's, but they get the job done.
Dialogue||I've been wondering lately, what is life outside of Nel'Vari like? In the lands and cities beyond.
Dialogue||What has you wondering about the world outside Nel'Vari?
Dialogue||It varies widely, depending on where you go.
Dialogue||I've lived in Nel'Vari for a very long time. I know how everything works here. How the people go about their days, and the powers that make our society tick.
Dialogue||I might be an Enchanter, but I've given everything around here at least a cursory try before.
Dialogue||But what's it like outside of Nel'Vari? What sort of fundamental power turns the wheels in places like Sun Haven?
Dialogue||The power of Enchanting has so deeply altered how we are able to live and work in Nel'Vari, it's strange but fun to sometimes imagine how we'd get by without it.
Dialogue||I would never want to leave Nel'Vari, but it does makes me wonder... Would I still be the same Iris if I were born in Sun Haven?
Dialogue||I'd love to tell you all about it sometime.
Dialogue||Go out and see for yourself sometime!
Dialogue||It would be incredibly interesting to hear. Thank you for understanding my curiosity, and thank you even more for offering to sate it.
Dialogue||No thanks, XX. You should I know prefer to stay relatively close to Nel'Vari. I just wanted to ask you a question, I didn't expect you to try pushing me like this.
Dialogue||You would always be you, no matter what.
Dialogue||If you weren't born in Nel'Vari you'd be a totally different person.
Dialogue||Hmm, you really believe so? That's also an interesting thought! Iris the Human, experimenting on... cows, or... rocks. Or whatever it is they use over there.
Dialogue||That's such a tough thing to think, even if you might be right. I don't <i>want</i> to ever be different. I want to be Iris! Maybe I should stop thinking about the outside world.
Dialogue||Have you heard any good records lately? I love having music in the background.
Dialogue||How have you been, XX? I hope you're not working too hard.
Dialogue||What's wrong with working hard?
Dialogue||How's your work been lately?
Dialogue||Oh, nothing at all! But if you're working <i>too</i> hard, then you should take a break. No matter what you're doing, you should never overwork yourself.
Dialogue||Slower than usual, actually. But that's quite alright. We're living comfortably and I enjoy the free time I have.
Dialogue||Pod likes it when I'm available for playtime, too!
Dialogue||I'll try to remember that.
Dialogue||Don't worry about my job.
Dialogue||Just keep it in mind when you're out on the farm, alright, XX?
Dialogue||I'll always worry when my neighbors aren't taking care of themselves.
Dialogue||At least you're not starving.
Dialogue||You should write a book.
Dialogue||Oh, that's the least of my worries. If things ever got that dire, of course we'd be taken care of by our wonderful community.
Dialogue||I know you wouldn't let us starve, XX!
Dialogue||As a matter of fact, I have tried before. I found it difficult, though, and haven't finished it. Maybe one day I will, but in the meantime writing inspiring speeches is much easier!
Dialogue||Liam is my brother!
Dialogue||Nobody knows their way around a griddle like my Ronald.
Dialogue||You've been here a while now. Do you like Nel'Vari, XX?
Dialogue||Sometimes I wish it was different, but I'm not sure how.
Dialogue||If you could live somewhere else, where would you want to live?
Dialogue||Life in Nel'Vari seems so peaceful, but do you ever get bored?
Dialogue||I've heard that the Southern Islands are lush with exotic plants, which sounds amazing. I don't think I'd leave Nel'Vari for it, but it's a fun thought.
Dialogue||Personally, I don't get bored. I keep busy with enchanting and the occasional woodworking.
Dialogue||I know Vaan gets bored though. That guy spends more time outside of Nel'Vari than inside, it seems like.
Dialogue||What WOULD you leave Nel'Vari for?
Dialogue||What would you do if you lived there?
Dialogue||I'm not quite sure. There's never been a reason to leave, so I haven't.
Dialogue||I guess I just need a good reason. But it would have to be a really good one!
Dialogue||More of the same, probably. Enchanting, experimenting, some woodwork. Ooh, I bet my experiments would look completely different!
Dialogue||You're incredibly devoted to your profession, Iris.
Dialogue||You should be more like Vaan.
Dialogue||What's that Human saying? "Practice makes it perfect?" Something like that.
Dialogue||Anyway, I'm proud of my skills so practicing a lot keeps me happy.
Dialogue||Hm, I don't think so. He spends a lot of time around other people. I need more time to myself.
Dialogue||You're looking stronger and stronger every time I see you, XX. I guess that's because of your farm work, huh?
Dialogue||I hope you get to see my farm one day.
Dialogue||I'd really like to go out with you again, Iris.
Dialogue||I would like that, XX. It will just take a little time, is all. I hope you'll be patient with me.
Dialogue||I was just thinking, it's about time for our second date.
Dialogue||Sometimes you just need to take a chance.
Dialogue||Take all the time you need, Iris.
Dialogue||Sometimes... maybe. But this doesn't feel like one of those times.
Dialogue||Thanks, XX. I knew I could count on you.
Dialogue||Perfect!
Dialogue||Actually, I'll have to pass on this one.
Dialogue||Let's meet at my house at 5:00 pm tomorrow. I'm excited to see you there!
Dialogue||Oh, okay. I'm sorry, I guess I just thought... Well, nevermind.
Dialogue||Enchanting with this wedding ring on my finger has been a new experience. Nivara tells me wearing it will make enchanting more difficult, but I don't want to take it off!
Dialogue||Why would a ring make enchanting harder?
Dialogue||Is the ring really that important to you?
Dialogue||When I enchant living things, the non-living material of the ring somewhat disrupts the flow of magic through my fingers as I work.
Dialogue||It really isn't much, and besides, I love keeping it on even while I'm working.
Dialogue||Of course it is, XX. It's a symbol of our love, and of the beginning of our life together. Enchanting, at a basic level, is about combining the elements of different things.
Dialogue||This ring is like an enchantment, the combination of you and I.
Dialogue||Won't your work suffer?
Dialogue||I don't mind if you have to take it off for your work.
Dialogue||Have some faith in your wife, XX. It'll take more than one little ring to get in the way of my enchanting. Even if that "one little ring" is the most important ring in my life.
Dialogue||That's so sweet, Iris.
Dialogue||It's just a ring.
Dialogue||Maybe it's sweet, but it's also true. We're an enchantment together, and this ring is what proves it!
Dialogue||Maybe to you it's just a ring. It means a lot more to me, though.
Dialogue||I remember, one day I was feeding the fish in Nivara's pools when she told me I had great purpose. I'm still not sure what she meant by that.
Dialogue||Do <i>you</i> feel like you have great purpose?
Dialogue||Can't you ask her to explain?
Dialogue||I'm... not even sure what that means, to be honest. The Elder has purpose, but he's been leading us for generations.
Dialogue||I'm still so young. It's hard to know what my purpose is supposed to be.
Dialogue||"The most important lessons are learned, not told."
Dialogue||Yeah, that's Nivara. She loves to make you work for your wisdom...
Dialogue||I bet you'll figure it out without even trying.
Dialogue||If you're this confused, maybe Nivara was wrong.
Dialogue||You really believe that? Well... darn it, if you can then why can't I?
Dialogue||I guess the first step is learning how to believe in myself. Ugh, I can already tell this will be fun...
Dialogue||That's impossible! The World Dragon has never led me astray, not in enchanting and not in life. Her wisdom is absolute, XX. I'm... a little shocked you even said that.
Dialogue||That's pretty smart.
Dialogue||That seems unhelpful.
Dialogue||You think so? It drives me crazy... Not to sound ungrateful, but sometimes I just want a direct answer.
Dialogue||I agree. But at the same time, I understand her point. It's a little annoying that she's always right.
Dialogue||Have you been doing much cooking? You sure do grow enough ingredients, I'm sure.
Dialogue||Do you like to cook?
Dialogue||If you weren't a writer, what would you do for work?
Dialogue||I enjoy cooking, and I'm at least good enough at it to feed Pod. If I'm feeling tired though, I'll order him food from the tavern. He goes wild for tavern food!
Dialogue||Hm, it's difficult to say. Because of my heart condition, I can't do any kind of hard physical work.
Dialogue||Though I suppose if I weren't a writer, I could become a cartographer and illustrate maps. I used to like looking at maps as a girl and imagining all of the cities and the people living in them.
Dialogue||I'd take a mom's home cooking over tavern food any day.
Dialogue||Most taverns do make pretty good food.
Dialogue||Aw, that's sweet! Pod is just a kid, so I don't blame him for wanting tavern food. Maybe when he's older he'll appreciate my food a bit more.
Dialogue||It's true, Ronald really knows how to work an oven. Maybe I should ask him for some advice.
Dialogue||Drawing maps? That would be an amazing job!
Dialogue||That's too much like writing.
Dialogue||Do you think so? Maybe I should really look into it then. I'm not the greatest artist, but I'm sure I could learn!
Dialogue||Is it? I don't really see how.
Dialogue||Work hard for me, okay? I'll be sure to work hard for you!
Dialogue||It's hard to balance thinking about enchanting and thinking about you, XX, but it's a fun little challenge.
Dialogue||It doesn't feel like a proper day without seeing you.
Dialogue||Hey, XX! Two words: Tree. Bark. Noodles. Well, okay, that's three words. But still, this is going to be big.
Dialogue||There you are, XX. I thought living with somebody would become a chore, but it's just the opposite with you.
Dialogue||I'm just thinking of our future together.
Dialogue||Are you happy in our relationship, Iris?
Dialogue||Good thoughts, I hope?
Dialogue||I never thought I'd be so happy, if you want me to be honest. I don't want to imagine a future without you in it, XX.
Dialogue||<i>Very</i> good thoughts, Iris.
Dialogue||The future I see for us is nothing but goodness.
Dialogue||Thank goodness... I got a little worried there, XX! Be careful when you do that to me.
Dialogue||That's exactly how I feel.
Dialogue||I don't think our relationship is that serious.
Dialogue||If you feel the same way, then I see no reason to not take our relationship even further. If you're truly ready for that, of course. Oh, now my heart is racing...
Dialogue||I thought we were on the same page about this... I don't know how I was so wrong.
Dialogue||Raising Pod on my own isn't easy, but I wouldn't trade it for anything in the world.
Dialogue||Liam laughs a lot when we play games. I laugh, too!
Dialogue||I've heard tales that Withergate is a city in eternal darkness. How depressing that must be.
Dialogue||Do you not like the night?
Dialogue||The people living in Withergate must love it.
Dialogue||Well, no, that's not it. I quite like night, actually. It gives life a chance to rest. It also allows other types of life to flourish, under the light of the stars.
Dialogue||But eternal night? Without ever seeing the sun? So many plants and animals would perish. I don't think I'd fare any better, either.
Dialogue||Maybe they do. I suppose I can't judge, but still... the thought of endless night gives me a chill. Is it true that Demons can not tolerate sunlight?
Dialogue||The sun is the giver of energy and life. It's odd to imagine anyone could live without it.
Dialogue||Good thing you're in Nel'Vari!
Dialogue||You don't sound cut out for Withergate.
Dialogue||Yes, I'm comfortable as can be right where I am. I was born for Nel'Vari. Let Withergate keep its eternal night!
Dialogue||You aren't making fun of me, are you, XX? I love living in Nel'Vari. Let Withergate keep its eternal night!
Dialogue||Think of how life must have adapted to the dark.
Dialogue||You sound pretty judgmental.
Dialogue||That's a good point. Surely there must be plenty of flora and fauna in and around this Withergate. Life tends to find a way, even if it's living in an endless night.
Dialogue||Do I? I'm not trying to be, but the concept is just so strange to me. I'm sorry, I just have a hard time grasping it.
Dialogue||People say we have the best service in the entire Western Region. You won't hear any argument from me!
Dialogue||Should I get a pet? Oops, I'm thinking out loud. Good thing Pod didn't hear!
Dialogue||Good seeing you again, XX. I'm glad I could catch you between projects. Enchanting is busy work, you know.
Dialogue||What do you do when you're not working?
Dialogue||If you weren't an enchantress, what would you do instead?
Dialogue||I'm always trying to learn what I can, so I read a lot of books. Sometimes I'll read something that leads to a big discovery!
Dialogue||That's easy. I would definitely be a woodworker - I know, predictable answer.
Dialogue||That just sounds like more work.
Dialogue||What do you mean by "big discovery?" It sounds interesting!
Dialogue||Really? I think it's fun. Maybe I do work too much... aaand I already decided that I don't care.
Dialogue||Well, I figured out how to make flowers fireproof. Oh, and last year I managed an interesting serum that doubles the number of roots a plant has! That one was big.
Dialogue||Am I bragging? I feel like I'm bragging.
Dialogue||That was maybe not as predictable as you think.
Dialogue||Of course, I totally saw that coming!
Dialogue||Oh, really? Lots of Elves are woodworkers. For me, it's just another way to feel close to nature.
Dialogue||I feel connected to nature when I'm enchanting, but it's different with woodcraft. Feeling the wood with your hands and working with it to create something beautiful... It's just different.
Dialogue||Is it just me, or do my tattoos look a little darker?
Dialogue||Elizabeth is shortest but only by a little bit.
Dialogue||Look here, my newest favorite customer. Take a seat, XX.
Dialogue||I want you to think of this place as your home away from home.
Dialogue||You're so hospitable Mari, I can't imagine anyone giving you trouble.
Dialogue||Is it difficult running the inn upstairs?
Dialogue||You'd be surprised then. There's always some troublemakers comin' through with the season.
Dialogue||The only difficulty is when squatters don't want to leave. I guess I can't blame 'em though. Our beds are mighty comfy!
Dialogue||Thank goodness they're only seasonal!
Dialogue||You just point them out to me, and I'll take care of them.
Dialogue||Hah, seasonal! Yep, I guess that's right. All the good eggs stay right here in Sun Haven.
Dialogue||I've been doin' that job for twenty years now. Believe you me, I can handle it.
Dialogue||How do you get them out?
Dialogue||Does that happen a lot?
Dialogue||One time we had to smoke 'em out of the room they were in. Usually we just use the keys, though.
Dialogue||Not a lot, but maybe once or twice a year. Only during the busy season, though. Which lately, there hasn't been much of any busy season.
Dialogue||Well hello there, welcome on in. I'm Mari, and I'll be takin' good care of you today.
Dialogue||Hi Mari, I'm XX. I just moved in
Dialogue||Then that must make you the farmer. Lucia made her rounds and gave us all a heads up. Glad to have ya in Sun Haven!
Dialogue||Hi! You're our new neighbor!
Dialogue||What's something funny about your brother Liam?
Dialogue||Do you like it in Sun Haven?
Dialogue||Funny? Like how Liam makes funny faces at us when we go to bed?
Dialogue||Sun Haven is fun. I play with Topi and Pod at school. Mister Jun gives us candy when we do good!
Dialogue||Is he good at making faces?
Dialogue||Does that make you sleepy?
Dialogue||He makes the best funny faces!
Dialogue||Only when we're done with laughing. Sometimes we laugh a loooong time!
Dialogue||I bet you get lots of candy.
Dialogue||Candy is bad for you.
Dialogue||I do!! Hehehehe.
Dialogue||Nuh-uh, you just want my candy for yourself. I'm telling Liam that you want to take my candy away!
Dialogue||Do you think plants know when we're talking about them? That might make for an interesting experiment...
Dialogue||I asked Liam if we could get a puppy but he got sweaty like when he's nervous.
Dialogue||You're married now, XX. Does it feel like a big change?
Dialogue||You're married, too!
Dialogue||Will our marriage get in the way of your work?
Dialogue||And for me it feels... strangely natural. I don't know if I believe in fate, but it feels like we belong with each other. Like it was supposed to be this way.
Dialogue||I thought by now you'd have known not to worry about that. I am an enchanter, but I'm also your wife. I wouldn't have married you if I thought things wouldn't work out.
Dialogue||You're the same way, right?
Dialogue||It feels like a natural change to me, too.
Dialogue||That sounds silly to me.
Dialogue||See? I knew you felt it, too. It's almost kind of eerie, but in a good way.
Dialogue||Do you think so? I really thought you would feel the same way, but I've been wrong before.
Dialogue||I'd give up farming for you, if I had to!
Dialogue||You're right, my work is important to me.
Dialogue||Really?! For me? I never thought you'd do something like that! Oh, now I'm a little guilty for how I felt. You won't hold it against me, will you?
Dialogue||We both made a smart choice with each other, XX. That's how you can tell our relationship is built to last.
Dialogue||Hello, XX! It's fun having you around Nel'Vari nowadays.
Dialogue||It reminds me of when I was a kid. More travelers used to come through back then.
Dialogue||Do you have a favorite memory from growing up here?
Dialogue||Iris, I was wondering if you would go on a date with me!
Dialogue||Let me think... There was that time when my friend Angel d'Argy and I climbed to the top of the Grand Tree - and I don't mean the Elder's room, I mean the very tippy-top!
Dialogue||Oh, yeah? Funny, I never thought you would have cared.
Dialogue||Okay XX, I think it sounds fun!
Dialogue||Isn't that dangerous?
Dialogue||How did you manage to climb that high?
Dialogue||Well it isn't like we were clinging to the bark or anything. There used to be sturdy knots on the Grand Tree that you could climb on to get to the top.
Dialogue||It was easy when I was little, but I got too big and took a tumble so... I don't try it anymore.
Dialogue||It's a date!
Dialogue||On second thought, maybe we should just stay friends.
Dialogue||Hehe, you're cute. Come by my house tomorrow, then. Say, 12:00 pm?
Dialogue||Oh, okay. Ha ha. Good one, XX, you got me.
Dialogue||I could go for some noodles...
Dialogue||Pod asks about you all the time, you know. You're turning into a real role model for him.
Dialogue||What does Pod ask about?
Dialogue||Do you have a role model here in Sun Haven?
Dialogue||Mostly what you're doing or where you're going. He even asks when he'll be able to go help you on your farm. It's the cutest thing!
Dialogue||A role model? I'm not sure... if I had to choose, I suppose it would have to be Lucia. She's still young, but she's dedicated.
Dialogue||I'd be happy to have Pod's help!
Dialogue||I don't need some kid running around my farm.
Dialogue||Heh, he will be delighted to hear that!
Dialogue||Though on second thought, maybe not. I don't know how I feel about him using those tools...
Dialogue||Goodness, XX. He's just a curious boy, you know. He won't actually bother you.
Dialogue||Is it weird to call her a role model since she's so young?
Dialogue||Lucia is a good choice.
Dialogue||She may be younger than me, but her work ethic is inspiring. If she can take care of an entire town, there's no reason I can't take care of one little Pod.
Dialogue||Hey there sweetie-pie, what can we get ya today?
Dialogue||What's good to eat here, anyway?
Dialogue||Actually, I was wondering how long you've run this tavern.
Dialogue||Oh you can't make a wrong choice. Ronald and I make mean meals and refreshin' drinks, either way. Menu's up at the counter if your stomach's grumblin'.
Dialogue||Oh you sweet thing, did you really come by just to chat? Bless your heart.
Dialogue||Ronald and I renovated it... oh, must've been nearly twenty years ago now. Time sure flies!
Dialogue||It smells great in here, I'm sure the food is delicious.
Dialogue||Those drinks really do look good.
Dialogue||Order up at the counter whenever you're ready, hun. And don't feel shy around the tip jar now!
Dialogue||Well, order up at the counter whenever you're ready hun. We'll take care of ya, and don't feel shy around the tip jar now!
Dialogue||No wonder it looks so old.
Dialogue||You two have been incredibly successful!
Dialogue||Now XX, you might be mistakin' that for a compliment but that's now how I'm takin' it...
Dialogue||Don't sound so surprised, hun! You seen us here firsthand, workin' our magic.
Dialogue||Maybe I'll go to the beach today.
Dialogue||Don't worry about interrupting my work, it's not going anywhere.
Dialogue||Seeds that grow without dirt! Plants that pick themselves! ...Trees that grow gems instead of fruit?
Dialogue||Oh! You scared me, XX!
Dialogue||Are you alright?
Dialogue||You sound like you have some pretty wild ideas.
Dialogue||Sorry about that. I was just lost in thought, I guess. I'm feeling extra-inspired today and my imagination is running wild!
Dialogue||When I really get to thinking big, it's like the rest of the world kind of blurs out. Like I'm really in my own little zone.
Dialogue||Well, I'm just in a brainstorming phase right now. No idea is a bad one! Well, at least right now. I'll let my imagination run rampant and then weed out the bad ones later.
Dialogue||You don't have to apologize, just be yourself.
Dialogue||You should still pay attention to other people.
Dialogue||Most people seem to find it annoying. The Elder always scolds me about being more aware of myself and others, but I just want to focus on my ideas.
Dialogue||I thought you were different from everyone else in Nel'Vari, but right now you're sadly sounding very much like them.
Dialogue||"Weed out," hah. I get it. Plants.
Dialogue||So this is where all your grand ideas start.
Dialogue||I wasn't trying to make a pun, I guess my self-weeding weeds are still on my mind right now... that reminds me... sunflowers that actually grow little suns!
Dialogue||Like a lamp... Hmmm...
Dialogue||Most of them, anyway. Brainstorming is a very turbulent and fun process. Don't worry about plausibility, just come up with anything you can imagine.
Dialogue||That reminds me... sunflowers that actually grow little suns! Like a lamp... Hmmm...
Dialogue||How have you been enjoying Nel'Vari? Is it everything you thought the home of the Elves would be?
Dialogue||You married an Elf <i>and</i> an enchantress, but I'm the one who feels lucky to have you, XX.
Dialogue||Hello there, you're the new neighbor? I'm happy to make your acquaintance. I'm Pod's mother, Kara.
Dialogue||Hi Kara, my name is XX.
Dialogue||XX, now that's a nice name. I'm glad that old farm has someone to care for it now. It used to be so beautiful.
Dialogue||Do you have a question about my work?
Dialogue||Sometimes it's nice to take things slow. Even Sun Haven has slowed down these days.
Dialogue||Good to see ya again, XX. What brings ya in today?
Dialogue||What are the people like at the inn?
Dialogue||Your tavern is very cozy. There's an inn upstairs too?
Dialogue||These visitors, I tell ya. Baker's dozen, you know? For every twelve good donuts, you get that one weird donut. I keep 'em in line though.
Dialogue||Yup, travelers need a place to refuel and rest their sore behinds.
Dialogue||I'm sure it helps that Ronald is here, too.
Dialogue||You show 'em who's boss, Mari.
Dialogue||Like I said, I got 'em under control.
Dialogue||Thanks doll, I can tell you'll be on my good side. Come by anytime, I'll be sure to take care of ya!
Dialogue||Sore behinds?
Dialogue||Do you get any travelers that have seen Withergate? Or is it just a rumor?
Dialogue||What do ya think they're sitting on for those long hours on horseback?
Dialogue||In this business, you never know what's true and what's not. Could be real stories, could just be a loon looking for some attention.
Dialogue||Truth be told, I hope they're just rumors...
Dialogue||The Elven Elder told me they approved of our union. You may not quite grasp the significance of that, but it's really amazing!
Dialogue||What's the significance of the approval?
Dialogue||Haven't you met anyone outside of Nel'Vari before?
Dialogue||It means you're fully recognized as part of Nel'Vari. I didn't need the approval of the Elder to marry you, but it does mean you're an honorary member of Nel'Vari.
Dialogue||Isn't that wonderful?
Dialogue||Only a few people, travelers in the forest. Nobody that caught my eye.
Dialogue||I guess I could get myself out more. Outside of Nel'Vari, I mean.
Dialogue||I'm glad to be accepted as part of Nel'Vari.
Dialogue||I don't need an Elven Elder to tell me what I am.
Dialogue||Aw, I knew it would happen eventually. You've spent so much time there, and of course marrying me. There was no way you wouldn't be recognized by the Elder.
Dialogue||Calm down, XX. It's just an old traditional thing. No one is trying to control you.
Dialogue||I'll show you Sun Haven one day!
Dialogue||It's not worth it. The forests are too dangerous.
Dialogue||Really? The Human town, huh? I could learn a lot by walking around your town!
Dialogue||I can very well handle myself, XX. I could even teach you a thing or two.
Dialogue||To think that the first day we met was the start of a journey that ended with marriage. I'm glad that's how it turned out, XX.
Dialogue||Hello, XX. Another fine day in Nel'Vari, isn't it?
Dialogue||Hey sweetie, don't forget to take some time off your feet today.
Dialogue||Aren't you just a busy bee!
Dialogue||Oh? Sorry, you surprised me. We don't get many new faces around here. My name is Iris.
Dialogue||I didn't mean to surprise you. I'm XX.
Dialogue||XX, interesting name. If nobody has said it yet, welcome to Nel'Vari.
Dialogue||I work mainly with plants, but animals are just as vital to the environment.
Dialogue||I'm not supposed to talk to strangers.
Dialogue||I'm your new neighbor! My name is XX.
Dialogue||Ooh, the farmer? Liam said we were getting a farmer!
Dialogue||I'm Emma. Liam's my big brother!
Dialogue||You've been on my mind ever since our date. XX, I'm really glad we got together.
Dialogue||Does it feel weird dating someone outside of Nel'Vari?
Dialogue||Have you been in a relationship like this before?
Dialogue||Well... yes, it does. I always thought my life would take place entirely inside of Nel'Vari. But I know that exploring new parts of the world can't be a bad thing.
Dialogue||I've been on some dates with a couple Elves in town but it isn't the same. I mean, you're from a whole different part of the world. There's so much we can learn from each other!
Dialogue||XX, I haven't been this excited about anything in a long time.
Dialogue||Are you uncomfortable with it?
Dialogue||Is it at least a little bit exciting?
Dialogue||Sure I am, but it's a good kind of uncomfortable. Like when I'm performing an experiment with unknown results.
Dialogue||The thought of visiting you in Sun Haven is scary. I've never been that far outside of home. But... it's time for some new experiences! As long as you're with me, I mean.
Dialogue||Oh, yes XX! I don't want to make you think I'm not interested. I'm truly ecstatic that we're together.
Dialogue||It's just that the thought of visiting you in Sun Haven is scary. I've never been that far outside of home. But... it's time for some new experiences! As long as you're with me, I mean.
Dialogue||We're going to learn so much together, Iris!
Dialogue||Are you sure you're interested in me and not just my background?
Dialogue||This might be weird, but I've never been more attracted to you than right now. Haha!
Dialogue||Hm, that could very well be the dumbest thing I've heard you say. That's good! I was worried that you were a little too perfect.
Dialogue||When're you going to bring in some of those fresh farm goods so Ronald can whip up something fancy?
Dialogue||Hi XX. Today I saw a flower bud that made me think of you. It just started to bloom!
Dialogue||Is that because I'm... pretty like a flower?
Dialogue||You're so charming. I've never met anyone like you before, Iris.
Dialogue||Maybe! Or maybe it's because you're soft and gentle. With me, at least. Also, you smell surprisingly nice!
Dialogue||Like me, huh? Well I can't <i>not</i> dig into that a little bit. Please, explain!
Dialogue||I'm not soft - I'm tough.
Dialogue||I'm liking this flower bud image more and more.
Dialogue||All right, relax. You're not fooling anyone with the tough act.
Dialogue||Haha, you're such a dork. I mean it about the smell, though. You should smell like mud and sweat, but you just smell... really good!
Dialogue||You're brilliant and intensely focused.
Dialogue||You're gorgeous and totally independent.
Dialogue||Heh, thanks XX!
Dialogue||We're already dating, but it feels like you're getting ready to ask me out again... What are you planning?
Dialogue||How's your day goin', hun? You gettin' by all right?
Dialogue||Yesterday I found a really long bug behind the house! I showed it to Liam but he ran away. That's when I learned not everyone likes bugs.
Dialogue||You like bugs?
Dialogue||Did Liam really run away?
Dialogue||I think theyre weird. So, yes! You like bugs too, right?
Dialogue||My brother doesn't like bugs like me. One time he found little beetles in the flour and screamed!
Dialogue||Bugs are gross!
Dialogue||Bugs are cool!
Dialogue||Aww, you don't like them? Maybe you just haven't found the right bug.
Dialogue||You like them too?? Oh, I heard there's some real big bugs in the forest!
Dialogue||You must be brave to play with bugs.
Dialogue||Be sure to wash your hands - bugs are dirty!
Dialogue||I don't know. It's fun to me, not scary.
Dialogue||That's what Liam always says. I'm really good about washing hands now.
Dialogue||Did Nel'Vari just get a little warmer? Oh, it's you, XX!
Dialogue||Vaan told me you're a farmer. Why didn't you tell me that you work with plants, too??
Dialogue||I know you work mostly with plants, but have you ever tried your magic on animals?
Dialogue||Do you enjoy working with plants all the time?
Dialogue||Casting enchantments on animals is a big mistake. The spell has to be exactly correct because even the tiniest miscalculation can have huge effects. Trees and rocks are safer, trust me.
Dialogue||Oh yeah, I absolutely love plants! It's why I've dedicated my work to them, of course. They're so important to our world, don't you agree?
Dialogue||You didn't answer the question.
Dialogue||You seem to know a lot about how difficult it is.
Dialogue||... Okay look, I only tried it once when I was really young. I took a bucket of worms and tried to make them all bigger. Instead I made a kind of... worm ball. It wasn't pretty and I never tried again.
Dialogue||I don't really care for plants.
Dialogue||Absolutely, plants keep us all alive!
Dialogue||How can you think that?
Dialogue||That's exactly right, we wouldn't last a year without plants. No wonder you found your way into Nel'Vari - you really think like one of us!
Dialogue||Consider this: plants can't live without animals, and animals can't live without plants. The solution? Balance.
Dialogue||Have you seen my boy today? Oh nevermind, it's impossible to keep an eye on him.
Dialogue||Maybe someday I can visit your farm. It would be interesting to combine your farming with my enchanting.
Dialogue||I never told you, I think it's really impressive how you found your way into NelVari!
Dialogue||Have you been outside of Nel'Vari much?
Dialogue||How do you feel about Nel'Vari being so secretive?
Dialogue||Mostly just to gather different kinds of plants. I don't like to stray too far, though. The farther I get from Nel'Vari, the more I worry. I can't explain it exactly, but it feels like being exposed.
Dialogue||I think it's a bit much, honestly. But the Elder can tell you stories of intruders from the past. I guess our culture came close to being wiped out, once.
Dialogue||It's frightening stuff, so I understand why we take precautions now.
Dialogue||The world is a big place, it can be intimidating.
Dialogue||That's silly, you should explore the world.
Dialogue||It's something like that, yeah. It's nice that you understand - even if I don't fully understand myself.
Dialogue||I don't think it's silly at all. I'm happy here, so why leave?
Dialogue||Do you worry about that happening again?
Dialogue||With that in mind, it makes sense that you would hide yourselves.
Dialogue||No, I'm not worried. It's not worth the risk to our society to <i>not</i> have the protection spell in place.
Dialogue||I came to the same realization when the Elder told me what happened.
Dialogue||You're really starting to see things like a Nel'Vari Elf! I'm glad the Elder welcomed you into our home.
Dialogue||I wonder what Sun Haven will look like in one hundred years.
Dialogue||I'm never too invested in work to pass up a friend. How's it going, XX?
Dialogue||Oh, hello farmer. Good to see you out.
Dialogue||I haven't seen you in town much.
Dialogue||Pod seems like a handful.
Dialogue||I don't go out a lot. Most days I just don't have the energy for an outing, especially after playing with Pod in the morning.
Dialogue||He can be, but I like to see him living life his way. If he gets into a little trouble every now and then - so what? At least he's happy.
Dialogue||Are you okay?
Dialogue||Why are you so tired?
Dialogue||Oh yes, thank you. I have a heart condition that gives me fatigue, but it's under control. Doctor Wornhardt and Catherine have both done wonders for me.
Dialogue||I have a heart condition that gives me fatigue, but it's under control. Doctor Wornhardt and Catherine have both done wonders for me!
Dialogue||All that matters is that he's happy and safe.
Dialogue||That doesn't seem very responsible.
Dialogue||I couldn't agree more.
Dialogue||Thanks for the parenting advice, farmer! But I'll raise my son how I like.
Dialogue||Hey farmer! Moooooo.
Dialogue||Elizabeth is my sister!
Dialogue||I feel like a tree in Spring - everything is fresh and new! I look forward to my life with you, XX.
Dialogue||You know I never mentioned it before, but your tattoos are beautiful.
Dialogue||What do you imagine when you think of our future?
Dialogue||All this time and you're only now commenting on them? I mean, thank you and all, but where did that come from?
Dialogue||Hm... Well for one, I see a lot of plants! My enchanting could really bring your farm to the next level, you know.
Dialogue||Otherwise, I'm trying not to overthink our relationship, XX. I like to take things as they come.
Dialogue||Maybe it's just the light, but I swear you're glowing!
Dialogue||I'm just saying, your tattoos suit you elegantly.
Dialogue||Okay, weirdo! Haha, I'm just kidding, XX. Mostly.
Dialogue||You know, we give our people these tattoos at a very young age. They're supposed to be a representation of our spirit. At least, I think that's right. You might have to check that with the Elder.
Dialogue||Maybe we aren't on the same page after all.
Dialogue||I love that you stay in the present moment.
Dialogue||Well I can't know what you're thinking all the time, XX.
Dialogue||That's another of Nivara's teachings, actually. "The only time is now" or something along those lines. I really took it to heart, actually.
Dialogue||Thanks for saying hi, hun. You sure you're not just doing that to stay on my good side? Either way, it's working!
Dialogue||Hey there, XX. Care to talk for a moment? I'm taking a break from the enchanting table.
Dialogue||With all of your enchanting, when do you find time for woodworking?
Dialogue||Is your brooch enchanted, too?
Dialogue||It's tough, I'll admit. I don't practice my crafting as much as I should.
Dialogue||Maybe it's because my work as an enchantress is for the good of everyone, but my crafting is just for me.
Dialogue||This old thing? Heh, not at all. It was given to me by the Elven Elder.
Dialogue||Most Elves get something like this from the Elder when they pick a profession. I just wear it because it's nice.
Dialogue||Your happiness is important, Iris. If crafting makes you happy, then do it!
Dialogue||It's important to consider your people's needs above your own.
Dialogue||It really does make me happy. Maybe I really should spend more time on my woodworking. Thanks, XX, I'll think about it!
Dialogue||You really think so? Hm. You might be right. Maybe I should talk to the Elder about this...
Dialogue||That's a lovely tradition - the Elder chose well!
Dialogue||That sounds so formal. Is it a big deal?
Dialogue||You think so? I didn't love it at first, but it grew on me. Literally - I made it grow into my clothing so I don't have to worry about it coming loose.
Dialogue||I don't think so, but then again I'm not very strict about tradition. I mean, our culture is important and all, but I would never reject someone for not wearing a pin.
Dialogue||You should stop by more often. A friendly face is perfect for clearing my head.
Dialogue||I was never sure what to expect from marriage, but this is more ideal than I ever could have imagined.
Dialogue||You and I are a perfect balance, XX.
Dialogue||One of the gem cutters just got done carving a stunningly beautiful sapphire this morning. Its fresh edges caught the sunlight so fantastically!
Dialogue||I thought your passion was enchanting.
Dialogue||Lots of people in Sun Haven love gemstones too.
Dialogue||Of course I love the work that I do as an enchanter, it's what I've put my life towards mastering.
Dialogue||But I still can't resist a big, beautiful gemstone. Even if I don't appreciate them as a functional thing, they're just so pretty. That's worth something on its own, I think.
Dialogue||Oh really? So a love for shining gemstones isn't unique to Nel'Vari. Funny how the things that bridge different people together seem to be the most simple.
Dialogue||No advanced words or traditions... just shiny gemstones.
Dialogue||I had no idea you appreciated rocks so much.
Dialogue||Why don't you try using gemstones in your work?
Dialogue||Gemstones aren't rocks! Well, okay, they are. But they're beautiful products of the earth, whether freshly hewn from the mine or cut into a splendid shape.
Dialogue||They're two totally separate interests, XX. Gemstones are just pretty to look at or hold. I don't feel any need to try using them in my enchanting.
Dialogue||Looks like people really aren't all that different.
Dialogue||I don't think mutual interest in gemstones matters very much.
Dialogue||I guess we really aren't. Now I'm wondering what else Nel'Vari has in common with Sun Haven!
Dialogue||You need to try and see the bigger picture. It's not about the gemstones themselves, it's about similar interests connecting different people. Just forget about it, actually.
Dialogue||There's nothing like the smell of ever-blooming flowers in the air. I even got some woodworking in this morning! It's a nearly-perfect day, XX.
Dialogue||Is that why you look so giddy?
Dialogue||Hey, what would be a completely perfect day for you?
Dialogue||Actually... I wanted to get you something. It's a surprise! Think of it as a thank-you for our date. But before I give it to you, you have to promise to keep it safe.
Dialogue||A perfect day... I don't know about the whole day, but it would for sure start with sleeping in.
Dialogue||I promise!
Dialogue||I'm dying to know what the surprise is!
Dialogue||This totem is for you, XX. I carved it by hand. It carries a strong enchantment that should help you manage your magic. Please carry it with you - I worked hard to make it.
Dialogue||I can't believe you would waste your day by sleeping in!
Dialogue||Sleeping in, that sounds perfect!
Dialogue||Sorry to break it to you, XX, but I am NOT an early bird unless I have to be. I sleep in when I get the chance, but I always wake up on the right side of the bed.
Dialogue||I sleep in when I get the chance, but I always wake up on the right side of the bed.
Dialogue||Neighbors are friends! Liam said so.
Dialogue||Oh, XX. You're looking a little tired, are you working extra hard these days?
Dialogue||What about you? Have you been busy lately?
Dialogue||You work so much, how do you always seem so calm?
Dialogue||Not any more busy than usual, so... I guess that's still a yes. A project of mine is keeping me up at night. But self-planting seeds will be huge when I'm done!
Dialogue||Is that a bad thing? I don't like being too rowdy is all. Keeping myself calm helps me focus.
Dialogue||Just don't forget to take care of yourself.
Dialogue||It's lucky you have something to be excited about, at least.
Dialogue||I know you're right and I should treat myself better, but I get so wrapped up in my research that I just don't have the capacity to care.
Dialogue||Thanks XX. Most people just lecture me on self-care. They're not wrong or anything, I just don't have the capacity to care right now.
Dialogue||You should let your feelings out more often.
Dialogue||It shows great self-control.
Dialogue||Don't assume that I'm suppressing my feelings just because I'm calm. Did you ever think that maybe I'm just, actually calm?
Dialogue||That's the first time anyone's ever said that about me. I usually get the opposite...
Dialogue||I just cracked a project I've been working on for the last few months. Self-trimming grass!
Dialogue||I'm curious how 'self-trimming' grass works.
Dialogue||It seems like such an innovative invention.
Dialogue||Okay, so it's not really "self-trimming" in the sense it cuts itself. But it only grows to a certain height!
Dialogue||This first variation tops out at around two inches, but now I can make future variants that grow to varying heights. Great for lawn control!
Dialogue||I look at life as being a never-ending race, there's always something you can improve and make better!
Dialogue||First I'll probably take it to Nivara and get her approval. She likes to have the first look at anything I create, at least. Then I'll show it off to the Elven Elder.
Dialogue||If he likes it, and believe me he always does, we'll roll it out around Nel'Vari. We'll just have to replace the native grass first, of course. But no more trimming!
Dialogue||How did you do it?
Dialogue||I can't even imagine how that works.
Dialogue||Great question! Well, let me explain in a way that's easy to understand...
Dialogue||Plants, like anything else that's living, have certain "switches" inside of them that tell them how big to grow. I just found a way to manipulate those switches in grass.
Dialogue||Well, let me explain in a way that's easy to understand...
Dialogue||The native grass is boring and unenchanted, anyways.
Dialogue||So the current grass has to be gotten rid of? That seems a bit extreme.
Dialogue||I don't think Nel'Vari's native grass is bad or anything, but I do love knowing that you're in-tune with perpetual progress!
Dialogue||That is how progress works, XX. My enchanted grass is easier to control, and will never have to be trimmed down to size.
Dialogue||But you didn't stop to consider any of that, did you?
Dialogue||It's impressive that you found your way into Nel'Vari. It says a lot about you as a person, I think.
Dialogue||XX, welcome back. It's a beautiful day in Nel'Vari, huh?
Dialogue||It seems like everyday is a beautiful day around here.
Dialogue||Do you like living in Nel'Vari, Iris?
Dialogue||You're right, we're really lucky. I've heard things about other parts of the world where there are no plants at all - just big flat spaces with rocks and sand. I've never seen it, but it sounds terrible!
Dialogue||Sure I do. I mean, this is the perfect place for my work.
Dialogue||I don't know. It's not like plants are much better.
Dialogue||I wouldn't be able to live without plants and animals around me.
Dialogue||What... but... plants are SO much better than rocks! They give us food and air, and rocks just give us... more rocks.
Dialogue||Oof, I need to cool off after that one.
Dialogue||I feel exactly the same way. Surrounding yourself with life makes life itself sweeter. Nivara told me that.
Dialogue||What makes it perfect for your work here?
Dialogue||Sounds like work is your main priority, huh?
Dialogue||My enchanting blends the lines between nature and magic. Nel'Vari does something similar, but with Elves. In a way, Nel'Vari is like one big natural experiment itself.
Dialogue||Enchanting is my life. The work is complicated and beautiful... but sometimes I get so focused on it that I forget other things. Like today, I can't remember if I've eaten anything!
Dialogue||I could really go for some noodles right now. There's a shop in the plaza that makes my favorite spicy ramen.
Dialogue||If you're going to the plaza then maybe you could grab me a bowl?? Thanks in advance!
Dialogue||XX, wonderful seeing you. I hope the farm is doing well.
Dialogue||Do you work, Kara?
Dialogue||What do you do for fun?
Dialogue||Yes, but my work can all be done from home. Thank goodness for that.
Dialogue||You must be wondering what I do. I write speeches for leaders across the world. Dignitaries, ambassadors, even a king or two.
Dialogue||I like to watch Topi and Pod running around the yard, or sometimes I'll dive into a new book. I'd really like to learn a craft, though.
Dialogue||Sitting around writing all day sounds unhealthy.
Dialogue||Kings?? You must be a great writer!
Dialogue||What a negative thing to focus on. Not that you need to know, but I take fine care of myself.
Dialogue||I should hope so!
Dialogue||All I do is wait for another job to come in the mail, write the speech, and send it back. My payment comes a few days later. It's the best job for me, in my situation.
Dialogue||What kind of craft?
Dialogue||What's stopping you?
Dialogue||Something with my hands, like pottery. Giuseppe has offered to get me some clay, but I don't want to be a bother to him.
Dialogue||Oh, I'm not sure. I just haven't taken the leap yet. Who knows, maybe today is the day that inspiration takes me.
Dialogue||Maybe... leatherwork? Or, needlepoint? There are so many possibilities!
Dialogue||Grrr...rr....
Dialogue||<b>ROOAAR!</b>
Dialogue||*sniff sniff*
Dialogue||Come aboard, traveler. Let us embark!
Dialogue||I'm ready.
Dialogue||I'd rather wait.
Dialogue||Don't be afraid to bug me if you have any questions!
Dialogue||Hello again, XX was it? I thought you might be back! It's great to see you again.
Dialogue||Have you been a seamstress your whole life?
Dialogue||Are you from Withergate?
Dialogue||I learned the skill as a young girl, but it hasn't been my only occupation for my whole life. Before I found Withergate, I used to perform in a travelling circus. I was a tap dancer!
Dialogue||Nobody is really "from" Withergate, silly! Everyone just finds their way here one way or another, like how you found your way into my shop today.
Dialogue||Your act must have been outstanding!
Dialogue||The circus? That makes a lot of sense.
Dialogue||You're such a dear! And you're right, too. Nobody else dancing tap could keep up with me!
Dialogue||I wasn't there as a "freak" or anything so demeaning, you know. I have real talent on stage. Oh well, you wouldn't know talent if it waved six hands in front of your face.
Dialogue||Do you like it here?
Dialogue||Do you think you'll stay here forever?
Dialogue||Withergate is a nice enough city. I only wish it were cleaner, but that's a small price to pay for a place where all monsterfolk can live peacefully. There's no place in the world like Withergate!
Dialogue||Nice of you to drop in!
Dialogue||Looking for a new look? Look no further!
Dialogue||You're such a cutie! I'm glad to have you in my web.
Dialogue||Don't be afraid to come right up to the counter, sweetie.
Dialogue||I thought I felt somebody bouncing on my web out there! Welcome to my shop, traveler, I hope you find something you like. Everything you see is handmade by me!
Dialogue||Good to meet you, my name is XX.
Dialogue||Well hello, XX. My name is Arianella. I'm the only silk-spinning seamstress you'll find in Withergate. I'm so very happy to have you here!
Dialogue||Nobody spins silk as fast as me.
Dialogue||<b>Between the three of us, I'm the most knowledgable.</b>
Dialogue||<i>But I'mmmm the mosssst charrrrming.</i>
Dialogue||We can give you the finest tips on hats.
Dialogue||<i>And the finesssst hats to tip.</i>
Dialogue||Welcome!
Dialogue||<b>Welcome.</b>
Dialogue||<i>Wellllcome...</i>
Dialogue||Hi... and hi, and hi. My name is XX!
Dialogue||<b>XX, a strong name.</b>
Dialogue||You can call us Triberius. Welcome to our haberdashery!
Dialogue||<i>Oh, just say "hat shop" for goodnessss sake...</i>
Dialogue||<b>It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance.</b>
Dialogue||Take a look around and let us know if you need a hand.
Dialogue||<b>Or six!</b>
Dialogue||<i>We can accomplish many thingssss when we put our headssss together.</i>
Dialogue||She tells that joke to every new customer.
Dialogue||A fine traveler like yourself should have a distinguished look.
Dialogue||<b>And there's nothing more distinguished than a quality hat, wouldn't you say?</b>
Dialogue||So you've returned! Care to try on some of our wares?
Dialogue||<i>Yessss, try something onnnn.</i>
Dialogue||<b>Or are you looking for a spot of conversation?</b>
Dialogue||Triberius, did you get into the hat business because...
Dialogue||I have to ask, were you born this way?
Dialogue||<b>Because we have three heads? Haha!</b>
Dialogue||Don't mind him, he lives to make people uncomfortable. Actually, we started making hats to raise enough money to buy a new home.
Dialogue||<i>But then we heard about Withergate and it sounded like jusssst the place for ussss.</i>
Dialogue||Since we already knew how to make hats, we opened a haberdashery!
Dialogue||<b>Really, nobody knows what a haberdashery is. Please, just say "hat shop!"</b>
Dialogue||As a matter of fact, we were changed this way by a dark wizard. There was a time when we were three separate creatures.
Dialogue||<i>The dark wizzzzard, he made us like thissss to guard his storeroom of pricelessss scrollssss. He chained ussss up at the entrancccce, but nobody ever came to ssssteal them.</i>
Dialogue||<b>Indeed, we became quite bored by the task.</b>
Dialogue||So we broke our bonds and escaped to make our own life.
Dialogue||You three seem to bicker quite a bit.
Dialogue||Are you all angry at each other?
Dialogue||What do you expect? We're stuck with each other constantly, all the time, forever!
Dialogue||<b>There's bound to be a little conflict.</b>
Dialogue||<i>Nonsensssse. A little argument is part of the ffffun.</i>
Dialogue||<b>It's true, we fight with each other merely for fun. It may be juvenile, but it keeps us entertained.</b>
Dialogue||That's terrible, I'm sorry.
Dialogue||At least you have each other.
Dialogue||<i>It'ssss not so bad.</i>
Dialogue||<b>Yes, we've become quite used to each other by now.</b>
Dialogue||<i>That'ssss exactly how we see it.</i>
Dialogue||We've decided to stay positive about the situation.
Dialogue||<b>I'm proud to be stuck together with such fine creatures.</b>
Dialogue||<i>We make evvvvery hat by hannnnd.</i>
Dialogue||<b>You won't find better quality anywhere else.</b>
Dialogue||Oh, hello. Are you here to make an offering to gain the Moon Dragon's good graces?.
Dialogue||I'm going to stop Dynus..
Dialogue||Can you explain the altars?.
Dialogue||Oh, dear. That must mean you came here to fight the Moon Dragon himself. Well, thank you for letting me know. It's always easier to clean up his challengers when I have warning.
Dialogue||Dynus is in the next room straight ahead. And allow me to extend my sympathies, for your imminent loss.
Dialogue||As you can see, this is the altar room. These are the altars at which peasants such as yourself may present an offering to the Moon Dragon in an attempt to gain his blessing.
Dialogue||Simply place a tribute in the correct altar and Dynus shall receive it when the altar is full. When you're ready, Dynus is in the next room straight ahead.
Dialogue||Be warned, none yet have made an offering that the Moon Dragon has deemed satisfactory.
Dialogue||You've returned... Speak, or cease wasting my time.
Dialogue||Do you know Elios?
Dialogue||Why do you spread darkness and not light?
Dialogue||Yes... the Sun Dragon... Elios and I have a history that spans your lifetime... twenty times over.
Dialogue||Darkness is part of my soul... something I did not choose, but that always was. Even the guardian dragons... are subject to their fate.
Dialogue||His power is nothing compared to yours.
Dialogue||He's the most powerful dragon I've met.
Dialogue||Truer words have never been spoken... The Sun Dragon is mighty in name only. His light will soon be overcome... by my darkness.
Dialogue||Insolent whelp... You will soon realize how wrong you are.
Dialogue||So you can't spread light?
Dialogue||So your power isn't unlimited after all.
Dialogue||I can dissipate the darkness to make light... but that would be pointless. Light is a crutch... for those without real power.
Dialogue||As far as it concerns the likes of you... there is no difference.
Dialogue||What will you do once you've conquered your empire?
Dialogue||Are you able to grant a blessing?
Dialogue||I will do what rulers do... rule. As my power grows... my opposition will terminated.
Dialogue||I can, but I choose not to... Why reduce my power to increase that of someone else? It's simply... nonsense.
Dialogue||It sounds pointless to me.
Dialogue||Only a fool would try to resist you.
Dialogue||I'm unsurprised that a whelp like you... wouldn't comprehend my dominion.
Dialogue||Many have tried resisting... none have succeeded.
Dialogue||Your own power would be reduced?
Dialogue||But you're so powerful, would it even matter?
Dialogue||Of course... Every blessing a dragon grants will reduce its own power... Has Elios truly taught you nothing?
Dialogue||My power would not be reduced significantly... No, but the idea of giving my power away to some lowly creature... is appalling.
Dialogue||Is it hard maintaining this darkness spell at all times?
Dialogue||I've never seen a dragon with powers like yours.
Dialogue||It requires a certain concentration... but the energy I use is an insignificant fragment of my whole power. And of course... my hoard of magic crystals becomes quite useful.
Dialogue||There are no dragons like me. My power is mine alone... just as it is with all dragons.
Dialogue||Your power is infinite as long as you have those gems.
Dialogue||You'll run out of energy one day.
Dialogue||Indeed, which is why my dominion must be realized... Once my darkness encompasses the world, my power will be ultimate.
Dialogue||So short-sighted... Once my dominion is realized, I will never run out of energy... My hoard will grow. The whole world will work for me... to maintain my darkness.
Dialogue||Every dragon has different powers?
Dialogue||So where does your power come from?
Dialogue||A dragon's power comes from its soul... Where that power comes from, even I can't say.
Dialogue||So puny, so weak...
Dialogue||Do not be fooled... my patience should not be confused for mercy.
Dialogue||Were you a guardian dragon before you came to Withergate?
Dialogue||How did you come to Withergate?
Dialogue||No, that was never my purpose... I only guard Withergate for its convenience.
Dialogue||The Demon King is no fool... He possessed the sense to collect a hoard of glorite for me.
Dialogue||I sensed the accumulated power from across the globe... and flew straight here, where Minos was waiting with an offer of partnership.
Dialogue||So you're only here for the glorite?
Dialogue||Do you care about Withergate at all?
Dialogue||Indeed, there is no hoard like this anywhere else... in the entire world.
Dialogue||I care only... for what Withergate will do for my rise to power... This place is but a stepping stone... on my path to greatness.
Dialogue||You've secured a lot of power here.
Dialogue||You were fooled?
Dialogue||This is a mere fraction of what is to come... When my empire is complete, no power in this world... will rival mine.
Dialogue||Ignorant rat... None can fool me. I chose the partnership with Minos... for his hoard of powerful gems.
Dialogue||What do you think of the Demon King Minos?
Dialogue||Do the people worship you?
Dialogue||Ah, Minos... He is a capable and faithful follower, though he thinks himself my partner... Heh, let him think so.
Dialogue||I wouldn't know... I let the Demon King handle the people. It makes no difference... for they are below me.
Dialogue||That's not a good way to speak of your allies.
Dialogue||The king is a fool to think he's equal to you.
Dialogue||Minos is not my ally... he is my servant.
Dialogue||This is true, but that is bold talk... from a lowly wretch like you.
Dialogue||Don't you want to reward them for loving you?
Dialogue||What if they stop loving you?
Dialogue||That is not the job of a ruler. Foolish sentiment has no place... in my world.
Dialogue||I get nothing from their love... only their obedience.
Dialogue||Minos has done well running my city... so far.
Dialogue||You would dare waste my time... a foolhardy mistake.
Dialogue||Why are you helping the Demons?
Dialogue||How does a dragon become as powerful as you?
Dialogue||The Demons are a convenient vehicle for my dominion... Do not be confused, helping them is not my intent. They are a stepping tone... toward my empire.
Dialogue||Not all dragons are born equal... Some are mere serpents, but others... like myself... are born for greatness.
Dialogue||It seems like you're working for them.
Dialogue||What use do you have for an empire, anyway?
Dialogue||You know nothing... of my intentions.
Dialogue||I wouldn't expect a creature like you... to understand my dominion.
Dialogue||My empire must grow to maintain my power... but I wouldn't expect a creature like you... to understand my dominion.
Dialogue||So you were just lucky to be born this way?
Dialogue||Now I truly understand your superiority.
Dialogue||It is nothing to do with luck, whelp... It is providence.
Dialogue||Yes, now you see... and soon, everyone in this world will see.
Dialogue||What do you get from the offerings?
Dialogue||How old are you?
Dialogue||Offerings placed into the altar give me power... similar to the gems below me.
Dialogue||More importantly... it reminds my inferiors where they belong. I try to avoid needless cruelty... to those who revere me.
Dialogue||Age is irrelevant to my life... I've ceased counting the decades that drift by.
Dialogue||So you rely on the power that is given to you?
Dialogue||I'll prove myself to you.
Dialogue||I rely only on myself... Do not test me, puny hero. The offerings add little to my power... but I get satisfaction from the devotion of my subjects.
Dialogue||We shall see... and hurry.
Dialogue||So you don't even know how much longer you'll live?
Dialogue||You must be powerful if you've surpassed time.
Dialogue||Simple-minded weakling... Something as simple as time has no influence on a being as powerful as I am.
Dialogue||Centuries ago, in another land... Those loyal to me gave me a title... Dominus Mortis... Master of Death.
Dialogue||Withergate is only the inception of my empire.
Dialogue||We've treated all kinds of creatures in this room.
Dialogue||I know what you need - a hot cookie!
Dialogue||Wonderful to see you again!
Dialogue||The Grand Tree's energy is all around us. Can you feel it?
Dialogue||I love working in this beautiful tree!
Dialogue||Oh, a visitor! My name's Sasha.
Dialogue||I'm XX. What is this place?
Dialogue||This is the recovery room. We serve people and creatures of all kinds here. You're welcome to stay!
Dialogue||When I was only a girl, I spent many days climbing trees. I suppose not much has changed!
Dialogue||When the beetles get out of hand, we have to call Clemmett for help.
Dialogue||Hello, dearheart. Who might you be?
Dialogue||My name is XX, pleased to meet you.
Dialogue||Such proper manners, how lovely. Just call me Granny. Everyone else does!
Dialogue||Just visiting?
Dialogue||If you're feeling down, just come see Granny!
Dialogue||You must be tired, dear. Why not stay for a visit?
Dialogue||It's so nice to have visitors.
Dialogue||How lovely it is to see you, dearheart.
Dialogue||How lovely to see you again!
Dialogue||Oh dear, I hope you aren't hurt.
Dialogue||I'm not hurt, just visiting.
Dialogue||What do you do here, Granny?
Dialogue||Oh, how wonderful. I wish we had more visitors here. On the other hand, perhaps that's not best for the patients.
Dialogue||Well, peace and quiet is nice too!
Dialogue||I help in any way I can. Lately, that means baking plenty of cookies for our hungry friend here!
Dialogue||Do you get bored here?
Dialogue||The farm gets quiet, too.
Dialogue||Certainly, sometimes. But the slow times help me appreciate the thrills of life. Remember that the next time you're twiddling your thumbs, young one!
Dialogue||That's right, you're the farmer. How lovely! You must be well-acquainted with the peace and quiet.
Dialogue||I can feel it in your energy, too - such a calm, powerful spirit you have.
Dialogue||Keeping spirits high is important work.
Dialogue||It doesn't seem like you're needed here.
Dialogue||That's exactly right, dear! My, you speak like an old soul. So nice to see you again.
Dialogue||It pains me to see the younger generations so ill-mannered...
Dialogue||There's nobody we can't heal here.
Dialogue||Oh, you're already feeling well? We love having visitors, too!
Dialogue||What's with that animal?
Dialogue||Where did you learn your healing skills?
Dialogue||You mean the snaccoon? That's our latest patient. He had a tumble in the river, poor thing!
Dialogue||Nivara provided me the resources to get started and Iris taught me some practical skills. It's amazing what you can do with mana these days!
Dialogue||You're so kind for saving it!
Dialogue||Why are you helping it?
Dialogue||I didn't save it myself. Can you imagine me trying to haul that giant out of the water!
Dialogue||Thankfully Tornn and Rel'Tar were passing by. With their help, we got Snackers back to the recovery room here.
Dialogue||Oh, I've been calling him Snackers!
Dialogue||... What do you mean? Why <i>wouldn't</i> we help it? It's injured and needs help, that's that.
Dialogue||How is mana used for healing?
Dialogue||So you don't have medical experience?
Dialogue||Since mana flows through every living thing, it can be manipulated in predictable ways. All we do is guide extra energy to the spot of an injury and the mana does the work!
Dialogue||Maybe not in the way you're thinking. Our practices differ quite a bit from Sun Haven. It's not all that complicated, anyway.
Dialogue||We get it, you're a farming master. Hurry up and do what the Elder says, would you?
Dialogue||Show us how you farm in Sun Haven, XX!
Dialogue||Come on now, XX. Don't be so shy! Treat this just as you would your farm back home. Nel'Vari is a second home to you now, you know!
Dialogue||Seeing all the different people in Sun Haven makes me wonder what Nel'Vari would be like if it were more open.
Dialogue||How open do you mean?
Dialogue||What made you think of that?
Dialogue||Nel'Vari could benefit from the diversity Sun Haven experiences every day. If our village weren't hidden so deep in the forest, we could host travelers like the Humans do.
Dialogue||The Elven people could use an outside perspective. I don't see how we can progress as a society while never learning anything from the outside.
Dialogue||Speaking plainly, I think Sun Haven is everything a city should be. It has different people from every part of the world. I just wish I could live in a town like that.
Dialogue||A lot can be learned from traveling strangers.
Dialogue||Wouldn't that make you vulnerable to an attack?
Dialogue||That's exactly my point. Yes, Elves are masters of woodcraft and we have the World Dragon's wisdom behind us. I still think we Elves could be more.
Dialogue||I really admire the Humans' natural desire to expand their perspective. If only Elves were the same way...
Dialogue||Ah, so you've heard about the ancient attacks that nearly destroyed all of Nel'Vari? The Elder uses that excuse to justify our secrecy.
Dialogue||It's been hundreds of years since that attack. It's silly to keep hiding. XX, I hoped you would see through the Elder's lame excuses like I do.
Dialogue||You've learned things in Nel'Vari that most people never learn.
Dialogue||Every city has its interesting people.
Dialogue||That's true, having Nivara around is a major advantage. Especially for the Blessed who have magic within them.
Dialogue||Trying to get a handle on my magic without a dragon's guidance would have been nearly impossible.
Dialogue||Hm, well you're not wrong. I suppose we have Rel'Tar, not to mention the World Dragon herself. Maybe I'm taking my home for granted.
Dialogue||This was a good chat, XX.
Dialogue||I hear the legendary blacksmith Solon lives here. I wonder if he'd be willing to barter.
Dialogue||The people in Sun Haven live each day with such beautiful consistency. They go to their jobs, tend to their children, care for their animals... every day, just like clockwork.
Dialogue||Welcome, friend. Call me Scott. I'll supply whatever weaponry you need - or want!
Dialogue||I'm XX, good to meet you.
Dialogue||Like I said, XX. If you find yourself outmatched on the battlefield, come find me.
Dialogue||Oh! An unexpected face to find in Nel'Vari. So you managed to find your way to our city?
Dialogue||That's right. My name is XX, from Sun Haven.
Dialogue||Ah, Sun Haven. Of course. I'm Vaan, and it's a true pleasure to meet you.
Dialogue||Talk to me when you've planted those seeds and gathered some wood!
Dialogue||The sun sure is bright here.
Dialogue||The forest is fragrant today - can't you smell it?
Dialogue||You were probably fast asleep, but before daybreak this morning there was a fantastic fog blanketing the sky. So refreshing to fly through.
Dialogue||So you were up earlier than me, huh?
Dialogue||Don't you get cold when you fly?
Dialogue||Oh my, is the farmer feeling a little insecure? Not always the earliest to rise after all? I'm only joking with you.
Dialogue||Yeah, sometimes I like to wake up really early and go on flights. Watching the whole world light up beneath me in real time is always so breathtaking. It's like a reverse sunrise, I guess.
Dialogue||Well, yeah. Sort of. Honestly I've learned that 'cold' is mostly a state of mind! I guess that's my inner-Elf talking, but I've learned to feel a connection to the chill.
Dialogue||Like it doesn't bother me, it's just part of the experience. Which makes it part of me. Or does that sound a little silly?
Dialogue||Flying must be amazing.
Dialogue||Isn't there any downside to flying?
Dialogue||You can believe me when I say that it truly is. It is something about me that I will never relinquish. No matter what, who or why.
Dialogue||No, not really. I mean, if there's <i>one</i> bad thing, it's when I hit a bug. You ever smack face-first into a gnat while flying full speed?
Dialogue||Well, of course you haven't, but it feels like getting hit with a rock!
Dialogue||That's fascinating. So you're sort of cold-resistant?
Dialogue||Sounds kind of ridiculous.
Dialogue||Heh, I wouldn't say "resistant", more like "receptive". I'm receptive to the cold, because the cold is just part of the experience of flying.
Dialogue||Thanks for trying to get on my wavelength, XX. You're alright.
Dialogue||Hm. I shared that piece of info with you because I thought you'd be understanding of it. Guess I was wrong.
Dialogue||Just so you know, XX, I'd like it if you visited me more often.
Dialogue||I accidentally flew through a flock of birds yesterday. I think I was even more startled than them!
Dialogue||What is it like to fly?
Dialogue||Not so good with animals, huh?
Dialogue||So you actually are curious? I'm surprised you haven't asked already.
Dialogue||Flying is the most freeing experience in the world. It changes how you think about everything - distance, nature, and even other people.
Dialogue||I wouldn't say I'm bad with animals, but I don't have a lot of experience. Maybe I should talk to Clemmett for advice.
Dialogue||Is it really that important?
Dialogue||How did it change the way you think?
Dialogue||Absolutely. One day, I'll show you so you can see. Standing in one spot, it's easy to miss the squirrels in the trees or the deer on the other side of the lake.
Dialogue||You can see it all at once from above. That's when I realized that I'm just one small piece in a constantly changing picture.
Dialogue||I realized how active the world is. Standing in one spot, it's easy to miss the squirrels in the trees or the deer on the other side of the lake.
Dialogue||You have an intense energy, working with animals might be hard for you.
Dialogue||You have a gentle spirit, you could figure it out if you tried.
Dialogue||I haven't even tried yet, but you think I'd fail? I was hoping for a little more support from my own partner.
Dialogue||Even when I doubt myself, you lift me up. You're truly the wind in my wings, XX.
Dialogue||I was in the middle of a cloud meditation when a bird flapped past my head. When I opened my eyes, the first thing I saw was you on your farm.
Dialogue||I don't know, it felt like a meaningful moment to me.
Dialogue||Meaningful in what way?
Dialogue||What's a "cloud meditation?"
Dialogue||How to explain... From that high up, I can see farther than anybody. I could even see the Sun Dragon Elios on his mountaintop. But out of all that, I saw you on your farm.
Dialogue||You and your farm were so small compared to everything, but you're still all I wanted to look at.
Dialogue||That's a style of meditation I invented! It's just what it sounds like - you settle on a cloud in the sky and meditate. It takes a lot of experience using wind magic, of course.
Dialogue||I'm lucky to have stolen your attention like that!
Dialogue||You need to practice staying focused.
Dialogue||Be sure, XX, it's nothing to do with luck. You've completely captivated me - even in meditation!
Dialogue||My point was that I'm focused on <i>you</i>, but I guess you didn't get that.
Dialogue||I'll keep my meditation on the ground for now.
Dialogue||That sounds peaceful.
Dialogue||I suppose it would be difficult for you to share that space with me. You're probably a few decades away from that level of mastery.
Dialogue||It might be the most peaceful space I've found for myself. I wish I could share it with you, but you're probably a few decades away from that level of mastery.
Dialogue||XX, I was just wondering something about you. I don't want to ask anything that might make you uncomfortable, though.
Dialogue||What's on your mind?
Dialogue||Vaan, you can ask me whatever you want, anytime.
Dialogue||Well, it's a couple things... but I was thinking about my connection to magic. It seems to be... louder than usual, if that makes sense.
Dialogue||I know that. I'm a little astonished with you, XX. I can already tell that you're an important person in my life. Someone who will change me, for the better.
Dialogue||Because of that, I want to give you something. It's my ruby ring.
Dialogue||I don't have much of a connection to magic.
Dialogue||My connection to magic has been getting stronger, too.
Dialogue||Is that true? Hm, that's surprising to hear. I thought someone like you would be attuned to magical energies. Just don't close yourself off to the idea, okay?
Dialogue||Ah, that's interesting. So you think it means I'm getting stronger? You might be right, actually. But it's a very intense feeling. I just don't know what started it.
Dialogue||I noticed it not long after meeting you, actually. I wonder if... Hm, I should talk to Nivara.
Dialogue||Your ruby ring?
Dialogue||Is this important?
Dialogue||Yes, it has great personal value to me. I trust you to take care of it, and it should help keep you safe too. I know you won't lose it, XX.
Dialogue||Grammy told me Sun Haven was a nice town. Once again, she was right!
Dialogue||What made you choose to be a miner?
Dialogue||Grammy?
Dialogue||Mines are where I'm the most comfortable - I'd rather be underground than above ground most of the time. But you can't sell your wares where people can't see you.
Dialogue||Grammy, Grams, Mee-Maw, Grandma! I owe her a lot. She's the one that supported my dream of being a traveling merchant in the first place.
Dialogue||You're like a mole!
Dialogue||You don't ever feel uncomfortable underground?
Dialogue||Haha! That's a good one! I'm definitely a mole.
Dialogue||Not as long as I've got light. It's nice and cozy down there with all the rocks. Rocks are our oldest friends!
Dialogue||Isn't she worried about your safety, traveling so much?
Dialogue||Grammys are the best. Everyone should be close with their "mee-maw."
Dialogue||Oh gosh, do you think I'm worrying her? I should send her a letter.
Dialogue||I agree completely! Our elders need to be cherished.
Dialogue||Hello there! I'm Rex. I know all there is to know about digging underground.
Dialogue||Hi Rex, I'm XX. Did you say, underground?
Dialogue||That's right! I'm a traveling merchant selling all the mining gear you need.
Dialogue||XX, I think you've gotten stronger since we first met. I wonder, is that the farming? Or have you been going on adventures without me?
Dialogue||You go on adventures without me, right?
Dialogue||I can't help it if I'm getting stronger.
Dialogue||Oh, yes. I didn't mean to sound like I was accusing you or anything. It's important to spend time apart, too.
Dialogue||Of course not. I actually think it looks quite good on you. I'm happy to see you taking good care of yourself, that's all.
Dialogue||Do you wish we spent more time together?
Dialogue||Do you think we spend too much time together?
Dialogue||I'm not worried about us, XX. It's good to have some space. Something Nivara once told me is, "the tallest trees of the forest grow not in each other's shadow."
Dialogue||Oh Vaan - still admiring me from afar after all this time?
Dialogue||Will you ever stop watching me from a distance?
Dialogue||I can't help it if I'm enamored by you still. You won my heart at first sight, and every time after that.
Dialogue||Ah! When you point it out like that, it makes it sound bad!
Dialogue||I can't chat for long right now, but I'm glad we officially met, XX.
Dialogue||I'm already so used to seeing you here that I forgot you're not native to Nel'Vari.
Dialogue||If you didn't live in Nel'Vari, where would you want to live?
Dialogue||I'm looking forward to our second date.
Dialogue||That's tough. I don't know many places outside of Nel'Vari and Sun Haven. Although, I have heard of towering peaks in the Northern Region covered in snow.
Dialogue||The wind must blast up those steep cliffs with such force... I can only imagine what I would learn from the wind there.
Dialogue||So you've been thinking about that too? I admit, it's been on my mind. How about tomorrow?
Dialogue||You would freeze.
Dialogue||You're so dedicated to your mastery, Vaan.
Dialogue||That's a risk I'm willing to take if it means further mastering my magic.
Dialogue||Thank you! I'm delighted that you noticed, XX. People don't realize how hard I work for my magic.
Dialogue||Sure, I'd love to!
Dialogue||It's best that we don't, Vaan.
Dialogue||Alright! Meet outside of my house tomorrow night at 5:00 pm. I can't wait to see you there, XX.
Dialogue||No problem, I completely understand. Even if it is disappointing.
Dialogue||You have a thoughtful look on your face, XX. What's on your mind?
Dialogue||I'm thinking about the future.
Dialogue||I see. It has been some time since we've talked about the future. For me, it looks more bright and clear than I would have ever thought.
Dialogue||XX! I'm surprised at you. Of course I'm happy, how could I not be?
Dialogue||Besides, if I was unhappy then I'd be sure to let you know. It... wouldn't be pretty.
Dialogue||Why are you so sure about it?
Dialogue||Has your vision of the future changed?
Dialogue||Oh, I know this is going to sound corny... but there's no avoiding it.
Dialogue||Now that I've got you with me, I see nothing but happiness in my future. I hope you feel the same way, XX.
Dialogue||I was just having doubts.
Dialogue||I was wondering what it would be like if we were together, forever.
Dialogue||That wasn't the direction I thought this conversation was headed... Rest assured, XX, that I will stand by your side any day. If you want me there, I mean.
Dialogue||Are you saying what I think you're saying? XX, it sounds like you're talking about a big step - <i>the</i> big step!
Dialogue||You should know, that I'll stand by your side any day!
Dialogue||I can smell the sea on the wind, even this far into the forest. That means a lucky day!
Dialogue||What are you up to today?
Dialogue||I didn't think you believed in luck.
Dialogue||There's a heavy branch that sticks out of the top of the Grand Tree which makes for a good seat. I was hoping to spend some time up there today.
Dialogue||Well, you know that I think the future is completely in our control. But outside forces have an influence too, even if it's small.
Dialogue||That sounds dangerous.
Dialogue||It's like a separate little world up there. I've been watching a bird's nest that I think is close to hatching, too. I hope to see it when it happens!
Dialogue||Maybe it is, but I've found great clarity in places like that.
Dialogue||What do you mean?
Dialogue||I've had great luck since I moved to Sun Haven.
Dialogue||Let me put it this way - if you work harder, then your farm succeeds. But sometimes it rains, and your farm succeeds without you.
Dialogue||That's a small example of how luck can help us, even when we're firmly in control of our actions.
Dialogue||You took matters into your own hands - chose your own future - and the luck rode in your wake.
Dialogue||You know, I used to visit Sun Haven a lot. Your farm is quite beautiful.
Dialogue||When did you do that?
Dialogue||Why did you visit Sun Haven?
Dialogue||I've always like keeping an eye on things around the forest, but I didn't start visiting the farm until it was abandoned. It was so beautiful when it was overgrown.
Dialogue||In part, it just came from me practicing my magic. I simply needed space to fly, and the sky over Sun Haven is nice and clear.
Dialogue||But then I began paying attention to the people down there. I guess I became sort of infatuated with the town. Human lives are interesting to me.
Dialogue||So you think it's ugly now that I've farmed it?
Dialogue||It did look nice that way.
Dialogue||No no! That's not what I meant at all.
Dialogue||Once again, it seems like we're speaking on different levels.
Dialogue||Ah, but don't misunderstand me. It looks great with you on it - I mean, with the work you've done. You've made it more charming than ever.
Dialogue||What's interesting about it?
Dialogue||Do you get infatuated often?
Dialogue||I can't say exactly. It's so different from Nel'Vari, but the people still seem happy. Anyway, I can't help what interests me. That's just nature, and it's the Elven way not to interfere with nature.
Dialogue||Ah! Heh, XX, you caught me by surprise with that one. I can't help what interests me. That's just nature, and it's the Elven way not to interfere with nature.
Dialogue||Everyone in Nel'Vari has their mind on the forest, but all I can think about lately is you, XX.
Dialogue||It's been a long time since someone new has found their way to us. You must be something special, XX.
Dialogue||Those are interesting tattoos.
Dialogue||And what do you do here, Vaan?
Dialogue||Ah, do you like them? The Elder gives us these tattoos himself. They're meant to represent our individual spirits.
Dialogue||Sometimes they can even start glowing, but only when in a state of deep spiritual activity. I've only seen mine glow once before - the first time I flew on my cloud.
Dialogue||I mostly practice my magic. I've been trying to push my knowledge of wind magic to its limits lately. It's exhausting, to be honest.
Dialogue||Are you less spiritual than other Elves, then?
Dialogue||You must be very spiritual, then.
Dialogue||Hm? Not at all. You must be misunderstanding me, XX. It's a rare thing to see your tattoos glow.
Dialogue||Aside from the Elder, I might even be one of the most spiritual people in Nel'Vari.
Dialogue||Ah! I don't mean to sound like I'm bragging. Sometimes my mouth gets ahead of my brain.
Dialogue||How did you learn magic?
Dialogue||You sound pretty advanced.
Dialogue||I was taught by the World Dragon. No one else has the knowledge to train a master of wind magic.
Dialogue||Of course, I trained under the World Dragon herself. No one else has the knowledge to train a master of wind magic.
Dialogue||One day I'll finish my training, and I know you'll be there with me, XX.
Dialogue||You have a sparkle in your eye that I can't help but stare into.
Dialogue||Ah, another cave-diving enthusiast? Join the club! That's just a saying, there isn't really a club.
Dialogue||Ah, XX! Sorry - I still have some wind up my nose.
Dialogue||Hey XX, I got these for you. Think of them as a thank-you for our date.
Dialogue||What should I do with this?
Dialogue||You're giving me greenroot?
Dialogue||Well, some people like to bake it into a dessert - some kind of peach cobbler, I'm unsure - but I prefer to just eat it raw.
Dialogue||That's right, they're my favorite. But what's the point in loving something if I can't share it?
Dialogue||That sounds rough.
Dialogue||That sounds good!
Dialogue||Oh, do you really think so? Most people are repulsed by the taste of raw greenroot. I'm not surprised that you're the same.
Dialogue||Oh, do you really think so? Most people are repulsed by the taste of raw greenroot. I'm surprised that you're the opposite.
Dialogue||It's okay to enjoy things on your own, Vaan.
Dialogue||I'm happy to share the things you love.
Dialogue||I'm well aware, but I want to share with you right now. But I guess I can't make you do anything you don't want to.
Dialogue||Frankly, I'm glad you enjoy raw greenroot. It's definitely not for everybody!
Dialogue||You're just like one of your crops - started as a seed but grown strong and elegant.
Dialogue||You see me like a plant?
Dialogue||You're unlike anyone I've ever met, Vaan.
Dialogue||Yes! You know, you're really precious when you're watered.
Dialogue||Of course I am, and so are you. I think that's a big reason why we fell for each other, XX. Nobody else fits us.
Dialogue||You're messing with me.
Dialogue||Watered??
Dialogue||That's right, my precious sunflower - haha!
Dialogue||Yes, my precious sunflower.
Dialogue||Haha, I just like pushing your buttons.
Dialogue||Even I don't understand you sometimes.
Dialogue||We're two of a kind.
Dialogue||Is that how you've felt this whole time? Maybe there really isn't a perfect match for me after all.
Dialogue||As long as I have you in my life, XX, I'll feel complete. I would fly anywhere with you.
Dialogue||I've been making strides in my work with Nivara lately. You should spend some time with the World Dragon if you're ever feeling lost, spiritually.
Dialogue||I thought you already mastered your magic?
Dialogue||Are you very spiritual, Vaan?
Dialogue||Sure I have, but Nivara still has plenty to teach. Her wisdom spans farther than just magic, anyway.
Dialogue||I'm talking about spirituality, XX! You must be slightly familiar with the concept.
Dialogue||Heh, you still have a thing or two to learn about Elven society, XX.
Dialogue||Spirituality is part of every Elf's life on some level. It's important for my magic, so I focus on it quite a bit.
Dialogue||Sure I am!
Dialogue||I am not, actually.
Dialogue||Oh yeah? That's great! I've wondered if the Sun Dragon taught similar lessons. It's good knowing that Nivara isn't the only source of wisdom in the world.
Dialogue||Oh, no? I've wondered if the Sun Dragon taught you that kind of stuff along with the usual blessing. I guess not all dragons can dispense wisdom like Nivara.
Dialogue||Spirituality doesn't help me with my magic, though.
Dialogue||That explains why your magic is so strong.
Dialogue||XX, your ignorance is showing. Your spirit comes into play with every use of magic, no matter if you realize it or not.
Dialogue||It's certainly part of the reason, yes. You could probably have a similar experience if you focused more on your own spirituality!
Dialogue||Looking for tools? I'm always open! Erm, except for when I'm closed of course.
Dialogue||It takes someone special to capture my attention, XX. And now you've captured so much more than that!
Dialogue||I don't like to think that I've "captured" you.
Dialogue||You don't feel restricted by our marriage?
Dialogue||I only meant it as an expression, but I see your point. Maybe a better word is "won."
Dialogue||Oh, but does that make me sound like too much of a prize?
Dialogue||I might, if it were with anyone else. But you've always encouraged my freedom, XX. More than that, you've inspired me to thrive in it.
Dialogue||Heh, sorry if I'm getting too serious. I get carried away with you!
Dialogue||A prize is exactly what you are!
Dialogue||We could always just say, "married!"
Dialogue||Ah! XX, you're such a jokester! I'm going to get smile lines because of you.
Dialogue||I guess that's easiest, huh? Heh, with how much you make me smile, XX, I see smile lines in my future.
Dialogue||You can get a little intense sometimes.
Dialogue||I like it when you get carried away.
Dialogue||Apologies, XX. I didn't know it bothered you. I always thought you could handle my spirit, but I suppose I was wrong.
Dialogue||And you manage to build my spirit up even more! I'm lucky to have found someone exactly as passionate as me.
Dialogue||It's my dream to explore every cave in the world!
Dialogue||I'd usually love to chat, but I have to fly. We'll talk soon, I promise.
Dialogue||Have you met Iris yet? She was a big help with getting my house set up.
Dialogue||Why is your house so far away from everyone else?
Dialogue||Is she a good friend of yours?
Dialogue||I like it that way. It's a little quieter, a little more my own. It's important for me to have control of my own space.
Dialogue||Iris? Sure, we've known each other for many years. Without Iris, many of the buildings in town wouldn't have been possible to build - like my house.
Dialogue||She's the second strongest magic user in Nel'Vari - other than me, of course.
Dialogue||That sounds a little isolated.
Dialogue||That kind of solitude does sound peaceful.
Dialogue||It is, but that's the point. Maybe you don't share the same appreciation for solitude that I do.
Dialogue||That certainly factors in. The peace and quiet have allowed me time to meditate and focus on myself.
Dialogue||You say you're stronger?
Dialogue||You said she helped build your house?
Dialogue||I only say that because I've mastered my practice. She's still learning the secrets of enchanting magic, I believe.
Dialogue||Maybe "build" isn't the right word. I had a vision of a home inside the trunk of a great tree, and she engineered it with her enchanting magic.
Dialogue||My wares are held at a high standard and a fair price. What more can you want?
Dialogue||Familiarity is the best teacher. I recommend a weapon you have experience with.
Dialogue||Can you believe that some people have never set foot underground? Honest!
Dialogue||I was soaring over the forest when I heard some delightful music. It was coming from that big house by the wheat field in Sun Haven. Do you know the one?
Dialogue||Do you like that kind of music?
Dialogue||That's Claude's house.
Dialogue||It was very unlike Elven music, for sure. But it was calming. A very pleasant surprise to find in the clouds above the forest!
Dialogue||Claude? Is he the broody one with the blonde hair? I think I've seen him before. I wouldn't have taken him for a musician.
Dialogue||I don't like that kind of music.
Dialogue||I can't imagine a better place to listen to music.
Dialogue||Oh? You must prefer loud music. Too much noise makes it difficult to meditate, but to each their own.
Dialogue||It really was a perfect moment, even if it was just a moment.
Dialogue||Why not?
Dialogue||"Broody" is one way to describe him.
Dialogue||Most of the musicians I know are mushrooms... But besides that, he doesn't look very happy.
Dialogue||In Nel'Vari, the best crafters are the happiest ones. You can feel their happiness in their work. To create from a place of sadness sounds wrong to me, but maybe it's just a Human thing.
Dialogue||I don't mean to judge him harshly. I've just never seen a smile on his face, I don't think.
Dialogue||Can you imagine, never smiling? That would be so sad, and boring!
Dialogue||You're the most graceful creature in the whole forest.
Dialogue||This is a nice little town, I think I'll make it a regular stop.
Dialogue||I love hearing my name come out of your mouth.
Dialogue||Good day, adventurer. Find yourself wanting for protection? One look in my cart can solve that.
Dialogue||Can I ask you about your eye?
Dialogue||Do you ever sell your weapons to the army?
Dialogue||Go on kid, just ask your question.
Dialogue||The army? My weaponry would be wasted on their training dummies. The blades would dull long before they saw combat.
Dialogue||My goods should be used by real fighters, not pansies running routines.
Dialogue||How did you lose it?
Dialogue||Actually, I feel like I'm being rude now...
Dialogue||When I was younger than you are now, I went looking in a crystal ball to see my future.
Dialogue||Well, the ball turned out to be cursed. Held me captive and glowed so bright that it burned blindness into my eye. So, there you go.
Dialogue||I can tell you more about it another time. I've got lots to tell, you know. If you have a spot of free time, why don't you come by for a tale?
Dialogue||I figured you wouldn't have the guts to ask. I'm having a good day, so I'll tell you anyway.
Dialogue||Well, the ball turned out to be cursed, flashed so bright that it burned blindness into my eye.
Dialogue||You're right, soldiers really don't know what they're doing.
Dialogue||Soldiers are real fighters.
Dialogue||Truer words have never been spoken.
Dialogue||Soldiers fight because they're told to. A warrior fights because the fight is in their blood. Not that you'd know anything about that.
Dialogue||Don't just stand there gawking. Either you're buying or you're leaving.
Dialogue||I'm the only Elf in Nel'Vari to venture out so often. I just can't stay put when the wind is blowing.
Dialogue||Nice day today. Are you going into the forest? You should be prepared.
Dialogue||Where do you get your weapons?
Dialogue||Have you ever been caught unprepared before?
Dialogue||I'm a traveling merchant, so I know how to spot quality. Whenever I see some good iron on the road, I barter for it. That's real trade, kid.
Dialogue||I've been in an ambush once before, but I've always got something sharp on me. Really, those bandits caught themselves unprepared!
Dialogue||What if you get scammed?
Dialogue||How long have you been doing this?
Dialogue||Sure, that's happened once or twice. What happens is I learn from it and try not to let it happen again.
Dialogue||And if I happen to find the person who scammed me, then I'll give them a conversation they won't likely forget.
Dialogue||I can't say exactly, but I can tell you that my hair was black when I started!
Dialogue||Your job sounds dangerous.
Dialogue||It sounds like you can really handle yourself.
Dialogue||Might be, yeah. That's why it's not for whiners to do. You might stick with farming, kid.
Dialogue||I spend all day around these weapons, don't you think I play with them a bit?
Dialogue||My dearest XX! I was just thinking about you, and about our future.
Dialogue||Our future? What were you thinking?
Dialogue||What goals do you want to accomplish in the future?
Dialogue||I'm not sure! There are so many possibilities, XX. I'm just glad we're finally together. Suddenly the future is a bright, branching river - and we get to choose where we go.
Dialogue||Since I've learned all I can about wind magic from Nivara, I would love to find a new source of instruction. I know there's more knowledge out there, I just don't know where.
Dialogue||The future is completely in our control.
Dialogue||I don't think we get to choose our futures.
Dialogue||I feel exactly the same way. XX, I'm constantly amazed at you. I always knew we were a perfect match.
Dialogue||Every part of me disagrees, XX. But that's okay, you'll see when the time comes.
Dialogue||Be patient, I'm sure you'll something will come to you.
Dialogue||Keep looking. You won't find it if you don't look.
Dialogue||You're right. I just need to keep myself open to all possibilities.
Dialogue||Oh, it's you XX. This is fairly bad timing, I'm pretty busy right now.
Dialogue||Looking to broaden your horizons? Follow your gut.
Dialogue||Lately I feel like I've been floating on air - even when I'm not!
Dialogue||You're a good farmer, XX. I'm happy to see the old farm in your hands.
Dialogue||So many developments in Sun Haven lately! The little city is really getting its groove back, it seems. I'd love to check it out more, if the guards weren't so aggressive!
Dialogue||Why do the guards in Sun Haven hate you so much?
Dialogue||What's the biggest change to Sun Haven you've seen?
Dialogue||Well they don't have anything against the Elven race in general, they just don't like that I won't "identify myself" in a "proper way", or whatever.
Dialogue||Maybe I would, if they'd stop shooting at me everytime I fly near! And that guard with the big sword! Who taught her to talk the way she does? Yeesh!
Dialogue||That's the problem with society. Either you follow all their rules, or you're good for nothing. And everyone wonders why I'm always bouncing around from place to place.
Dialogue||Well, that's pretty easy. Your farm is probably the number one thing, but it isn't just that. It's as if the whole town seems busier than it has before, more bustling.
Dialogue||If Sun Haven was a dwindling breeze before, it's a lively gale now.
Dialogue||Maybe you should just follow the rules.
Dialogue||They shouldn't see you as such a threat.
Dialogue||Ugh, after the way they've been jerks to me? Not a chance.
Dialogue||Right?! That's what I've been trying to tell them! Maybe it's too late now, though. They seem to hate me pretty good, so perhaps I'll never be able to freely enjoy Sun Haven.
Dialogue||It must be interesting, seeing it all happen from above.
Dialogue||I wish I could see the town grow from the sky.
Dialogue||It is. A bird's eye view is usually my preferred way of seeing things, but I'd love to check Sun Haven out from the ground more, though.
Dialogue||It is a sight to be savored, that's for sure. Ah, how unfortunate that everyone can not be as skilled as myself! I'd love to check Sun Haven out from the ground more, though.
Dialogue||I know you're busy, but you could use a clean change of clothes.
Dialogue||XX! I'm glad to see you. I had a... rough morning.
Dialogue||How do you usually wind down from a rough day?
Dialogue||I got caught in Sun Haven earlier this morning - apparently the guards are on high alert.
Dialogue||That guard with the really big sword was NOT happy to see me sitting on top of the town hall.
Dialogue||I love to snack on some greenroot, for starters. Then I usually just escape on my own into the trees. There's nowhere as peaceful as a quiet branch in the middle of the forest.
Dialogue||Did you get hurt?
Dialogue||You let yourself get caught?
Dialogue||No, I'm fine. Arrows are easy to dodge when you're above them. Thank you for worrying, though.
Dialogue||I guess I need to be a little more discreet when I visit your town, huh?
Dialogue||It's not that simple. That guard has eyes like a hawk. I swear, nobody else has ever seen me until her. I don't think I'm to blame here.
Dialogue||Do you always deal with your feelings alone?
Dialogue||You can spend time with me, if you need a friend.
Dialogue||I've never thought much about it. But yes, I often seek solitude when I need to process my thoughts. It's how I've always been.
Dialogue||That's... very sweet, XX. I usually seek solitude when I need to process my thoughts. It's nothing against you, it's just how I've always been. But I'm glad to know you're here.
Dialogue||People always tell me I'm so high up in the clouds. Sometimes I feel that they're right.
Dialogue||Keep your head up, maybe you'll see me again soon.
Dialogue||Hey XX, I'm happy to see you.
Dialogue||I've actually been meaning to ask you... I was thinking we could go visit your farm together. What do you think?
Dialogue||I didn't know you liked my farm so much.
Dialogue||What if we had a date right here in Nel'Vari?
Dialogue||Didn't I mention before that it's beautiful? You've really done well with it.
Dialogue||I used to sit on a hill nearby to think about all the future possibilities. I know it sounds a little vague, but I guess it's like... reflecting on the future, if that makes sense?
Dialogue||Oh! A - a date? You really mean it? That... that would be fine with me, XX!
Dialogue||What do you reflect on?
Dialogue||I don't quite understand.
Dialogue||I reflect on lots of things. Simply put, the things I'll do, and the things I won't do. I'm captivated by the idea of having opportunities.
Dialogue||It's the idea that I can pick and choose from any future - just reach out and grab it if I want to. Knowing I have this capability feels almost more powerful than my wind magic.
Dialogue||Actually, I'm having second thoughts.
Dialogue||Of course I meant it! When should we go?
Dialogue||That's okay. I guess I can wait. But I won't wait forever, XX.
Dialogue||Meet me outside of my house and we'll go together. Let's say, tomorrow at 12:00 pm. I already can't wait!
Dialogue||There's a reflection of me in your eye... it's perfect.
Dialogue||Hello again! Spare time for a chat?
Dialogue||Have you been to the caves around here?
Dialogue||What do you do when you're not underground?
Dialogue||Oh, of course. They're fantastic, full of useful ore and beautiful rock formations.
Dialogue||I haven't had the chance to get all the way through them, but that's my first goal before I move on to the next town.
Dialogue||For fun, I like to relax in whatever tavern is nearest. Taverns, pubs, watering holes - these places keep me from getting lonely on the road.
Dialogue||All the way to the bottom? Is that possible?
Dialogue||You take this really seriously!
Dialogue||Of course! I like to say, anything is possible with perseverance and rations. It helps me remember to pack enough food.
Dialogue||Of course! I can't claim to be the best miner in the world without conquering every mine. For now I just say I'm "almost" the best miner in the world, but that doesn't sound as impressive.
Dialogue||You're a nice guy. I bet you make lots of friends!
Dialogue||Nobody makes real friends in a tavern.
Dialogue||That's mighty nice of you to say! Sometimes it's less about making friends and just about being around people.
Dialogue||Too much time underground and sometimes I forget there's a whole world up here!
Dialogue||Maybe not with that attitude.
Dialogue||Even if they're just your pal for a night, it's nice to make conversation - even with strangers.
Dialogue||My name means "king." I don't think a lot of kings spend their time in the mines, though.
Dialogue||Hey XX, are you liking Nel'Vari? I hope you are.
Dialogue||It's gorgeous here.
Dialogue||Have you been to visit Nivara?
Dialogue||You think so, too? I'm glad. You really do deserve to be here. After all, not just anyone could find their way to our home.
Dialogue||Of course I have. When Elves come of age, they go to receive her blessing. For me, her blessing revealed my abilities with wind magic, for which I'm endlessly grateful.
Dialogue||Getting here was too easy, you should get more security.
Dialogue||Thank you for being so welcoming to me, Vaan.
Dialogue||Well, XX, that's because it isn't meant to be <i>impossible</i>  to find our city, only selective.
Dialogue||Of course. You being here only adds to Nel'Vari's charm. Really, I mean that.
Dialogue||Do you think Nivara will give me a blessing?
Dialogue||So Nivara's blessing gave you your magic, just like Elios.
Dialogue||I'm sure I don't know. Nivara will make that judgement when she meets you.
Dialogue||Just be yourself, XX, and Nivara will see you the same way that I do... I'm certain you will be found worthy.
Dialogue||You're mistaken. A dragon's blessing doesn't give you magic. The blessing reveals your true self.
Dialogue||There's nothing like the thrill of entering a cavern for the first time.
Dialogue||I spoke with Nivara today. It was the first time in a long while.
Dialogue||You haven't been speaking to her as much?
Dialogue||What did you talk about?
Dialogue||No, I haven't. I actually didn't realize how long it's been since our last conversation. Do you think that's a bad thing?
Dialogue||She said that my spirit feels stronger than the last time we met. Before I could even respond to that, she said she could feel an abundance of love in my energy.
Dialogue||According to Nivara, knowing love is crucial to spiritual freedom. I'm still exploring that idea.
Dialogue||Isn't that like skipping school?
Dialogue||Don't you think she still has much to teach?
Dialogue||She certainly has a few lessons left for me, probably more than I realize. You're right, XX. I'll make a better effort to see her more often.
Dialogue||Let me know if you need any help testing that idea!
Dialogue||Do you really think she could sense that?
Dialogue||Heh, oh XX. I'm already getting all the "help" I need from you.
Dialogue||I should thank you, actually. I didn't realize it, but you've accelerated my spiritual growth here. And just by being yourself! You're truly remarkable, XX.
Dialogue||Of course, XX. It's not our place to doubt the guardian dragons, especially not Nivara. I'm sure you wouldn't cast doubt on Elios.
Dialogue||It's no surprise that the partner of my dreams would come from Sun Haven.
Dialogue||I was just thinking the other day, XX. You and I are like kindred flames!
Dialogue||What's a kindred flame?
Dialogue||What do you mean we're 'kindred flames'?
Dialogue||Ah, you know. Like "peas in a pod" or "cut from the same cloth"? In Nel'Vari we usually say "kindred flame", though I've always thought I'm more of a 'breeze' than a 'flame'.
Dialogue||You go all over the place. Nel'Vari, Sun Haven. I'm pretty sure I've spotted you going towards Withergate, even! And you grew up in the Great City.
Dialogue||I never want to stay in one place for very long, either. There's just so much world to be seen, and people like us gotta get out and see it!
Dialogue||What a neat saying.
Dialogue||Nel'Vari lingo can be kind of dramatic.
Dialogue||Yes, the words of Nel'Vari can certainly be pretty eloquent. I like the stuff they say in Sun Haven, though. More rustic and to the point.
Dialogue||I know, right? The words of Nel'Vari can certainly be pretty eloquent. I like the stuff they say in Sun Haven, though. More rustic and to the point.
Dialogue||The world was made to be explored.
Dialogue||I travel so I can earn a living, though.
Dialogue||Well said! And might I add, it's so commemorable that you do it all without even being able to fly!
Dialogue||Well, sure. But come on, now. Are you telling me you don't enjoy the adventure of it...?
Dialogue||If you're going out into the wilds, you'll want some protection - trust me.
Dialogue||Guess what, XX? I figured out a new wind magic technique! Watch... actually, I'm nervous now that you're watching.
Dialogue||Why hello there. How do you do?
Dialogue||Hello, I'm XX. Pleasure meeting you.
Dialogue||Thanks, I'm Caspian. Charmed.
Dialogue||Try not to get too comfortable here.
Dialogue||Hop, hop! What brings you to Withergate, weirdo? Hehe, don't get upset. I'm a weirdo, too!
Dialogue||I'm XX. I'm a farmer, from the town of Sun Haven.
Dialogue||You must be crazy to come to a place like Withergate! It's a fun place, though, don't you think? Hehe.
Dialogue||I'm trying to choose between crossbows and swords. I have terrible aim, but swords are so heavy...
Dialogue||My seeds only grow in the dark, you know.
Dialogue||This darkness reminds me of when my family lived underground. Sometimes I miss that life.
Dialogue||Hello... Are you here to visit me?
Dialogue||Sure! My name is XX.
Dialogue||XX... Good to meet you. My name is Caspera. My mom says I'm the youngest kid to ever be invited to the Demon King's castle!
Dialogue||You cool? I'm cool.
Dialogue||Have you heard about the monster city? Don't worry, the army will always protect Sun Haven.
Dialogue||Magic doesn't make any sense to me yet. But it will!
Dialogue||The secrets of brewing go deeper and darker than you could imagine...
Dialogue||Are you just visiting, or are you going to look at our wares?
Dialogue||Assisting the Elder is gratifying work, but I enjoy the view most of all. All of Nel'Vari is below us, but the forest runs out to the horizon.
Dialogue||Isn't there something important for you to be doing right now?
Dialogue||Is there anything better than hot coffee to wake you up?
Dialogue||My echo is way too high pitched for someone like you to ever hear, so don't worry about it!
Dialogue||Weather like this always puts a nice sheen on my skin.
Dialogue||Hop, hop! So many lights in Withergate, hehe. Isn't it pretty?
Dialogue||Gotta love the atmosphere in this place.
Dialogue||As the top strategist for King Minos, it's my job to secure Withergate's future.
Dialogue||By now, I think of Sun Haven as my home away from home.
Dialogue||You seem to really care about this town.
Dialogue||Have you heard rumors of a monster town?
Dialogue||I'm here to protect Sun Haven, so I have to care about it. Sometimes I even pretend to switch lives with people to try and understand them better.
Dialogue||That might sound kooky, but it helps.
Dialogue||Withergate? Of course! Who hasn't?
Dialogue||That's a little weird.
Dialogue||That's really thoughtful.
Dialogue||Fine, call me a little weird then.
Dialogue||I think so too. Plus, it keeps me entertained! For the record, Solon's life is the most fun.
Dialogue||Are you worried?
Dialogue||You don't sound worried.
Dialogue||I guess I'm a little worried. Or maybe I'm just wary. Either way, I'm glad I have the training to deal with any possible attacks.
Dialogue||If I panic, then how can I expect the civilians to stay calm? I have to lead by example, just like Nathaniel says.
Dialogue||The dirt seems extra fertile as of late. I wonder why that is.
Dialogue||Are you a plant Amari?
Dialogue||So do you eat food, or what?
Dialogue||That's right, why do you ask? Haven't you met one of us before? There are several in this town alone, you know.
Dialogue||I do not eat, but I make my own energy from sunshine. It makes life a lot more manageable. So much free time that would have been, well, "eaten up."
Dialogue||I didn't mean to gawk.
Dialogue||I've never seen someone like you before.
Dialogue||I simply thought that, since you found your way to Nel'Vari in the first place, you would have been a well-traveled adventurer. You still have a lot to learn, it seems.
Dialogue||That's surprising. I thought that, since you found your way to Nel'Vari in the first place, you would have been a well-traveled adventurer. You still have a lot to learn, it seems.
Dialogue||You make your own food <i>and</i> you tell jokes?
Dialogue||That's the funniest joke I ever heard a plant make!
Dialogue||I suppose all that extra time lets my mind wander. I'm bound to stumble on a joke here or there.
Dialogue||Please, don't insult my intelligence. Plants are mindless beings. I am Amari, not plant.
Dialogue||Eh?! Oh, sorry, didn't hear you there for a second, kekeke.
Dialogue||You must be getting tired by duskfall. For me, I'm just waking up.
Dialogue||The birds in my hair sing such sweet songs...
Dialogue||You? I suppose we were never properly introduced...
Dialogue||Right. So, I'm XX.
Dialogue||My name is Cordelia. I sit on the royal council with Xyla and Darius. I would say it's a pleasure...
Dialogue||Lookin' for love, or just lovin' to look?
Dialogue||Hm? Oh, what do you want?
Dialogue||I just wanted to introduce myself. I'm XX.
Dialogue||Interesting name. My name is Felix.
Dialogue||Eh? New to these docks, ain't ya? I never seen you before, at least.
Dialogue||I'm Sun Haven's new farmer, XX. Nice to meet you.
Dialogue||Ah, farmer is it? Good to meet you, too. I'm Rupert, and I fish. You can fish, too. Plenty of fish to go around, but you won't catch near as many as me, eheh.
Dialogue||Come on over, friend. Take a look.
Dialogue||Can't you feel the vibration of my wings? It feels so good to be buzzing!
Dialogue||What brought you to Nel'Vari?
Dialogue||Last we spoke, you said that you pollinate?
Dialogue||Oh, I was just minding my own business one day, making sure all my bees were hard at work, when I had a vision! That took me by surprise, let me tell ya.
Dialogue||In the vision, I saw a dragon draped with flowers and vines. Turns out, Nivara was calling me directly! She was looking for help keeping the plants healthy around here. Of course, I happily offered my help.
Dialogue||Elves are hard workers, but nobody works as hard as a bee!
Dialogue||That's right! Hold on now... judging by your face, I'd guess you don't even know what that means!
Dialogue||Wow, you're really without a clue, aren't ya? Don't worry honey, Beeanca will help you.
Dialogue||You must be a great help if Nivara called you herself!
Dialogue||So all you do is work?
Dialogue||Not everyone likes to work so much, but me and my bees get such satisfaction from a job well done. Just look around you! All these healthy plants - most of them are here because of me and my bees!
Dialogue||Well don't say that like it's a <i>bad</i> thing! Not everyone likes to work so much, but me and my bees get such satisfaction from a job well done.
Dialogue||Just look at all these healthy plants around you - most of them are here because of me and my bees!
Dialogue||So are you going to tell me?
Dialogue||I don't really care anymore.
Dialogue||Everyone knows that bees make the world go 'round! We keep all the plants growing by spreading our pollen around.
Dialogue||You really didn't know that? Where have you <i>beeeen?</i>
Dialogue||Well fine then, excuse me for taking time out of my day trying to educate <i>you</i> and improve <i>your</i> life.
Dialogue||This permanent darkness... I'm still not quite used to that.
Dialogue||Whenever I get a little homesick for my village, I think of all of the things I love about Withergate. Like the music!
Dialogue||I could go for a juicy grub right now.
Dialogue||You're back... How do you do?
Dialogue||Your glow is really pretty.
Dialogue||Caspera, how long have you been in Withergate?
Dialogue||Oh, do you think? That's a nice thing to say... You're a nice person, aren't you?
Dialogue||I don't know... The last thing I remember, I was visiting the castle... and now there's a whole city here.
Dialogue||It depends who's asking.
Dialogue||I hope so!
Dialogue||Who? Why, I can't remember...
Dialogue||Oh yes, nice indeed. If you need some company, you're welcome to speak with me... anytime.
Dialogue||You don't remember anything else?
Dialogue||I don't think I understand.
Dialogue||Well, I was playing on the bridge to the castle... I remember that I fell, and it was so warm. Then I woke up like this... and that's it.
Dialogue||Some people get real poetic about their fishin'. For me, it's just rod in the water, pullin' up a catch. Don't need to be more than that, I think.
Dialogue||I'm the youngest of my sisters! My name is Sable. Who are you??
Dialogue||I'm XX, a farmer from Sun Haven.
Dialogue||Ooh, you travel? That's fun! I traveled here with my sisters. But I think we're done travelling for now.
Dialogue||Once I perfect my ale recipe, I can return home as a hero! Or a celebrity, at least.
Dialogue||Next drink's on me. It's also <i>for</i> me!
Dialogue||You want to see what's under my scarf? No way!
Dialogue||I think I'll do fruit for dinner tonight. Or maybe mushrooms. Eh, why not both?
Dialogue||Lynn has a lot of raw talent, but talent is worthless without discipline.
Dialogue||Oh, hello there. I'm Sophie, glad to make your acquaintance.
Dialogue||Hi Sophie, I'm XX.
Dialogue||Ooh, you're the farmer. That must be nice, growing crops for a living.
Dialogue||Welcome, friend. Whether you're here for a drink or just some friendly company, I'm happy to have you.
Dialogue||Thanks! My name is XX.
Dialogue||Perfect, I'm Slate. Happy to have you in my tavern.
Dialogue||My grains are germinating as we speak!
Dialogue||Hi, I'm Billie! I just started working at the new salon. You should stop by!
Dialogue||I'm XX. It's nice to meet you.
Dialogue||You too, XX. I'm sure you're busy, so I won't keep you.
Dialogue||People here say I dress funny. It isn't so funny where I'm from, which is too bad! I wish I really did dress funny!
Dialogue||Have you been fishing around Nel'Vari? You might not recognize the fish around here!
Dialogue||Emmett? No, I'm <i>Flemmett</i>.
Dialogue||Withergate is the perfect place for my business. I guess you could say I've put down roots here!
Dialogue||Farmers should be respected.
Dialogue||It isn't how high you can hop, but how far! Hehe.
Dialogue||It's our secret, okay? I'm trusting you!
Dialogue||Smell that? Berries are in season!
Dialogue||*sniff* Don't worry, I'm not contagious. It's just allergies - this town is full of pollen.
Dialogue||I heard you're running the farm across the river. That sounds like fun work!
Dialogue||Do you have fun as a guard?
Dialogue||What do you do when you're not in uniform?
Dialogue||I wouldn't quite say that. Don't get me wrong, it's not bad or anything. The work is more about protection than having fun.
Dialogue||I like to think of myself as an amateur inventor. I once used an old wagon wheel to make a machine that sharpens your sword for you. I love turning problems into projects!
Dialogue||Wouldn't you rather do something you enjoy?
Dialogue||Thank you for the work you do, even though it's not that fun.
Dialogue||You misunderstand me, farmer. I do enjoy this work, just not the same way that I enjoy... oh, I don't know - ice cream.
Dialogue||It's not always so serious. Plus, the rest of the soldiers are a ton of fun. It gets pretty rowdy in the barracks after hours!
Dialogue||What is your best invention?
Dialogue||That's so creative!
Dialogue||Right now, my favorite is the scratcher I made. It's basically just a stick, but it's perfect for reaching any itch when you're wearing your armor.
Dialogue||A lot of the time I'm just bunked up in the barracks, so there's plenty of time to get creative. In a way, boredom breeds creativity.
Dialogue||Giuseppe told me that! Have you met him yet?
Dialogue||So what, you have a question for me or something?
Dialogue||Are you Amari?
Dialogue||Why are you wearing pots?
Dialogue||Last I checked, yeah. What, don't I look it?
Dialogue||What's wrong with it? Maybe it's no good as real armor, but I don't need any real armor here.
Dialogue||You don't seem like the others.
Dialogue||You haven't been here long, have you?
Dialogue||Aw, I'm still not talking right huh? Wesley told me my tone of voice is too rough for this place. I get that it's a nice town and all, but people gotta let people be themselves.
Dialogue||Actually, I used to live in a place called Withergate. Then I got lost and ended up in the forest near here where Rel'Tar picked me up. I was surprised to see Amari and Elves living so nicely with each other, so I just had to stay!
Dialogue||At least you like it.
Dialogue||It looks weird.
Dialogue||I like it plenty. One of the Elves said it suits me, so I stuck with it. Maybe that's a weak argument, but it's not every day I get a compliment like that.
Dialogue||Well I like it plenty. One of the Elves said it suits me, so I stuck with it. Maybe that's a weak argument, but it's not every day I get a compliment like that.
Dialogue||I was shriveled all the time when I lived in Withergate.
Dialogue||I need to work with Xyla to increase security...
Dialogue||Is it boring working on a farm? It must be more fun than standing in one spot all day.
Dialogue||You're the most bored person I've ever met.
Dialogue||Running a farm is a lot of work.
Dialogue||Oh yeah? That's kind of a compliment. Kind of.
Dialogue||I'm up for a challenge. What do you say, need a farmhand?
Dialogue||I don't see how it's a compliment.
Dialogue||You're a strange one, Calvin.
Dialogue||Well I've never been the "most" anything before. At this point, I'll take what I can get.
Dialogue||Strange times make strange people. Isn't that the saying?
Dialogue||I'll let you know if I do.
Dialogue||Definitely not.
Dialogue||Really? I was just joking, but if you offered me a job I might actually be tempted to take it.
Dialogue||You could just say "no."
Dialogue||Come on by if you need some armor or weapons - nobody makes 'em like I do.
Dialogue||Some of my colleagues wish they could go home already, but I'm just glad I have a job.
Dialogue||Demons around here are sooo worried about the size of their horns. I think my little horns are cute!
Dialogue||I'm still working my way up the ladder. Roza's really whipping me into shape.
Dialogue||I wonder if the moon shines as brightly in your Sun Haven as it does here.
Dialogue||I'm not surprised you're back. It isn't every day you meet a master of his craft!
Dialogue||What exactly do you make again?
Dialogue||What brought you to Withergate?
Dialogue||I make beverages of all kinds: drinks, libations, quenchers, and potations too! I've dedicated my whole life to the perfection of brewcraft.
Dialogue||I thought this would be a good spot to sell my brews and maybe learn a thing or two about brewcraft. But to be honest, I was hesitant to come after all I heard about this city.
Dialogue||I nearly turned around before entering Withergate because I wasn't sure what kind of people I would find here. Monsterfolk aren't my usual crowd - me being a regular house cat and all.
Dialogue||Are you working on anything special?
Dialogue||What is the best drink you've made?
Dialogue||But of course! I'm preparing an ale that will be nothing short of perfection. I can already taste it - bittersweet and refreshing...
Dialogue||Nothing motivates me more than the thought of that first, crisp sip of golden ale!
Dialogue||The best drink is the one I've yet to make! I'm preparing an ale that will be nothing short of perfection. I can already taste it - bittersweet, crisp and refreshing...
Dialogue||Every night I dream of that first sip of fizzy golden ale!
Dialogue||I'd say you fit in just fine here.
Dialogue||I don't know if I would call you a "regular" house cat.
Dialogue||You think so, do you? Well that's good, then! I don't want to seem unapproachable to the people here.
Dialogue||What in the world do you mean? Is it the goggles?
Dialogue||Hey XX, is it true that you moved here from the Great City? I bet that place is amazing.
Dialogue||The Great City is nice, if you like cities.
Dialogue||Where are you from, Sophie?
Dialogue||I don't know if I like cities. I've only ever seen regular towns like this.
Dialogue||I came all the way from the north. Well, it was the southern part of the Northern Region, if you follow me.
Dialogue||You're not missing much.
Dialogue||You should try to travel more.
Dialogue||Do you really think that? Hm. I believe you, but I still want to see for myself one day.
Dialogue||That's actually part of what made me join the military, so I could travel more. I guess I didn't expect to be stationed in the same town for five years...
Dialogue||I've heard nice things about the north.
Dialogue||I've heard terrible things about the north.
Dialogue||Like with any place, the north has its good parts and its bad parts.
Dialogue||I'm sure you've heard, but the weather is brutal. On the other hand, I never met someone on the road that was too busy to help when you need it.
Dialogue||My wings carry a lot of weight, but they're also fragile.
Dialogue||Sophie is always training, but she's already one of the most skilled guards in town.
Dialogue||Even though I'm not an Elf, Nel'Vari is the nicest home I've had.
Dialogue||Everything you see here was fashioned by my brother or me.
Dialogue||Hello again! So the Elder must like you, huh? Otherwise you wouldn't still be here. Anyway, I knew he would.
Dialogue||What made you so sure the Elder would like me?
Dialogue||What does the Elder do with people he doesn't like?
Dialogue||I have a sense for these things. Some people call it intuition, some tell me it's a magic sense.
Dialogue||I don't know which is true. I don't really care anyway. All I know is that I can always tell when a person has a kind soul.
Dialogue||I don't think that's ever happened before, not while I've been here anyway. Not a lot of folks find their way in here.
Dialogue||I assume he would he Salix escort the person out of Nel'Vari. He's the big tree guy you saw guarding the entrance.
Dialogue||We don't need much security, but it's nice having him around just in case!
Dialogue||That's a useful skill.
Dialogue||What if I'm secretly evil?
Dialogue||It has certainly helped me out before. In fact, I might've never made it to Nel'Vari without it!
Dialogue||Hah, yeah right - and I secretly have toes!
Dialogue||You could be a guard, too!
Dialogue||It sounds like this place would be completely helpless without him.
Dialogue||What! Me?? Come on, you're pulling my hoof. I know I have a horn, but it's not meant to be a <i>weapon</i>.
Dialogue||You know, you're the only person who ever thought I could be a fighter! That includes myself, heheh.
Dialogue||Don't be so quick to assume, XX. The Elves have their own safeguards in place, and I'm not talking about Salix.
Dialogue||Aren't you so cute!
Dialogue||You remind me of my old friend, Squirrel.
Dialogue||Lester is a joy to talk to. Calvin? Not so much.
Dialogue||It's another peaceful day for Sun Haven. And yet, something ominous is in the air...
Dialogue||Have you ever seen Elven craftsmanship up close? You can really feel the difference. Go ahead, feel it!
Dialogue||May the moon shine on you, XX. Yes, yes, I know - the moon doesn't actually shine, it just reflects the sun.
Dialogue||*Yawn*
Dialogue||I've heard plenty of tales about Sun Haven. You wouldn't believe how much Vaan goes on about it. Or maybe you would, if you've met him.
Dialogue||Sylvia thinks she's the superior woodworker, but I know better.
Dialogue||Eh? Sorry, it's hard to hear in this thing.
Dialogue||I love that the sun is always shining here.	It reminds me to shine, too!
Dialogue||You should spend a night out in the forest sometime. It's a peace and tranquility unlike any other.
Dialogue||The monsterfolk here are endlessly resourceful. I never know what to expect from them.
Dialogue||Remember to care for all things green. For me, that's self-care.
Dialogue||I hope you decide to stay for awhile. You must see Nel'Vari at night!
Dialogue||Sylvius thinks he's the superior woodworker, but I know better.
Dialogue||Ugh, anywhere that Slobert guy walks gets all wet and sticky.
Dialogue||You have to be careful with these seeds. You can't just plant them anywhere, you know.
Dialogue||I consider every Elf here as part of my family.
Dialogue||The dewdrops this morning were <i>delectable!</i>
Dialogue||Take a look, don't be shy!
Dialogue||Aha! Another fan has come to admire my flavorsome beverages!
Dialogue||Um, my name's XX. Who are you?
Dialogue||You - have no idea who I am!?
Dialogue||<b>Ahem.</b>
Dialogue||I am Dr. Hopsan Barley, best brewmaster in all the regions! I'm glad you've made my acquaintance.
Dialogue||Have you ever watched a tree grow up from a sapling? It's beautiful.
Dialogue||Go ahead and browse. Just stop breathing on me please, I'm trying to finish this chapter.
Dialogue||Don't forget to stay hydrated. It's a warm one today.
Dialogue||So what made you join the army in the first place?
Dialogue||You look really strong!
Dialogue||I love physical fitness and pushing myself with new challenges. Oh, and I really love competition.
Dialogue||The army combines all my favorite things into one job!
Dialogue||I do my own extra training every day. I want to hit peak performance so I can impress Roza.
Dialogue||You must be a fierce soldier.
Dialogue||Does all your training come in handy?
Dialogue||Well, I've never actually seen any combat... but I almost always come out on top in sparring practice.
Dialogue||Too much exercise can be a bad thing, you know.
Dialogue||That's some real commitment.
Dialogue||I'm not saying you're wrong, I'm just saying I don't care.
Dialogue||Thanks! It figures that only a farmer would understand my dedication.
Dialogue||Come on! Flex your muscles with me! No? Alright, then!
Dialogue||Tender, one more round!
Dialogue||Don't the taverns in your town use honeycomb?
Dialogue||Hello again, farmer. Are you settling in well? For me it's... in progress.
Dialogue||Pinto, where are you from?
Dialogue||I came down from the Northern Region. I like the weather here way better than there. Still, I miss my friends.
Dialogue||I look young, but I'm old enough to be a recruit. Barely.
Dialogue||You won't last if you're already regretting it.
Dialogue||It was brave of you to make that journey.
Dialogue||Do you think so? Man, maybe you have a point...
Dialogue||Wow, brave? I don't think anyone has called me brave before.
Dialogue||You're new to the army, then?
Dialogue||What made you join?
Dialogue||I'm still in training. It's a lot of fun! But I'm not very good at it yet.
Dialogue||My dad said it would build character. I'm not sure what he means by that, though.
Dialogue||Pull up a rod, but be quiet about it. Don't wanna scare my next catch.
Dialogue||Ah, delicious sunshine!
Dialogue||In my experience I've learned one thing - don't go without a gift!
Dialogue||Hey there, XX. I suppose the nice thing to do would be to wish you a good night.
Dialogue||Me and Dynus run this town. Well, Dynus does. But I'm totally his right-hand dragon.
Dialogue||How many soldiers does it take to keep this place safe, anyway?
Dialogue||There isn't a person in the west that can pull flavor out of coffee beans like me.
Dialogue||Hey, farmer. Your face is looking a little sun-kissed.
Dialogue||What do you do when you're not working the forge?
Dialogue||Have you heard of Withergate?
Dialogue||What's it matter to you?
Dialogue||The monster city, yeah I've heard of it. Haven't seen it though. Can't be sure anyone has.
Dialogue||I was just asking.
Dialogue||I guess it doesn't.
Dialogue||Hm. I walk around Sun Haven, get some clean air in my lungs. Then I go home. Is that what you wanted to know?
Dialogue||Aren't you worried about it?
Dialogue||No sense in worrying, then.
Dialogue||What are you, some kind of sissy? Get your act together.
Dialogue||Yep, that's how I see it. Even if there <i>is</i> a city of monsters out there, they don't seem to care much about us.
Dialogue||I see you eyeballing our baked goods - they taste as good as they look!
Dialogue||Bold choice of colors, I love to see people take risks.
Dialogue||Don't stare too long at my snakes, they get agitated.
Dialogue||When I'm hungry, I go relax under a tree until some fruit falls down.
Dialogue||You know, I could totally beat Prince Darius in a fight. He might be strong, but I've spent years studying the art of combat.
Dialogue||What? Challenge him to a fight? Erm, gotta go...
Dialogue||The most potent magic of all? Romance.
Dialogue||If you think you belong here, you're in for a rude awakening.
Dialogue||Excuse me, I don't mean to be rude, but you're blocking my sun.
Dialogue||Oh, I apologize. I'm XX.
Dialogue||Hello, XX. I'm Reed. No need to apologize, just be mindful. I need plenty of sunlight each day.
Dialogue||Hey, I don't think I've ever seen you before. Great! Someone new to do poses with!
Dialogue||Uh, hey there. I'm XX.
Dialogue||Hey, great name, XX! I'm Arnold. So are you going to do some poses with me, or what?
Dialogue||Oh! You made me jump!
Dialogue||Why are you wearing shoes? Don't you want to feel the grass under your feet?
Dialogue||I've spent a lot of time with the animals around here. That's why I only eat plants - I can't imagine eating any of our forest friends!
Dialogue||I spent my living days hard at work, sweating in the sun and getting my hands dirty.
Dialogue||Keep walkin'.
Dialogue||Sometimes I forget where I am... but it comes back to me sooner or later.
Dialogue||You might think I look scary, but I'm friendly once you get to know me.
Dialogue||It looks like you're enjoying the hospitality of the Elves!
Dialogue||Books are the most important inventions ever made by people. Society couldn't advance without storytelling.
Dialogue||Hey! What's your hurry? Don't you want to dip your hooves in the river?
Dialogue||Would you believe that I was Human once?
Dialogue||Why do you smell like... dirt and Humans?
Dialogue||You know, there are many people in the world who prefer darkness to sunlight.
Dialogue||Nobody knows the soldier's code of conduct better than I do.
Dialogue||Were you talking to me? Sorry friend, I was thinking over a theory on hornsnakes.
Dialogue||What kind of theory?
Dialogue||I hate hornsnakes!
Dialogue||I've been watching wild hornsnakes to figure out what they use their horns for. So far, it's been kind of a bust.
Dialogue||It's my dream to make an encyclopedia of all the animals native to our forest, but that means I have a lot to learn first.
Dialogue||Huh? How can you hate an animal? Especially one as unique as the hornsnake!
Dialogue||If nothing else, they play an important role in the ecosystem. Without them, arcbugs would take over our forest!
Dialogue||That's a noble goal. Knowledge is important to any society.
Dialogue||Maybe you need some help.
Dialogue||Wow, thank you! Some of the Elves think I'm just wasting my time. Apparently, tradition is more important than education to some of my kind.
Dialogue||I can't blame them though. Tradition is how we've survived all these years hidden in the forest.
Dialogue||I appreciate the offer, but I only want my name on this encyclopedia. Maybe that's selfish, but it's <i>my</i> dream.
Dialogue||I don't get it, what do you mean?
Dialogue||I still don't like them.
Dialogue||Hornsnakes and arcbugs compete for territory. Neither of their populations can get too big or they get in each other's way. It's the natural balance at work!
Dialogue||Maybe ecology just isn't for everyone.
Dialogue||Hello. Unless you need something from me, go ahead and grab a book.
Dialogue||Are you from Sun Haven?
Dialogue||How many books have you read?
Dialogue||Yes, I'm a native here. The library was a comfortable place for me when I was a kid. Still is, too.
Dialogue||I don't know. Probably about equal to the number of head injuries you've had.
Dialogue||Was this your dream job as a kid, then?
Dialogue||I don't blame you, libraries are so cozy.
Dialogue||My dream job as a kid was to be a dragon. This was a pretty close second.
Dialogue||And they're usually so quiet too. You know. Usually.
Dialogue||I actually believe that!
Dialogue||You don't have to be rude.
Dialogue||To your credit, you sure know how to take a joke.
Dialogue||And you don't have to distract me.
Dialogue||Careful! If you get too close, I might bite you! Just kidding, hehe. Or am I?!
Dialogue||I think this hairstyle is growing on me...
Dialogue||I can hear your heartbeat - am I making you nervous?
Dialogue||You came from Sun Haven, right? It's a cute name for a town, at least.
Dialogue||I'm sorry, I'm a bit tired right now. I didn't sleep at all last day.
Dialogue||Honeybrew is my own invention. It's honey with a kick!
Dialogue||I was tracking an Amari with military experience, but he disappeared right off the street. He must be a professional.
Dialogue||Come on, don't lie! Who has the better muscles, me or Dwayne?
Dialogue||There's no such thing as being too prepared, I say.
Dialogue||Welcome in, farmer. Make yourself comfortable.
Dialogue||Your tavern is so cozy. There's an inn upstairs too?
Dialogue||What's it like running a tavern?
Dialogue||Yep, upstairs too! Where else are weary travelers supposed to put their feet up?
Dialogue||People come in and we take care of them, simple as that. It can be a lot to manage, though. No matter what, our customers always leave full, rested, and happy.
Dialogue||Have you heard any rumors about the monster town?
Dialogue||What kind of travelers do you get?
Dialogue||I've heard rumblings from different folk, especially travelers coming from the north. Hard to make sense of rumors, though.
Dialogue||Folks from all kinds of places. We even get sailors from the Southern Islands sometimes. Sun Haven may have seen better days, but our reputation for trade still draws folks in.
Dialogue||That's a lot of ruckus. Sounds like annoying work.
Dialogue||It must be interesting seeing so many different people.
Dialogue||Maybe, but I've learned to enjoy the job and all that comes with it. Sounds like you might not understand, though.
Dialogue||Oh sure, the people make the job. Hearing travelers' stories is a perk of the work.
Dialogue||Oh hey there! Have we met before? I'm Felicity! Who are you?
Dialogue||Hey there, Felicity. My name is XX.
Dialogue||Oh, are you the outsider from the Human town? I had some trouble when I first moved here, too, but I'm sure you're fitting in great!
Dialogue||I'm surprised you're still here.
Dialogue||You're lucky. Withergate's been a pretty safe place lately. Safe enough for an outsider like you to walk around, anyway. Keep your nose clean and it'll stay that way.
Dialogue||What do you do around here?
Dialogue||Your jacket looks comfy.
Dialogue||You know how Withergate is, the king doesn't like anything to do with Humans.
Dialogue||But if an interested buyer happens to want something from a Human town, how is the king going to know where it came from?
Dialogue||Yeah? You ever been to the clothes shop? Arianella spins a mean thread. Stop by sometime and see what she's got.
Dialogue||Your secret is safe with me.
Dialogue||That sounds fishy.
Dialogue||Thanks for the tight lips, but I didn't tell you any secrets. In fact, just pretend we never talked.
Dialogue||Is that supposed to be a cat joke? Because I'm not meowing, pal.
Dialogue||Are you friends with Arianella?
Dialogue||You sure seem to like Arianella's work.
Dialogue||I got friends here and there. I don't hang with anyone who asks too many questions, though.
Dialogue||What can I say? She's good at what she does. You heard it from me first. Unless one of the guards asks. In that case, forget we ever talked.
Dialogue||Hey, you don't sound familiar. Who are you?!
Dialogue||I'm XX, and I didn't say anything.
Dialogue||No, not the sound of your voice! Can't you tell I'm a bat monster? I use my echo to see things. When I heard my echo off of you, I knew I hadn't heard you before.
Dialogue||My name is Fidget. Maybe I'll hear you around sometime.
Dialogue||Hey, watch where you're going, would you? I already broke my glasses once this week, I don't want to break them again!
Dialogue||They say I'm the best smith in the four regions. Not like I'm going to argue.
Dialogue||Sometimes butterflies land on my horn when I'm napping.
Dialogue||This place has the most scrumptious soil.
Dialogue||I'll be treated like a hero once I get back to the Great City.
Dialogue||Sleep well tonight, XX. Or stay up with us and bathe in the moonlight.
Dialogue||If I'm ever annoying, just tell me to leaf you alone. Get it? Plant joke.
Dialogue||I can't wait until I grow my wings... I'm going to fly to the top of the Grand Tree!
Dialogue||The best part about not having legs? No leg day!
Dialogue||Who knows? One of my gifts could change your life forever.
Dialogue||You again! Well met. Care for a spot of conversation?
Dialogue||Where were you before you came here?
Dialogue||I haven't seen many spirits before.
Dialogue||Before I met my fate in Withergate, I lived in a quaint Human town. Actually, I wasn't even a true knight! I only donned the armor for a journey which turned out to be my last.
Dialogue||I'm not surprised - it's not everywhere we can exist like this. Keeping a spirit form is hard work! Withergate's darkness makes it much easier, however.
Dialogue||Not a real knight? No wonder you ended up here.
Dialogue||You're very jolly considering the circumstances.
Dialogue||I would argue with you, but I may not have much footing to do so.
Dialogue||I've always believed that everything happens for a reason and you can't control all that happens to you. Thinking like that, it's easy to keep high spirits.
Dialogue||Hah! Get it? Spirits!
Dialogue||So what happens if you can't keep your form?
Dialogue||Have you tried keeping your form in another town?
Dialogue||I disappear into the ether forever.
Dialogue||Only joking! Haha, the look on your face! No, I simply can't interact with the world. I've been told that I slip into another plane of existence, but I don't know much about that.
Dialogue||Oh certainly, I've tried. It knocks me on my behind, I can tell you that. Last time I was on a road out in the sunshine, I couldn't hold my shape for more than a minute.
Dialogue||Don't hesitate to ask for help, now.
Dialogue||Lots of work to do today - just like every day!
Dialogue||You! You're the reason I'm a free man. I owe ya!
Dialogue||Some people make their art on canvas or stone, but people wear my art all around town!
Dialogue||I'm happy to answer any questions!
Dialogue||If I stay in one spot too long, I might take root!
Dialogue||Seriously, it's a problem.
Dialogue||Beeanca was a huge help in setting up this tavern.
Dialogue||Some people here aren't very friendly to people who come from Human towns, though I you must know that by now.
Dialogue||Oh, hey there! You can call me Beeanca.
Dialogue||You look like a hard worker. I'm always looking for more workers!
Dialogue||My name is XX. What kind of work do you do?
Dialogue||Are you kidding? I pollinate! One look at me should have told you that, silly child.
Dialogue||Hello stranger! I love talking to strangers.
Dialogue||Er, my name is XX. You should be careful who you talk to.
Dialogue||Huh? Why? I don't get it.
Dialogue||Well, my name is Dew!
Dialogue||*hic*
Dialogue||So you managed to find your way into town after all?
Dialogue||I saw you walking through the fog earlier. I'm Faeyon Tarrin, but you may call me Faeyon.
Dialogue||Good to meet you Faeyon. I'm XX.
Dialogue||XX, welcome to Withergate. This city is an oddity, as you'll see. I'm curious to know how you'll get along here.
Dialogue||If you want some tips from an expert archer, let me know.
Dialogue||Whatever you need, I'll be sure to take care of ya.
Dialogue||Having a good day? That's great, please do it quietly.
Dialogue||Keep up the good work, friend!
Dialogue||Hey new neighbor, I want you to know that I've got your back!
Dialogue||Do you always carry a bow with you?
Dialogue||What do you do here, Raimi?
Dialogue||Of course! I have to be prepared, you know. Not everyone in this town knows their way around a weapon, so it will be up to us leaders to protect them in an emergency.
Dialogue||I'm a hunter, so I'm always out in the wilderness. You have to watch your back out there or something nasty might sneak up on you.
Dialogue||What kind of emergency are you expecting?
Dialogue||Don't you think the guards have it under control?
Dialogue||I'm not expecting any one emergency, but I'm prepared for all emergencies.
Dialogue||These guards spend all day lounging in the sunshine. They aren't on my level.
Dialogue||If animals are sneaking up on you, you're probably not a great hunter.
Dialogue||Sounds tricky, you must be very skilled.
Dialogue||Whoa, unexpectedly harsh for a farmer.
Dialogue||You're sharp! My skills are unmatched.
Dialogue||Have you met Felix? He's my boyfriend!
Dialogue||You're drawing too much attention to me - act natural!
Dialogue||Only the finest craftsmanship - Elven craftsmanship.
Dialogue||Got some travelers staying with us tonight. Your usual spread - merchants, adventurers, traveling weirdos. You know how it goes!
Dialogue||Pull up a seat, neighbor! Let's have a chat.
Dialogue||So what did you do before the tavern?
Dialogue||When did you learn to cook?
Dialogue||Before this place, I worked construction. Built a lot of houses farther west. It wasn't as fun, but it was good money.
Dialogue||Actually, I taught myself to cook when I was working construction. I used to make lunch for the whole crew!
Dialogue||Eventually I realized I was having way more fun cooking lunch than building houses. The rest is history, as they say.
Dialogue||Wait, does that mean you built this place?
Dialogue||Doesn't this place make good money?
Dialogue||Haha, I wish! I would've done a better job with the seams in the ceiling, I can tell you that much.
Dialogue||No, I didn't get to build this place. Mari and I renovated it together, though.
Dialogue||The tavern pulls in some gold, but we break even more often than not. That's just how it is until business picks up a bit.
Dialogue||It's lucky you were able to pursue your passion.
Dialogue||Do you think you were helping more people in construction?
Dialogue||You're telling me! Who knows where I would be if I'd stuck with construction?
Dialogue||I help plenty of people right here. I don't need to break my back every day to help out.
Dialogue||My sisters don't care about magic at all, but I don't mind because it means I don't have to share my book.
Dialogue||I bet some Elven furnishings would really make your home stand out.
Dialogue||Buzz off...
Dialogue||Only kidding!!
Dialogue||I'm already used to seeing you around here, XX. Anyway, what can I do for you?
Dialogue||What's the best piece of advice you've heard?
Dialogue||Is there anyone in town you don't like?
Dialogue||Best advice ever? Are you in some kind of trouble, XX?
Dialogue||Heh, I'm just joking. The best advice I ever got was to talk to as many people as I can. Making friends can open a lot of doors for you.
Dialogue||I don't want to talk down on anyone, but since you asked... Peter can be a real handful some nights. He'll cause a ruckus if he gets too happy.
Dialogue||I try to talk to everyone I can.
Dialogue||I don't like talking to people much.
Dialogue||A socialite like me, huh? You'll do just fine for yourself here, XX.
Dialogue||No? Then that's how we're different. Talking to people is all I do, all day long!
Dialogue||Have you had any problems with him?
Dialogue||There was one night he broke a stool after he said he could balance it on his head. Yeah, he couldn't.
Dialogue||He came back and paid for the damage the next day, so it was fine in the end.
Dialogue||Ah, so you've spent some time with him already? A man that wears a live crab on his head is bound to be a little rough around the edges, I guess.
Dialogue||I've caught that Angel, Faeyon, looking at me a couple of times. So nosy...
Dialogue||I was just reading about a farmer, then you walked in.
Dialogue||Shoot, where's that book about the handsome wizard?
Dialogue||I'd ask what you do for fun, but I'll guess... reading?
Dialogue||Who do you like to hang out with in Sun Haven?
Dialogue||You're so perceptive, it's amazing the way your brain works.
Dialogue||You're familiar with sarcasm, right? Otherwise, I can direct you to the book that will teach you all about it.
Dialogue||I made friends with Camila shortly after she moved here. You could say we see the world through a similar lens. She has no patience for annoyances, either.
Dialogue||Come on, you don't have any other hobbies?
Dialogue||I shouldn't have asked.
Dialogue||If you must know, I'm learning self-defense from one of the guards at the barracks.
Dialogue||Have you met Allison? She's a good teacher. And she can throw me clear across a room.
Dialogue||You two sound scary...
Dialogue||It must have been nicer for you after she moved here.
Dialogue||You better stop bugging me then, or else the scary ladies will get you.
Dialogue||Sure, it's nice having a like minded friend in town. You must have made some friends by now, right?
Dialogue||It's not that hard in this town. Just start talking to people. Everyone's so keen on making friends here.
Dialogue||You seem like a lively one. I don't think we'll get along too well.
Dialogue||Your feet are surprisingly clean for a farmer.
Dialogue||Welcome! Come to see the world's finest craftsmanship?
Dialogue||What makes this the world's finest?
Dialogue||What a cute deer!
Dialogue||Nobody compares to Elves when it comes to woodcraft, don't you know?
Dialogue||That's Telumbe, he's really smart. He knows the way back home to Nel'Vari by heart.
Dialogue||I'm surprised to see such skill from Elves as young as you.
Dialogue||It's because you live in the forest, right?
Dialogue||Just because we're young doesn't mean we aren't skilled! Why does everyone make that assumption?
Dialogue||Sort of. We have a connection with trees, so we understand the wood better than anyone else.
Dialogue||Can I pet him?
Dialogue||He sounds like a one-of-a-kind animal.
Dialogue||Sorry, I should get back to work and help Sylvius. He will get mad if I leave him alone too long - he's definitely the baby brother.
Dialogue||He really is! Anyway, I should get back to work. Sylvius will get mad if I leave him alone too long - he's definitely the baby brother.
Dialogue||We have to thank the bees for our home. Without them, my honeybrew wouldn't exist!
Dialogue||We could use more of your type in this city.
Dialogue||I'd shake your hand, but I'm a little slimy right now.
Dialogue||One thing that everyone has in common here is that we're all different.
Dialogue||It feels like the forest gets smaller with each passing day.
Dialogue||You really own your look!
Dialogue||Fitting in yet, XX?
Dialogue||I'm only a visitor here.
Dialogue||If it were up to me, Sun Haven would have big walls all around it.
Dialogue||Ever since this Withergate thing cropped up, I've had eyes on the back of my head.
Dialogue||Er, but that's just a saying. I only have the two eyes up front, obviously.
Dialogue||What do you think of the Withergate rumors?
Dialogue||So what made you become a hunter?
Dialogue||They're not just rumors, I've seen the monster city myself. Yeah, huge fiery towers and flying monsters everywhere. We need to be prepared, because a fight is coming.
Dialogue||I guess I started as a teenager. Both my folks had bad joints from working the mines their whole lives, so they couldn't spend long days walking in the forest.
Dialogue||It was up to me to provide when money was tight, so I taught myself how to track and hunt. I got so good at it, I started teaching lessons to bring in some money on the side.
Dialogue||Has anyone else seen it?
Dialogue||Where did you see it?
Dialogue||No, I was alone. Well, I had my friend with me but he was knocked unconscious by a golem. I barely got us out of there alive!
Dialogue||I can't be sure because it was so dark. I wandered alone for two days before I found the road back to Sun Haven.
Dialogue||Your parents were lucky to have you.
Dialogue||You've never had any professional lessons?
Dialogue||Thanks farmer. Not to get a big head about it, but I'm real proud of being a provider! It feels good to give back.
Dialogue||You're not hearing me, farmer - I <i>am</i> the professional in this situation.
Dialogue||I'm in charge of standing here, so you'll have to find your own spot.
Dialogue||Stay sharp, neighbor.
Dialogue||Hop, hop! Hey, be careful not to bump my paper talisman! It's real important, I think! Hehe.
Dialogue||This work isn't glamorous, but it sure is fun.
Dialogue||People tell me my name is fun, but I think it's kind of stuffy.
Dialogue||Hi, I'm Sylvius. My sister and I are the best merchants out of Nel'Vari.
Dialogue||Hi there, my name's XX.
Dialogue||Heh, funny name.
Dialogue||Wait, are you the one who made it here all the way from Sun Haven? Color me impressed!
Dialogue||You've certainly made yourself comfortable here, haven't you? And so quickly.
Dialogue||In the end, nature will outlive us all. Even Nivara believes that.
Dialogue||You don't look like a local. You must be a tourist!
Dialogue||What is this that my Elf eyes see? A stranger, here in Nel'Vari?
Dialogue||Er, that's right. I'm XX, I come from Sun Haven.
Dialogue||Sun Haven? That Human settlement that Vaan is always talking about? Now this is interesting. My name is Luke, since you were kind enough to give me your own.
Dialogue||Truth be told, this armor is a little big on me.
Dialogue||You don't have to pretend you're not interested. Most everyone is.
Dialogue||Come closer, have a chat.
Dialogue||Do you get a lot of attention, then?
Dialogue||I'll admit I've never met somebody like you.
Dialogue||Who, me? Well, <i>of course.</i>
Dialogue||Are you really surprised? Just look at me, darling. I'm one in a million.
Dialogue||I'm a rare breed. There aren't many tiger centaurs in the forest. Heck, I just might be the only one!
Dialogue||With fur like that, I can see why.
Dialogue||Sounds like you're your own biggest fan.
Dialogue||Of course, my fur is a curse as much as a blessing. Sometimes the attention can be too much. I've even been hunted for it.
Dialogue||Oh but don't worry, Nel'Vari keeps me safe! Nivara guided me here herself with some <i>truly wild</i> telepathic power. She said she sensed the danger I was in, and that I could live here safely. And so I have!
Dialogue||That sounds lonely.
Dialogue||That doesn't make you sad?
Dialogue||Actually, I prefer it this way. Now I get all the attention!
Dialogue||If another tiger centaur waltzed in here like some hot new thing, I simply do not know what I would do about it.
Dialogue||It used to, until the Elves here started treating me like royalty. Now every day is a blessing under the World Dragon's protection!
Dialogue||The music has been great lately. Come get on the dance floor sometime!
Dialogue||Hello! Looking for a pick-me-up?
Dialogue||Where do you get your food?
Dialogue||So is coffee your passion?
Dialogue||I actually managed to set up a daily order with the baker, Liam. He's a really talented artisan. And so close! It's quite convenient.
Dialogue||I don't know if my passion is coffee, exactly... But! I do enjoy being hospitable and helping people start their days.
Dialogue||It helps to start your day with a smiling face. I'm more than happy to provide the smile!
Dialogue||I'm glad Liam is getting more business.
Dialogue||You chose a good place to open shop!
Dialogue||He should have plenty of business now that I'm here. I saw he has two little girls with him, too.
Dialogue||Not that I was spying or anything! I'm not <i>that</i> nosy, heh. I just like to know where my money is going.
Dialogue||The opportunity sort of fell into my lap, actually. I was just passing through on my way to the bigger cities farther west, but then I saw the café was available.
Dialogue||And it was so cute! I just had to buy it up. I only hope my investment has a nice return... I hope you drink a lot of coffee!
Dialogue||It's important to start the day on a positive note.
Dialogue||You really think you're making that much of a difference?
Dialogue||That's exactly what keeps me in hospitality work. Interacting with people and helping them in small ways is gratifying work.
Dialogue||As a matter of fact, I do. Anyone who thinks differently can politely hush up!
Dialogue||Supposedly there are a lot of monsters traveling the roads lately. They're all headed to a city called Withergate. Supposedly.
Dialogue||Making coffee is almost like a ceremony in the East.
Dialogue||Quit starin' at me or I'll be the last thing you ever see.
Dialogue||Partake in our goods while you can!
Dialogue||My name's Allison, but my friends call me Allie. What's yours?
Dialogue||I'm XX. Nice meeting you!
Dialogue||Very glad to meet you, XX! It's nice to see fresh faces in this town.
Dialogue||Fashion helped me find myself as a teenager, so now I share that feeling with the world.
Dialogue||It's about time someone took on that old farm. I look forward to having fresh crops in town again.
Dialogue||I'm busy kid, move it or lose it.
Dialogue||My sisters and I followed the moon to Nel'Vari. Then we never left!
Dialogue||Oh it's you, the outsider. It's pretty neat that you're an outsider, actually. I get a lot of my stuff imported.
Dialogue||What kind of stuff do you get imported?
Dialogue||Aren't dragons supposed to be a little more... impressive?
Dialogue||Have you ever heard of <i>Magic Kitty Princess Paradise: Island of Extreme Dreaming and Daring Adventure</i>? Ah, who am I kidding. Of course you haven't.
Dialogue||Anyways, I love collecting statuettes of all the characters. Nowhere around here sells them, though, so I gotta import.
Dialogue||You think every dragon is like the Moon Dragon, or the Sun Dragon? Those are Guardian Dragons! Maybe I'm not Dynus, but tons of people still flock to pay me tribute.
Dialogue||That... sounds interesting.
Dialogue||Sounds dumb.
Dialogue||Oh you have no idea! Come by my place sometime, you can read the first four hundred volumes.
Dialogue||Of course, there's six hundred more volumes after that. Oh, and don't forget the spin-off series!
Dialogue||It isn't dumb!! M.K.P.P.I.E.D.D.A is art! Besides, dragons are natural hoarders. Just look at Dynus!
Dialogue||How many people give you tribute?
Dialogue||I don't think anyone gives you tribute.
Dialogue||Eh, alright, you got me. No one gives me tribute like they do for Dynus. It's not my fault I wasn't born one hundred feet tall!
Dialogue||You're not allergic to pollen, are you?
Dialogue||Withergate must be unlike anything you've ever seen. Yes, I can see it on your face.
Dialogue||Withergate is dazzling... but I'm not sure how I got here.
Dialogue||I've changed some over the years, but the cool sea breeze is always the same.
Dialogue||Feel free to take my minecart into the mines. Just don't forget to bring it back.
Dialogue||If you've eaten any meat at the tavern recently, you can thank me for that.
Dialogue||Hm? Help you with somethin'?
Dialogue||My name's XX, nice to meet you!
Dialogue||Huh? What do I care?
Dialogue||I hope I extinguished the stove...
Dialogue||Who let you into this town, runt?
Dialogue||You're super sweaty - I can smell you with my antennae.
Dialogue||What do you want, shrimp?
Dialogue||Do you have to be rude?
Dialogue||What's your name?
Dialogue||Don't have to be. Wanna be.
Dialogue||What's it to you?
Dialogue||What kind of person wants to be rude?
Dialogue||I can tell you're pretty tough.
Dialogue||The kind I wanna be. Why, what kind of weakling do you wanna be?
Dialogue||Pretty tough? You don't know the half of it, kid.
Dialogue||I was just asking...
Dialogue||I want to get to know you better.
Dialogue||Fine. It's Dwayne. Now you know, so you can go.
Dialogue||Ugh... Sorry pal, not interested.
Dialogue||The intruder. Whatever can I do for you?
Dialogue||Do you like serving the Demon King?
Dialogue||... Is your hair magic?
Dialogue||I'm well-equipped for the position and always ready to take on a challenge. There's no task the Demon King has given me that I couldn't handle yet.
Dialogue||All of me is magic, being that I'm a practitioner of water magic. I understand that my hair is distracting, but you could show a little self-control.
Dialogue||Being good at your job isn't the same as enjoying it.
Dialogue||You must have a brilliant mind for the King to trust you.
Dialogue||I don't take childish sentiment to work. If that's how you make all your decisions, I'm amazed you got this far.
Dialogue||I know you're trying to flatter me. Just because you got in one good line doesn't mean we'll be friends.
Dialogue||What do you do with your magic?
Dialogue||When did you discover that you had magic abilities?
Dialogue||I incorporate water magic into my life every day. I use an enchantment to keep the rain away, then when Withergate gets too grimy I bring on a downpour to wash it clean.
Dialogue||It's not something I discovered so much as honed. I could always feel the magic inside me, it was just a matter of carefully drawing it out over time. Now, I have expert control of my abilities.
Dialogue||Elves are linked with nature, which is why we excel at woodwork. Can't you tell?
Dialogue||I accept your presence here but I will not be your babysitter.
Dialogue||Like the roots of the Grand Tree, our connection with the world is inseparable.
Dialogue||Oh, you again. Sorry if I'm not great at conversation. My girlfriend, Felicity, is way better at it than me.
Dialogue||A new face? I'm Lester, it's great to meet you!
Dialogue||I'm XX. It's nice to meet you too.
Dialogue||You said XX? Unique name!
Dialogue||Welcome back! Looking for something sweet to sip on?
Dialogue||When did you learn to brew?
Dialogue||Is this place all yours?
Dialogue||I taught myself! It didn't take long, only a few years of trial and error. Luckily I had a town full of taste-testers to help!
Dialogue||Oh no, I wouldn't claim this space as my own. It's part of the Grand Tree, after all. It's more of a communal space, really.
Dialogue||Teaching yourself sounds tough. Good work!
Dialogue||It took you that long??
Dialogue||Heh, well it's easy when you've got the time. You'll find that many of us in Nel'Vari have a <i>lot</i> of free time. Just talk to Caspian or Quincy and you'll see what I mean.
Dialogue||I didn't have a teacher or anything, so I don't think it's that strange...
Dialogue||How come you're the only one working?
Dialogue||Don't you wish the others would help?
Dialogue||Simply put... it's what I love to do! Showing hospitality and warmth is what Nel'Vari should be all about, so I'm here doing my part.
Dialogue||Not to mention, I get all the free honeybrew I can drink!
Dialogue||Not really. Honestly, it's what I love to do! Showing hospitality and warmth is what Nel'Vari should be all about, so I'm here doing my part.
Dialogue||You look familiar. Have I seen you swimming in the river?
Dialogue||... No? My name is XX, I'm a farmer from Sun Haven.
Dialogue||OH! I'm sorry, I mistook you for am amphibian friend of mine. My name is Gren.
Dialogue||I've heard you're from the Human town. What is it like over there?
Dialogue||I'm from Sun Haven. It's a good place.
Dialogue||So you're half-Naga, half-Demon?
Dialogue||Are even Naga and Demons welcome there? Here in Withergate people tend to reject anyone from Human towns, but I wonder if that rejection is so mutual.
Dialogue||I know, it's an uncommon mix. I've never seen anyone else like me, anyway.
Dialogue||My parents are both very thoughtful and wanted to prepare me for a world where I may not be accepted. But for all their worry, I've fit into Withergate just fine!
Dialogue||It's a very accepting place.
Dialogue||There are not so many monsterfolk, to be honest
Dialogue||So you think even someone like me could visit sometime? Not that the king's council would approve of something like that, of course. Xyla would probably think I was some kind of spy...
Dialogue||Still, it would be nice to visit a place like that. Withergate is such a busy city. I just want a little peace and quiet every once in a while.
Dialogue||Your parents sound like caring people.
Dialogue||Your parents worried for no reason.
Dialogue||They are some of the most caring people I've ever known. I like to think I inherited a little bit of that, too.
Dialogue||That's very presumptive, you know. You have no idea what my family has been through, trying to find a home in times like these.
Dialogue||Brewing takes patience and care, just like grooming but with grains instead of hairballs.
Dialogue||You know much about fishin'? I know too much. I'd teach you a thing or two, but my teachin' days are behind me. Too old now - or at least that's my excuse, eheh.
Dialogue||Do you ever feel like you're wasting time?
Dialogue||Don't you do anything other than fish?
Dialogue||Eheh, I used to think just like that when I was younger. Funny, now that I'm old I just don't care. Maybe seems sorry to you, but for me it's real liberating.
Dialogue||I suppose every night I go to bed. Does that count?
Dialogue||Ah, but why justify myself? I fish! Don't gotta explain any more than that.
Dialogue||It looks like you've found a happy life for yourself, at least.
Dialogue||I hope I'm not so lazy when I'm your age.
Dialogue||Ain't nothin' secret about it. Just find what you love and do it. I dunno if I loved fishin' so much to start with, but it sure passes the time. Beats workin' anywhere else, that's for sure!
Dialogue||Kid, you ain't even been around long enough to know what you want. Give it a few decades and if you're lucky enough to still be around, then you can decide.
Dialogue||Until then, you go about your busy days and I'll go about keepin' this hook in the water.
Dialogue||You must be pretty good at fishing, at least.
Dialogue||Who's better at fishing then, you or Peter?
Dialogue||Oh I'm sure there's better fishers out there somewhere. Way I see it, why compete with people I don't know? Bein' the best fisher in Sun Haven would do me just fine.
Dialogue||So far as I can compare, I'd say I'm indeed pretty good at fishin'. The best? Maybe! It's all I do, so I better be pretty good at it!
Dialogue||Hm. Hard to say. Peter isn't a half bad angler. Tell you what, next time I see Peter I'll challenge him to a fish-off. See which one of us catches the most.
Dialogue||Then again, my memory ain't what it used to be. Chances are I'll forget all about it by tomorrow, eheh.
Dialogue||I try to be a fair leader, but it's Nivara who truly leads us into the future.
Dialogue||What's all the buzz about?
Dialogue||Well hello there, I haven't seen you around yet. I'm Cynthia, it's a pleasure.
Dialogue||Hi Cynthia, I'm XX.
Dialogue||XX, why does that name sound familiar? Oh well, who knows.
Dialogue||Come to me if you need a little help in the romance department. I'm sure I can lend a hand!
Dialogue||As a leader, I guide my people toward a life of enrichment.
Dialogue||I carry my whole brewing station with me wherever I go. Yes, it is quite heavy!
Dialogue||Oh look, it's our new farmer! Hello farmer, call me Quincy.
Dialogue||Hi Quincy, my name is XX.
Dialogue||XX, what a fun name!
Dialogue||Who do you think you are, anyway?
Dialogue||Hi there. Here to practice your small talk?
Dialogue||So what made you choose to sell this stuff?
Dialogue||You help people find their partners?
Dialogue||I was always the matchmaker in my hometown, so I thought I'd take my talents on the road. Who knows how many families I've started along the way?
Dialogue||I can't find the partner for you, but I can make sure you're prepared when you do find them.
Dialogue||I doubt you have that much of an effect.
Dialogue||You're doing important work!
Dialogue||You don't even know what you're talking about - not until you try it yourself!
Dialogue||It feels good knowing that I make a difference wherever I go.
Dialogue||Oh, I see.
Dialogue||I'll take any help I can get!
Dialogue||Don't sound so down - finding love is what life is all about!
Dialogue||Exactly, I can't do it for you but I can help! That's my whole business model.
Dialogue||If you're looking for help, go find Lester. He loves helping.
Dialogue||I really like how our armor looks, but boy does it get me sweating...
Dialogue||Hey there, XX. I heard you coming all the way down the street, kekeke.
Dialogue||You must be wondering, "What's an Angel doing here?"
Dialogue||As a Watcher, it's my mission to observe the world and its activity. Especially in places like this.
Dialogue||What's a "Watcher?"
Dialogue||What did you mean when you said "places like this?"
Dialogue||To some degree, all Angels are sworn Watchers. We record the history of the world without altering it ourselves.
Dialogue||Think of us merely as historians. But even so, I find that I can at least give a little help to vulnerable people, like some of the citizens here.
Dialogue||Withergate is still relatively new as a city. It's too early to tell what will become of it. From what I've seen over the past few years, though, anything can happen here.
Dialogue||You should help whenever you can.
Dialogue||Upholding tradition is important.
Dialogue||In my heart, I agree. But my cultural oath demands that I stay impartial.
Dialogue||I suppose the task of protecting the weak falls on the shoulders of righteous adventurers like yourself!
Dialogue||Yes, but I still wish I could help more directly. I envy your kind - those not tethered to the laws of your culture.
Dialogue||Why do you think anything could happen here?
Dialogue||You've been here for years?
Dialogue||This city is full of monsterfolk from all over the world. Monsterfolk aren't all that dangerous, but they can be unpredictable.
Dialogue||Just look at what they've done in one short decade - the lights, the buildings... it's unlike anything I've ever seen.
Dialogue||Yes I have. It doesn't feel that long to an experienced watcher - we are trained to withstand the passing of time. We have to stay sharp if we're to be impartial observers, after all.
Dialogue||I just started here a couple of weeks ago, so you're not the only newbie in town.
Dialogue||Centaurs like me are one in a million.
Dialogue||Maybe you're not cut out for my kind of work after all. Sorry honey, the truth stings!
Dialogue||Jun holds his classes in the back. I don't know how he deals with those shrieking kids every day.
Dialogue||Jun is a gentle kind of person, huh?
Dialogue||Is that also where he offers counseling?
Dialogue||You have to be if you're working with kids. Well, if you're <i>good</i> at working with kids.
Dialogue||It is, yes.
Dialogue||It's not as private as he would like, but Jun manages to make some real breakthroughs back there.
Dialogue||... I know that because, like I said, it's not the most private place.
Dialogue||I take it that kind of work doesn't appeal to you?
Dialogue||Were you loud as a kid?
Dialogue||I'm a librarian. My comfort zone is silence - you do the math.
Dialogue||As far as I can remember, nope. I used to draw and read a lot instead of running and screaming in circles.
Dialogue||You really shouldn't be eavesdropping on Jun.
Dialogue||So... do you like listening?
Dialogue||I can't help what I hear. I have ears! All I can do is sit here and read, pretending not to hear.
Dialogue||I wouldn't say that. I mean, I don't mind overhearing Jun's talks...
Dialogue||Okay fine, you caught me. Part of me enjoys listening in on his sessions. But it's not my fault! I can't help but overhear in the first place - it's not like I can turn my ears off.
Dialogue||Oh, hello! I wasn't sure if I'd see you again since you're not from here.
Dialogue||Are you from Nel'Vari, then?
Dialogue||The Elves have welcomed guests before, right?
Dialogue||My family has lived here for years beneath the Grand Tree. We were here before there were enough Elves to even make a city!
Dialogue||Well certainly! They're gracious hosts, the Nel'Vari Elves. Quite a few Amari folk have found wonderful lives here. Something about this place just feels like home to us.
Dialogue||You live <i>under</i> the Grand Tree?
Dialogue||That sounds a little... dirty.
Dialogue||Of course! You won't find me living in the branches. I'm no tree frog, you know.
Dialogue||Only in the sense that we live in a dirt hole. But it's really much grander than it sounds! Don't you think we would have made it nice by now?
Dialogue||Sure, it's still a dirt hole. The nicest dirt hole in the forest!
Dialogue||So all the Amari get along?
Dialogue||It sounds like you're very comfortable living here.
Dialogue||With the Elves? Absolutely! Though I will say there has been some tension between me and some of the bug Amari.
Dialogue||My reflexes kicked in when I met Beeanca and... yeah, we don't talk much.
Dialogue||You're back? I'm sick and tired of newcomers.
Dialogue||What's wrong with newcomers?
Dialogue||You need a new attitude.
Dialogue||The last time we let a newcomer inside of Nel'Vari, they came back with a small army. That may have been fifty years ago, but it could happen today.
Dialogue||Yeah? Well you need to stay in your own town, with your own people. Leave the Elves alone for once.
Dialogue||You sound paranoid.
Dialogue||It's smart to be on guard.
Dialogue||If you'd seen the fight I saw, in these very fields, you would be paranoid too.
Dialogue||Hm, maybe you're not a threat to us after all. But don't think for a moment that I'm letting my guard down around you.
Dialogue||Don't the Elves live in peace?
Dialogue||I think you're worried about nothing.
Dialogue||Yes, but there's trouble coming. I can feel it. It feels... cold.
Dialogue||Since you don't seem to have figured it out yet - I don't much care for you or what you think.
Dialogue||Keep your eyes and ears open, XX. You never know who's around.
Dialogue||One day, we will have to leave Nel'Vari. Hoho, but that day is far off.
Dialogue||One, two, make me a brew! Three, four, give us a pour! Heh, rhyming.
Dialogue||Sometimes I get confused by the lights at night.
Dialogue||So everyone outside Nel'Vari actually wears shoes on their feet all the time? That's rough.
Dialogue||My wings are covered in scales, see? You can look, but don't touch!
Dialogue||The quiet of the night sustains me.
Dialogue||Yo, pal. Is there something I can do for you?
Dialogue||Hello. Um, who are you?
Dialogue||I'm XX, the new farmer.
Dialogue||Oh that's right! Nathaniel briefed us on the new arrival. My name is Pinto.
Dialogue||Hey *hic* farmer.
Dialogue||So... why are you here?
Dialogue||Is Sun Haven much different from your home?
Dialogue||What, an Elf ain't allowed to get a drink at his favorite waterin' hole? I hope I'm not *hic* <i>inconveniencing</i> ya. If I'm not welcome, I can hit the road anytime.
Dialogue||How do you know that I'm not from Sun Haven? Ain't I a native, too?
Dialogue||I didn't mean it that way.
Dialogue||Well, what's your answer?
Dialogue||Yeah all right, you seem *hic* genuine enough. No offense taken, farmer.
Dialogue||It's like I said, this is my favorite place to *hic* get a drink. I stumbled in from the road and *hic* took a seat. Simple as that.
Dialogue||I don't gotta answer none of your questions. 'Specially if that's how ya talk to people. No manners.
Dialogue||I'm sorry, my mistake.
Dialogue||I just haven't seen you around town is all.
Dialogue||HAH! Don't ya worry, kid. I'm messin' with ya.
Dialogue||I'm not native here. But my home's not much different, all told. Friendly *hic* people, tight community. I guess the only real difference is - it's full'a Elves!
Dialogue||You run the farm now, right? That explains the dirty footprints.
Dialogue||I've heard people talking about this monster town, Withergate? It sounds like bad news.
Dialogue||What are you up to? I'm going to dip my toes in the river. Gotta make sure it's still wet!
Dialogue||The shortest distance between two people is... a gift!
Dialogue||Eh, hey. I'm Clay. Who are you again?
Dialogue||I'm XX.
Dialogue||Right, that's your name. The Elder told us about you. Guess I forgot.
Dialogue||Felicity keeps making me take her out on dates. Good thing I've got plenty of tickets.
Dialogue||Love the smell of fresh soil in the morning!
Dialogue||Hello there! Admiring my shine, are we?
Dialogue||My name's XX, who are you?
Dialogue||My true name was lost long ago. Here, I'm called the Spectral Knight. I quite like the title!
Dialogue||Eh? You say you're an angler? You don't look like any angler I've seen before.
Dialogue||Apologies, right now isn't a good time for conversation. Not unless you know anything about leading a seminar on safety while woodcrafting.
Dialogue||What are you looking at? Haven't you ever seen a mighty dragon before?
Dialogue||Okay, maybe I'm not a guardian like the Moon Dragon... but I can still breathe fire! A little.
Dialogue||My name is XX. I didn't mean to stare.
Dialogue||Ehh, it's fine. My name is Wyatt. I can't really get mad at you for looking. I <i>am</i> an impressive dragon, after all!
Dialogue||Hey, it's the weirdo! I wondered if I'd see you again. Us weirdos gotta stick together, hehe.
Dialogue||Who are you, anyway?
Dialogue||Why do you keep calling me a weirdo?
Dialogue||Hop, hop! You can call me Tali. Because that's what my name is!
Dialogue||When I was a Human, I had lots of friends! But they're all scared of me now, so I left my home land. You could say I'm homeless, but Withergate is a home for everyone!
Dialogue||Aw, don't feel bad! Being a weirdo is a good thing. Just look at me, hehe. I'm a <i>hopping vampire</i>, it's like a vampire, but with hopping! Pretty weird, right?
Dialogue||You definitely stand out around here.
Dialogue||You're not that different from everyone else here.
Dialogue||Don't you mean <i>hop</i> out?! Hehe!
Dialogue||Withergate is nice, but someday I'll get bored and go somewhere else! Maybe we'll meet again in a distant land. That'd be neat, huh?
Dialogue||Aw, but I want to be a weirdo, like you, weirdo! Hehe.
Dialogue||But... you're not hopping.
Dialogue||Why do you like hopping?
Dialogue||Hehe, I only said I was a hopping vampire. I didn't say I actually hopped, you weirdo! Hop hop!
Dialogue||It's so nice having a farmer in town again! Are you loving it??
Dialogue||Where are you from?
Dialogue||You seem spirited!
Dialogue||I'm from a city farther to the west called Petri. It's in the middle of a steep valley, so you can really only take one road in or out.
Dialogue||I love being a soldier in Sun Haven. I could have ended up anywhere, so I feel lucky to have this assignment.
Dialogue||What was it like living in Petri?
Dialogue||Do you miss it?
Dialogue||It's a much bigger town than Sun Haven and there's a much stronger military presence. Soldiers are highly respected out there.
Dialogue||It's a little more relaxed here in Sun Haven, but I find it absolutely charming!
Dialogue||Not too much, no. There's a much stronger military presence in Petri. Soldiers are highly respected out there.
Dialogue||That's a great attitude for a soldier to have.
Dialogue||A soldier's life sounds miserable.
Dialogue||Thanks! I try to follow Nathaniel's lead. He's always in a good mood.
Dialogue||No way! Clearly you're not the soldier type, so you wouldn't understand.
Dialogue||You now? Haven't you bugged me enough?
Dialogue||My mother is a Naga, and my father a Demon. That makes me a Nemon. Or maybe a Daga.
Dialogue||The only problem with this place is the food. What's a tiger have to do to get some meat?
Dialogue||Careful where you're going - it's easy to bump into people here.
Dialogue||Are you a fast swimmer? I bet you're even faster than Rel'Tar!
Dialogue||What makes you ask that?
Dialogue||Rel'Tar?
Dialogue||I want to go swimming, but I can't because my wings won't work anymore. So I ask people about swimming instead!
Dialogue||Yeah, the crossbow man! He swims fast, but he used to be faster. That's what he says, anyway.
Dialogue||Rel'Tar is nice but he gets real angry when I play with his crossbows, hehe.
Dialogue||If you could, I bet you'd be a fast swimmer.
Dialogue||You should stop talking about swimming if it's dangerous to you.
Dialogue||I think so too! I'm the fastest flyer of all my sisters. Swimming looks a lot like flying, so I know I'd be fast.
Dialogue||It's just talk, sheesh... I won't jump in the ocean or anything, promise!
Dialogue||What do you mean, he used to be faster?
Dialogue||Do you spend a lot of time with him?
Dialogue||His legs don't work like they used to. Or maybe, his knees? He told me but I don't remember 'cause he tells me lots of things.
Dialogue||I know for sure that he doesn't run very fast at all. He swims even faster than he runs, isn't that funny? Just like a fishy!
Dialogue||Sure, he tells me lots of things. I learn a lot, too. Like, his legs don't work like they used to. Or maybe it's his knees? He told me but I don't remember 'cause he tells me lots of things.
Dialogue||Hello there. I don't believe we've met, have we?
Dialogue||I'm XX, from the town of Sun Haven.
Dialogue||Nel'Vari is a beautiful place made more beautiful by those who appreciate it. I am Opal, and it is good to meet you.
Dialogue||This city isn't a bad place to spend eternity!
Dialogue||One downside to living in Withergate? The flashing lights make my eyes fuzzy if I look at them too long.
Dialogue||Hello again. I'm sorry if I was a little distant when we first spoke. I'm getting better at being... more friendly.
Dialogue||It's okay to be shy, you don't have to apologize.
Dialogue||Did you know there's a rainbow in your hair?
Dialogue||Who said I was shy? I just don't usually like talking to other people very much.
Dialogue||I used to focus mainly on myself, although these days I'm learning to open up a little more.
Dialogue||Er, yeah. I did. My girlfriend Felicity wanted me to try it. She's always talking about bright colors and that sort of stuff. I don't know if I like it very much, but it makes her really happy.
Dialogue||Just admit that you're shy.
Dialogue||It's brave to go outside of your comfort zone.
Dialogue||People not listening to me is a big reason why I don't like to chat.
Dialogue||Yeah, that's what Felicity tells me. Maybe I should try a bit harder...
Dialogue||It's sweet to put your girlfriend's happiness first like that.
Dialogue||At least she likes it.
Dialogue||Some of the other Demons around here would disagree with that, but I stopped caring about what they thought years ago.
Dialogue||Yeah, Felicity means a lot to me. My personality used to be a lot colder, but she's really rubbed off on me. I never met another Demon like her.
Dialogue||Hey citizen, you're a farmer right? Your life must be so different from mine!
Dialogue||Nobody knows the forests around here like I do.
Dialogue||Ooh, that's a nice look! But don't you think you could update it?
Dialogue||Hm? Oh, you're still here.
Dialogue||Runnin' the books for the apartments is a nice gig, but it's sure boring.
Dialogue||You got anything I could help you with?
Dialogue||I'm XX, from Sun Haven. Are you an Amari?
Dialogue||Whoa, right off the bat with the questions. Nah, I'm a cat monster. If you don't know the difference, don't expect me to explain it to you.
Dialogue||The name is Tony. Actually, you should forget I even have a name.
Dialogue||Hey, um... Have you seen a copper helmet anywhere? I put mine down... somewhere...
Dialogue||Don't you get in trouble when you lose your gear?
Dialogue||Pinto, do you even like it in the army?
Dialogue||You don't know the half of it. Has Roza ever yelled at you before? I can feel her voice in my bones when she yells.
Dialogue||Even though I'm still terrible at it, I'm having a lot of fun. When we're relieved of duty for the day, we all get to just hang around the barracks. I've never had a group of friends to do that with before.
Dialogue||So yeah, I love it!
Dialogue||I'll find your helmet for you!
Dialogue||I hope you find it soon.
Dialogue||You will? Wow, okay! I think I was walking nearby town square when I lost it. Thanks, farmer!
Dialogue||That makes two of us. How many chances do you get before they kick you out of the army?
Dialogue||Your training will catch on, one day!
Dialogue||There are easier ways to make friends.
Dialogue||That's what I keep telling myself - but it's nice to hear it from someone else for once!
Dialogue||Maybe for you. Making friends has always been hard for me, even harder than this military stuff.
Dialogue||Do you have any nectar?
Dialogue||Everything's all good with me, thanks. You can stop asking.
Dialogue||Silkmoths... I just don't understand how they get so big!
Dialogue||I love a nice breeze between my wings.
Dialogue||Hello again. You seem pretty busy, huh?
Dialogue||It's true, I have a lot going on right now.
Dialogue||Aren't you busy?
Dialogue||It must be nice to have so much to do. Living around here can get dull, but I've learned to lean into the routine. Do you like being so busy?
Dialogue||We tend to take our time in Nel'Vari. We don't really live by deadlines or due dates. That's why I like to do a lot of fishing. I can help the town and relax at the same time!
Dialogue||I enjoy keeping busy.
Dialogue||I don't like working, I'd rather relax.
Dialogue||I can see that just by looking at you. Your hands are calloused pretty good!
Dialogue||It must be a struggle to keep your farm then. I guess that speaks to your character, huh?
Dialogue||Productivity and relaxation? That's smart!
Dialogue||You must be a great fisher, then.
Dialogue||Do you think so? It's just the norm for me!
Dialogue||I usually come away with a few fish. It's easy here, though.
Dialogue||Hey, you should fish Nel'Vari waters! If you haven't already, I'm sure you'll catch something new.
Dialogue||Watch out, here comes a new face!
Dialogue||Nice meeting you, my name's XX.
Dialogue||XX - I like that! Mine's Lars. Good to have you in Nel'Vari, XX.
Dialogue||When I have a goal, I take aim and always hit my target.
Dialogue||Wait right there... yes! You just inspired my next painting!
Dialogue||Sometimes I like to fly real high up and float down on my wingies.
Dialogue||I can totally use these wings to fly! Walking is just easier, that's all.
Dialogue||Did Nathaniel say anything about a surprise fitness test?
Dialogue||Enjoying the day? Why not sip on something sweet!
Dialogue||Your search for the best woodworking has ended. What can I get you?
Dialogue||Is it difficult selling your goods here?
Dialogue||You mean in Nel'Vari? Sure, it's tricky selling wooden goods in a town full of woodworkers. The key is to exceed in quality.
Dialogue||His name is Telumbe, and he's the best! He's been in our family a long time. I think he's older than Sylvia and I combined.
Dialogue||You must really be the best in town, then.
Dialogue||How did you become such a fine artisan?
Dialogue||You bet! Between Sylvia and me, there's not an Elf in the world that holds a candle to our skill.
Dialogue||Practice, practice, practice. All I've done since I was a kid is carve wood. Sometimes it's like I can hear the wood, telling me how to shape it.
Dialogue||Doesn't Telumbe get tired pulling the cart?
Dialogue||It sounds like Telumbe is a perfect companion for you.
Dialogue||Telumbe could pull 10 of these. Don't underestimate him just because he's old.
Dialogue||He really is! Animals are crucial to our way of life, so they become our family.
Dialogue||Good seein' ya, farmer.
Dialogue||Angel brings us fruit to eat sometimes. Then we dance!
Dialogue||Good to see you, farmer. You're putting on some muscle. About time.
Dialogue||I guess I am a little stronger these days.
Dialogue||What's the most difficult job you ever took?
Dialogue||Wear your muscles with pride, kid. They're the trophies of your hard work.
Dialogue||Most difficult? Hm. Guess it must've been about a year back. Customer walks in wanting mithril armor - for her bird.
Dialogue||Guess she trained some kind of eagle to follow her into battle.
Dialogue||Calling your muscles trophies is kind of silly.
Dialogue||I don't like to gloat.
Dialogue||You think it's silly to work your hands raw for three decades? I didn't think so.
Dialogue||Heh, well that's good. But I'm not telling you to gloat. You can be proud of yourself and humble to others at the same time.
Dialogue||I don't call myself a master, but I don't deny it either. Just keep working hard, kid.
Dialogue||What did you do?
Dialogue||Is it even possible to make armor for a bird?
Dialogue||Fulfilled the order, of course. I had to make it a loose chain mail so it'd be light enough, but we got that bird covered head to claw in mithril.
Dialogue||It is if you know your metal. I hade to make it a loose chain mail so it'd be light enough, but we got that bird covered head to claw in mithril.
Dialogue||I cook the food and pour the drinks, but Mari is the beating heart of this place.
Dialogue||I could use a good dirt nap...
Dialogue||Seems like you could use a big fuzzy hug!
Dialogue||Are you here to find a book, or are you planning to chat all day?
Dialogue||*ACHOO!* Ugh... Sorry, were you talking to me?
Dialogue||I have quite the roar, but I don't want to strain my silky voice.
Dialogue||I wonder if I'll ever see a real battle... I hope not.
Dialogue||Farmer.
Dialogue||How did you become a master blacksmith?
Dialogue||You have a reputation as a tough teacher.
Dialogue||A lifetime of putting iron to the forge will do that.
Dialogue||Anyway, can't be any kind of blacksmith before you've got an anvil. Have you made yourself one?
Dialogue||You're darn right, I do. You don't learn discipline by being coddled.
Dialogue||Of course I have.
Dialogue||Of course I have... not.
Dialogue||Then you're ready to make your own gear, which means you need ore. Take the minecart into the mines to get some ore. Go on, put that pickaxe I gave you to work.
Dialogue||You'll need ore to craft one. Take the minecart into the mines to get some ore. Go on, put that pickaxe I gave you to work.
Dialogue||Hard work is the best teacher there is.
Dialogue||What if you tried a more positive teaching strategy?
Dialogue||That's right. Sounds like the farm fell into capable hands.
Dialogue||More positive? The only thing I'm positive about is this - you're a total ninny.
Dialogue||A hot cup always perks me up in the morning.
Dialogue||A farmer, huh? No offense, but if you're working hard in life then you're doing something wrong.
Dialogue||Every night I go to sleep thinking of all the couples I've helped along.
Dialogue||Hmm? I haven't seen you before...
Dialogue||I'm new to Nel'Vari. My name is XX.
Dialogue||XX, I'm Willow. Remember my name because one day I'm going to be the most powerful enchantress in the world!
Dialogue||Hello! I'm Sylvia, merchant of Elven goods.
Dialogue||Hi Sylvia, I'm XX.
Dialogue||XX? What a curious name!
Dialogue||Hold on, you're the one who's from Sun Haven, right? That's so interesting!
Dialogue||We don't come around every day, you know!
Dialogue||Mana orbs are what we've always used as a currency in Nel'Vari. They must seem strange to one like yourself.
Dialogue||The best part about working at night is getting the bounce mushrooms all to yourself. But don't tell anyone I told you that.
Dialogue||Ronald and Mari got plenty of work for me. I even got my own bed upstairs!
Dialogue||Is that you I hear, XX? I wasn't sure if you were going to stick around, kekeke.
Dialogue||What is seeing the world with your echo like?
Dialogue||Why wouldn't I stick around?
Dialogue||You're a curious person. I like that!
Dialogue||Okay, imagine that when you shouted you'd see a picture of everything around you. Does that make sense to you? Well, it would if you were a bat, kekeke.
Dialogue||Well, you sounded like you were from that Human town. What's it called? <i>Sud</i> Haven?
Dialogue||Anyway, I should have given you more credit. For someone from Sud Haven, you're more than meets the ear.
Dialogue||That sounds perfect for living in the dark.
Dialogue||I'd rather use my eyes to see.
Dialogue||Exactly. Why else do you think I came to a place like Withergate? Lots of darkness, plenty of stuff to do, and sights to hear.
Dialogue||Sure you do, until you're stuck in the dark. Then you'll wish you had my echo, kekeke.
Dialogue||It's <i>Sun</i> Haven, actually.
Dialogue||That's a compliment, right?
Dialogue||Are you sure? That doesn't sound right to me.
Dialogue||Kekeke, of course! I don't know what they say over in Sud Haven, but that's a genuine compliment among my people.
Dialogue||I used to be quite an adventurer. Not unlike yourself!
Dialogue||If you're not goin' in, get lost.
Dialogue||Angels have pledged themselves to the betterment of all races. You know, I peek in on Sun Haven from time to time too!
Dialogue||I can see what you're thinking... Yes, my fur feels just as luxurious as it looks.
Dialogue||Oh, you again. Welcome to the party.
Dialogue||You say that like it's not a party.
Dialogue||Why did you choose to become a soldier?
Dialogue||Yeah, that's on purpose. There's no party here.
Dialogue||It was my last option. I dropped out of my apprenticeship and didn't feel like delivering baby griffons for a living like my parents. So, here I am. Soldier boy.
Dialogue||You should just leave if you hate it here.
Dialogue||You're a breath of fresh air.
Dialogue||Listen, I don't hate it here. I don't love it either. I'm just bored.
Dialogue||Hah, good one.
Dialogue||Well this isn't so bad compared to that, huh?
Dialogue||So you don't have any personal interest in being a soldier?
Dialogue||You're not wrong, but that's a low bar.
Dialogue||Not a bit. But it pays well and I get free food, so it's good enough for me.
Dialogue||Hop, hop! You don't look you're from around Withergate! Then again, neither do I! I'm from a land far away from anything you've probably ever heard of!
Dialogue||Guard duty isn't the most interesting work, but there's usually someone interesting to talk to - like you!
Dialogue||Hi, citizen. Oh, you're the new arrival huh? Neat.
Dialogue||My name's XX. What's yours?
Dialogue||I'm Calvin. Welcome to paradise.
Dialogue||My sisters are both older and younger than me.
Dialogue||I think I'll have some tea tonight. You'll probably be fast asleep by the time I'm drinking it.
Dialogue||Good food, fun atmosphere. This place is pretty slick!
Dialogue||Can I help you? I don't know that I can.
Dialogue||Hey again, XX! Are you fitting in yet? Don't worry, it took some time for me, too.
Dialogue||Why would Withergate treat other Demons like outsiders?
Dialogue||You don't look like any Demon I've ever seen before.
Dialogue||I'm a Demon, but I come from a village where Humans and Demons live side by side. When I first arrived here, everyone called me an outsider, too!
Dialogue||Hehe, where I'm from, Demon culture is a bit different. We're more adapted to living in the sunlight, unlike Demons from Withergate. Still, I looove the darkness!!
Dialogue||Why did you move to Withergate?
Dialogue||How did you deal with it?
Dialogue||I met my boyfriend Felix when he visited my village a couple of years ago. He told me all about Withergate, and I had to check it out! So here I am.
Dialogue||I just gave it time. Soon enough, everyone got to know me well enough that they accepted me. As long as you're not a jerk, people will come around!
Dialogue||Your style is very unique!
Dialogue||Is it really a good idea to be so different here?
Dialogue||It really does make me stick out around here, doesn't it?! That's okay! I love turning heads, and I love keeping up with Withergate's crazy style!
Dialogue||What a silly question. I love my style, it doesn't matter what you think about it. Or anyone else, for that matter!
Dialogue||Welcome. I'm Amanda, the librarian. Please treat my books with respect.
Dialogue||My name is XX. Happy to meet you.
Dialogue||Mhm, sure you are. Anyway, please be quiet while you're here.
Dialogue||Huh? What, is there an emergency? Didn't think so...
Dialogue||Withergate has some great acoustics. If you had ears like mine, you'd agree.
Dialogue||So what if I have no hair? Do all the women have hair where you come from?
Dialogue||What time is it? I'm already feeling drowsy...
Dialogue||Peter is like a nephew to me. I taught him everything he knows! Everything he knows about fishin', anyway.
Dialogue||I just woke up from a nap but I'm still tired. How is that possible??
Dialogue||They say that a smile is the window to your soul! Or maybe it's the eyes? Either way, try and smile!
Dialogue||Roza has been on me lately. She says she caught me sleeping on the job, but I don't remember that happening.
Dialogue||Mari and I have poured our hearts into this place.
Dialogue||Hey, neighbor. I'll introduce myself - I'm Raimi. People might tell you I'm the toughest guy in town, but that's just what people say.
Dialogue||Good meeting you Raimi, I'm XX.
Dialogue||Oh, XX? Thaaat's right, you're the farmer we've been expecting. We really needed someone to clean up that old farm. Great to have you!
Dialogue||Have you ever basked in the glow of the moon before, XX?
Dialogue||Why do you like the moon so much?
Dialogue||What do you do here in Nel'Vari?
Dialogue||There's a balance to nature. Fire and water, plant and animal, sun and moon. Most of the citizens in Nel'Vari embrace the sun. Elves like me are the other side of that balance.
Dialogue||I'm an attendant to the moon. We take care of Nel'Vari during the night, while the others rest. I take my task seriously, though really I just love working in moonlight.
Dialogue||The moon is beautiful. People should appreciate it more often.
Dialogue||The sun is way more important than the moon, though.
Dialogue||You truly respect the duality of nature. Perhaps you're more at home here than you know, XX.
Dialogue||That's a primitive way to think. Every bit of nature is important, XX, and no one part is worth more than another.
Dialogue||So you're the night crew?
Dialogue||Does Nel'Vari need that much care, even at night?
Dialogue||That's a strange way of putting it, but yes.
Dialogue||Nature doesn't sleep like you or I. Even at night there's much to be taken care of, and it's the attendants of the moon who handle it.
Dialogue||That is correct, XX. We live in a delicate ecosystem.
Dialogue||Finding this café felt to me like fate. I know that's a strong statement, but it comes from a strong feeling!
Dialogue||We're supposed to guard against monsters, but I don't think the monsters even care to show up.
Dialogue||Roar... Oooh... Monster noises...
Dialogue||What, haven't seen a spirit before?
Dialogue||I prefer to lounge for most of my day.
Dialogue||Do you know King Aster? He's going to treat me to a banquet... I'm his royal guest!
Dialogue||Sorry, you said something? I was absorbing energy from the sun.
Dialogue||Bless Nivara for the sunshine and the rainfall.
Dialogue||Hey, farmer. You'll need to build some muscle if you're going to tame that land.
Dialogue||Tactics are important in every fight. Strength alone can't win against a good plan.
Dialogue||You're who's taking that land? Hm. Thought you'd be bigger.
Dialogue||... Thanks? My name's XX.
Dialogue||Pleasure. Call me Solon. If you need some new gear, you come right to me.
Dialogue||Is the honey starting to crystallize? I better set up the heater...
Dialogue||You've got a wild energy about you. Are you part Amari?
Dialogue||Hi XX. Be sure to draw plenty of mana orbs today, alright?
Dialogue||Are you friends with Vaan?
Dialogue||Why do you want me to draw mana orbs?
Dialogue||Me and Vaan get along pretty well. He's one of the few other people in Nel'Vari who seems to appreciate taking it slow. I mean to say we don't work too hard.
Dialogue||I'm a mana comber. I search the forest and collect the mana people leave behind. It's important not to leave mana lying around, you know.
Dialogue||No matter how careful someone is, they're bound to accidentally leave some leftover mana.
Dialogue||Only you can choose the best way to live your life.
Dialogue||You should work hard if that's what is expected of you.
Dialogue||That's the kind of attitude I'm talking about. I wasn't too sure how I felt about you before, but you're an alright person, XX.
Dialogue||No way. They say rivers take the path of least resistance. If it's good enough for rivers, it's good enough for me.
Dialogue||You've been stealing my mana orbs?
Dialogue||How do you leave mana behind?
Dialogue||No no, nothing like that! It's only the mana you left behind. It can be found everywhere if you know how to look for it.
Dialogue||In fact, gathering leftover mana is important to protecting fragile plants and insects. Just think of me as another part of the ecosystem!
Dialogue||When you draw mana orbs from nature, you don't get every last bit. Some gets left behind, but I know how to find it.
Dialogue||I like to think I'm changing people's lives by changing their look. You should really give me a shot!
Dialogue||What got you into the salon business?
Dialogue||When you say I should "really" give you a shot...
Dialogue||I used to cut my whole family's hair. It's the only skill I have other than archery, but that doesn't make much money.
Dialogue||Oops, there goes my mouth again. I don't mean it like an insult. But it's never a bad time to update your look, you know.
Dialogue||Archery? That's impressive!
Dialogue||Why do you like archery?
Dialogue||Thanks! I practice all the time so I can join the army. I figure joining the army as an archer is my best bet to travel the world for free!
Dialogue||I practice all the time so I can join the army. I figure joining the army as an archer is my best bet to travel the world for free!
Dialogue||I don't care what you think about my look.
Dialogue||I like that you're up front about it.
Dialogue||Okay, sheesh. I was just offering to help. Thin skin, huh?
Dialogue||Some people call me blunt, but I think I'm just honest. I'm glad you can take it.
Dialogue||Hm? Oh, I mean... Roar! Fear my inhuman howl!
Dialogue||Okay... I'm XX.
Dialogue||Hold on, aren't you the newcomer from Sun Haven? Finally, someone I can trust.
Dialogue||My name is Phoebe. I'm undercover here - nobody knows I'm Human so don't give me away!
Dialogue||I might not be great with a sword, but that doesn't mean I can't contribute!
Dialogue||You came here to talk to Nivara? Good luck, she'll only try to get you to do work.
Dialogue||Angelkind aren't usually the type for combat - I guess I'm just not like the other Angels.
Dialogue||You wanna try not to crowd me, kid? The guards have been keeping their eyes on you since you got here. I don't like their attention.
Dialogue||I'll be glad to help you as soon as you actually find a book to read.
Dialogue||Don't worry, I'm always on guard.
Dialogue||Allie tells me I train too much.
Dialogue||A monster attack from Withergate? They wouldn't stand a chance!
Dialogue||Eh, you again? What's the problem?
Dialogue||You're sure in a bad mood all the time.
Dialogue||So, those snakes on your head...
Dialogue||Gee, thanks. It's talk like that what really lifts my spirits. I've turned over a new leaf thanks to you, kid. Now if you don't mind, I've got some charity work to do with my newfound perspective.
Dialogue||What about 'em? You do know these are attached to my head, right? I'm not just wearin' a wig made of snakes here.
Dialogue||You don't have to be so sarcastic.
Dialogue||You're pretty funny!
Dialogue||Actually, I do. It's my defense mechanism. In other words, it's how I get rid of annoyin' kids like yourself.
Dialogue||You think that's funny? Ah, sheesh... Can't you tell I'm tryin' to get rid of you? Well at least one of us is havin' a good time.
Dialogue||Oh - of course, I totally knew that.
Dialogue||I'm sorry, I had no idea they were part of your head.
Dialogue||Look, if you're goin' to tell a lie then you gotta at least put some effort into it. Sheesh, what a joke.
Dialogue||Live and learn, I guess. Don't make 'em upset by staring at 'em too long. It's annoying when they slither around too much. Makes my head itch.
Dialogue||Hello again, farmer. Making yourself at home?
Dialogue||I bet it's probably easier to relax here than in Sun Haven.
Dialogue||What's the toughest thing about living in Nel'Vari?
Dialogue||Have you ever tried farming?
Dialogue||The only thing I find difficult about living here is being so cut off from the rest of the world. I love my fellow Elves, but I'd like to meet some new faces every now and then.
Dialogue||The Elder's disciple, Wesley, asked me to try my hand with the farm west of here. I just made a big mess of it. Haven't tried since.
Dialogue||Lucky I'm here, then!
Dialogue||Nothing is stopping you from going out on your own.
Dialogue||Heh, indeed it is lucky! If only visitors like you came around more often.
Dialogue||I guess that's true, but it's dangerous to go alone.
Dialogue||It's not for everyone.
Dialogue||It's not that hard.
Dialogue||That's definitely true in my case. I guess not all Elves have a green thumb after all.
Dialogue||Maybe not for a farmer, but not everyone is a farmer... Right? I can't be the only one who has trouble with it!
Dialogue||You must be the new farmer I've heard about. Welcome to our tavern!
Dialogue||Hello, my name is XX.
Dialogue||And I'm Ronald. Let me know if you're craving anything to eat or drink, you hear?
Dialogue||Isn't Withergate just Wither<i>great</i>?! Oh come on, that was a good one!
Dialogue||I try to keep my spirits up. Positivity is contagious!
Dialogue||It's not bad, making honest money.
Dialogue||Do you believe in love at first sight?
Dialogue||Look what the dog dragged in, another outsider. Just what the city needed.
Dialogue||You again... Is this gonna be a regular thing?
Dialogue||Finally - you're late. If you've got the tickets then I've got the... wait, you're not the guy! Uhh, nevermind!
Dialogue||Fireballs and lightning bolts are clever, but books are the only magic I need.
Dialogue||Having a good day, I hope?
Dialogue||Once I found a flower so big, I crawled inside it! But it smelled gross inside.
Dialogue||If ya need me, I'll be here. Heh heh!
Dialogue||Hello again, XX. How does Nel'Vari compare to the stories you've heard?
Dialogue||You seem a little different from the other Elves.
Dialogue||Have you ever left Nel'Vari?
Dialogue||I'm an attendant to the moon. I do my work at night, such as caring for the trees and tending to animals, when many of the others in Nel'Vari sleep.
Dialogue||I've never been to another village, but I've been deep inside our forests. I consider everywhere that nature lives undisturbed to be part of Nel'Vari.
Dialogue||Do you worship the moon?
Dialogue||How does one become a moon attendant?
Dialogue||It's nothing like that. I simply live and work by the moon, much in the way you live and work by the sun.
Dialogue||Living so closely with the night manifests itself physically as we attendants live our lives. We're not hard to pick out from the others, is what I'm saying.
Dialogue||We're free to volunteer as we wish. Elves are very closely in tune with nature, and this manifests physically as we live our lives.
Dialogue||We're not hard to pick out from the others, is what I'm saying.
Dialogue||What a beautiful way of seeing the world.
Dialogue||Towns don't work like that, they have to have solid borders.
Dialogue||Yes, indeed. If you spend more time among the people of Nel'Vari then you might learn to see the world the same way.
Dialogue||Hm, you can live by your rules and I will live by mine.
Dialogue||It's natural for animals to fight. But people like us choose whether or not to fight.
Dialogue||Oh, hi there! Welcome in, my name is Heather.
Dialogue||Hi Heather, I'm XX.
Dialogue||Good to meet you. Say, are you the XX that funded the café renovation? You're the reason I have a job! Thank you.
Dialogue||I'm Edwin. Nice to *hic* meet ya.
Dialogue||You can call me XX. Good meeting you, too.
Dialogue||I hope ya aren't *hic* waitin' for this seat here.
Dialogue||My home is in the forest across the river. The land there is covered in flowers and berry bushes!
Dialogue||So much time and so little to be done...
Dialogue||Hey there! Nice to see a new face in town. Call me Christine.
Dialogue||My name's XX!
Dialogue||What a fun name! Well I hope you're looking for seeds, XX. I've got plenty!
Dialogue||You might have impressed everyone else by aiding Ulmus and winning the Elder's favor, but you don't impress me.
Dialogue||Well... I'm XX.
Dialogue||My name is Morgan. I don't expect us to make friends.
Dialogue||Well well, you're definitely a new face. It's about time someone new came through.
Dialogue||Hey there, I'm XX. I'm from Sun Haven.
Dialogue||XX, huh? Call me Lucius. Have a nice night, or a nice day. Whichever you prefer.
Dialogue||Good to see you, honey!
Dialogue||I wish I could enchant my tummy to stop rumbling...
Dialogue||Just another tourist...
Dialogue||Whose colors do you like the most? It's okay, I won't tell my sisters.
Dialogue||I don't care what kind of work I do. It's nice just having a roof over my head.
Dialogue||You're that farmer from Sun Haven, right? Farming, now there's a hard job.
Dialogue||My name is XX, good to meet you.
Dialogue||And you, XX.
Dialogue||Nothing is more relaxing than warm sunlight on your cheeks...
Dialogue||Ah, XX! Delighted to see you, my friend. How can I assist you today?
Dialogue||I'm curious about Nel'Vari's history.
Dialogue||I'm curious about the Nel'Vari Elves.
Dialogue||To learn about our history, you need only learn the history of the Grand Tree. We've been with it since the first Elves stepped foot on these grounds.
Dialogue||Yes, our origins are entwined with the tree like so many blooming vines, hoho!
Dialogue||Ah, wonderful! But be careful XX, if you become too comfortable here then you may never want to leave, hoho!
Dialogue||I'm sure you know by now that there are different tribes of Elves, yes? Many Elves live a nomadic life in our world. Never settling, always moving.
Dialogue||Nel'Vari Elves are different though, because we've been with the Grand Tree for the entire history of our civilization!
Dialogue||So you're just tree people?
Dialogue||No wonder it's such a revered monument.
Dialogue||It seems you think the same as so many outsiders in the past who have disregarded the tree as any old stump. Pity you can't see the world through my eyes.
Dialogue||Indeed, and I'm glad you see it that way too. Outsiders in the past have disregarded the tree as any old stump.
Dialogue||Only those who have taken the time to understand our people have also grasped the tree's importance.
Dialogue||What I'm saying is, you have the spirit of a true Nel'Vari Elf! Hohoho!
Dialogue||Do you think it's better this way?
Dialogue||None of you have ever left?
Dialogue||I don't know that it's better, but it's certainly peaceful. Just ask any of our more curious kin who have wandered off into the forest. You'll learn that they always find their way back home.
Dialogue||Life in Nel'Vari is sweet, what can I say? Hoho!
Dialogue||Hoho, certainly a handful of our more curious kin have wandered off into the forest, but they find their way back home.
Dialogue||Hello there. Enjoying the darkness?
Dialogue||Hey, I'm XX. Who are you?
Dialogue||Pleased to meet you, XX. I'm Cassia. I understand if you stare a bit. It's not every day that you see someone who is half-Naga, half-Demon.
Dialogue||Sorry, did you say something? I was running drills in my head.
Dialogue||Good day, neighbor! Stay and chat a bit?
Dialogue||So who's the best soldier in the corps?
Dialogue||How did you end up here?
Dialogue||Ah sheesh, you can't ask me something like that. I don't want to hurt anyone's feelings.
Dialogue||I joined the army after they saved my village from a rampaging golem. Nathaniel and Roza led the defense themselves, riding in on horseback and forcing the golem back into the mountains.
Dialogue||After seeing that I thought, "Wow, those are real heroes." I guess I wanted to be a hero too!
Dialogue||I get it. You just don't want to say it's you!
Dialogue||Come on, I won't tell.
Dialogue||What! I mean, thank you, but it's definitely not me.
Dialogue||Look, I'll say this - it's one of the women and she's a strong leader. That should make it pretty obvious...
Dialogue||Really, I don't like judging people like this. It feels too gossipy.
Dialogue||What's the most heroic thing you've done so far?
Dialogue||Do you feel like a hero now?
Dialogue||Sun Haven was my first assignment, so... Last week I saved Lucia's lunch from a bird. Does that count as heroism?
Dialogue||Hey, XX! I hope your day is as good as mine!
Dialogue||Gorwin mentioned that you have a lot of hobbies.
Dialogue||How do you stay so cheerful?
Dialogue||Oh, yes absolutely! There's too much interesting stuff in this world, and not enough time to do it all.
Dialogue||Something I learned early on is that life is different when you're living on the ground. I can't always be the most helpful since I'm so small, but I <i>can</i> keep a good attitude!
Dialogue||What kind of things?
Dialogue||What's holding you back?
Dialogue||Oh my, there are so many. But my favorites? They have to be reading, fishing, and painting!
Dialogue||It is tricky holding a paintbrush in my mouth, though.
Dialogue||Well, I've just got too many interests to manage in a day. I've been working on a new routine to fit my favorite hobbies in every day!
Dialogue||Oh, and the fact that I don't have any arms yet is... problematic.
Dialogue||That's a lovely perspective.
Dialogue||It still seems like you can't help out much.
Dialogue||That's true in more ways that one, heh! I see things most people miss every day - beetles, worms, funny blades of grass. There's a whole world at your feet!
Dialogue||Maybe so, but thinking that way doesn't help. I hope you can change your perspective, too!
Dialogue||You ever been so far down a mineshaft, you forget which way is up?
Dialogue||Is that what you're wearing for armor? You should upgrade if you're expecting trouble.
Dialogue||How would I upgrade my armor?
Dialogue||Have you seen Elios?
Dialogue||You've got two options. The first is to put work into your smelter and anvil and make it yourself. The second is to bring me the gold to make it for you.
Dialogue||Of course I have. I've lived here all my life, haven't I?
Dialogue||I'll make it myself.
Dialogue||I can't make it as well as you.
Dialogue||Good for you, kid. Don't quit working at it. You only get better with practice, you know.
Dialogue||Not yet you can't. One day, who knows? You only get better with practice, you know.
Dialogue||Are you upset that he didn't give you his blessing?
Dialogue||What did he say to you?
Dialogue||That's not something to get upset about. Making a fuss because you weren't given a gift? That's behaving like a child.
Dialogue||I don't remember it word for word. It was some time back, now.
Dialogue||It might've been, "As a newborn dragon breaks from the egg, your future will be born of flame."
Dialogue||Have to say, he hit the nail on the head with that one.
Dialogue||At night, the stars light up the forest floor.
Dialogue||You won't find goods like these anywhere else.
Dialogue||Pets are animals that live with people. How weird is that!?
Dialogue||Are you lost, or just exploring?
Dialogue||Aw man, you got your own apartment? I'm still living with my m... er, forget I said anything.
Dialogue||What's this? Oh, you again. Elder Gorwin trusts you, so I suppose I should, too.
Dialogue||I appreciate the welcome!
Dialogue||You enjoy being the Elder's assistant, then?
Dialogue||Yes well, again, it's only for Elder Gorwin. If it were up to me, the gates to Nel'Vari would be blocked off for good. Nobody in or out other than Elves.
Dialogue||<i>I</i> prefer the term <i>advisor</i>. I assist the Elder in making decisions that shape the way of life for all Elves in Nel'Vari.
Dialogue||People would still find a way in.
Dialogue||I can't blame you for trying to be safe.
Dialogue||That's no excuse for opening ourselves up to preventable dangers, like yourself. I'm keeping an eye on you, XX.
Dialogue||Hm, you're more reasonable than I expected. I suppose you being here is fine. But I still think we should be more discriminatory about who we allow beyond our gates.
Dialogue||What kind of decisions?
Dialogue||I thought the Elder worked with Nivara?
Dialogue||Oh, decisions managing our resources, ensuring the health of the forest, keeping our people engaged with our culture...
Dialogue||There's a lot to be done here and Elder Gorwin isn't as, let's say, "spry" as he once was.
Dialogue||In a sense, yes. However, I would say Nivara is more of a teacher than a colleague. She's called a Guardian Dragon for a reason, you know.
Dialogue||Lovely bumping into you, XX.
Dialogue||The people in this town are the best... even better when they're having a drink!
Dialogue||The Demon King Minos assigned me to the council himself.
Dialogue||Look who's here! Good to see you again, dear.
Dialogue||Where do you come from?
Dialogue||Have you lived here long?
Dialogue||I propagated in a forest inhabited by Elves. Can you believe it? I had to travel quite a ways to get here, and that's not easy on roots!
Dialogue||Actually, I only arrived a few weeks ago. But already this city has charmed me! I plan to stick around, don't you worry.
Dialogue||You didn't like the forest?
Dialogue||It seems like a forest would be the perfect place for you.
Dialogue||Oh no, I loved that forest. I only outgrew it is all. There's not much to do in the forest, so I suppose I was looking for a little excitement!
Dialogue||Sure, it was nice growing up there. Warm, safe, sweet-scented. Like myself!
Dialogue||I only outgrew it is all. There's not much to do in the forest, so I suppose I was looking for a little excitement!
Dialogue||I wasn't worried.
Dialogue||I'm glad you decided to stay.
Dialogue||Oh, well yes that's obvious. You don't need to be so direct about it, though.
Dialogue||I simply had to. Withergate is perfect for my business. Not many other places you find never ending darkness!
Dialogue||Did you know I'm the fastest runner in Nel'Vari? Well, except for the Centaurs. <i>Nobody</i> is faster than a Centaur.
Dialogue||I was taught that the strong watch over the vulnerable. Though, I'm not quite sure if that's how it works here.
Dialogue||I like to train as much as possible just to be sure I'm up to snuff.
Dialogue||Up for a cup?
Dialogue||Have you met Donovan? For an Amari, he's alright. Good to share travel stories with.
Dialogue||Flex with me!!
Dialogue||If you need help, you know where to find us.
Dialogue||All this sunlight is doing wonders for my leaves.
Dialogue||Does my hair look shiny right now? I want it to look shiny.
Dialogue||You must be here to judge my power as an enchantress, right?
Dialogue||I wouldn't judge you - you're just a kid.
Dialogue||What do you want to do with enchanting?
Dialogue||Just a kid?? That does it! When I learn enchanting as strong as Iris does it then I'll show you! You just made yourself a lifelong enemy.
Dialogue||I wanna be even stronger than Iris one day. Then I can help the town and be loved by everyone, just like her!
Dialogue||I didn't mean to offend you, miss.
Dialogue||Good luck, kid.
Dialogue||Miss? ... Okay, I forgive you! Being lifelong enemies sounds hard anyways.
Dialogue||I won't need luck to teach you a lesson!
Dialogue||Everyone loves Iris?
Dialogue||So you just want other people to like you?
Dialogue||Of course they do! I think some people are a little scared of her, though.
Dialogue||But not me, she's my hero!
Dialogue||Not just that, but I also want to have cool magic stuff in my house like she does. She's just <i>so cool</i>.
Dialogue||What a lovely evening. I want to watch the sun rise over the castle.
Dialogue||Hello again. I'm glad there's someone in this town who knows my secret. Pretending to be one of the monsterfolk can get tiring.
Dialogue||Does anyone really believe you're not Human?
Dialogue||Why are you pretending you're not Human?
Dialogue||Most people don't bother looking under my big hat. I don't think I could have gotten this far without it.
Dialogue||Didn't I tell you that I'm undercover? I'm actually part of the Great City's governing board... or, I will be once I come back with the evidence that I need.
Dialogue||Maybe nobody cares if you're Human?
Dialogue||That's clever, using your short height to your advantage.
Dialogue||Are you kidding?? Have you seen the monsters here? They would gobble me up in an instant!
Dialogue||Hey - I am not that short!!
Dialogue||But, er, thanks. Yes, it's a good plan. One that will surely pay off soon.
Dialogue||What kind of evidence are you after?
Dialogue||So you're just trying to get a promotion?
Dialogue||I'm here to prove that the monsterfolk are planning to attack the Great City or any other Human town. If I can get that information, then I'm sure to get the promotion I've been after!
Dialogue||Say, you haven't heard anything about an attack, have you? I've been here for a while now and still haven't come up with any evidence...
Dialogue||Not just any promotion, but a promotion to the top! I just need evidence that the monsterfolk are planning to attack the Great City or any other Human town.
Dialogue||Say, you haven't heard anything like that, have you? I've been here for a while now and still haven't come up with any evidence...
Dialogue||If my feet ever get sore, I can just lift off and fly! Until my wings get sore...
Dialogue||I've only read one book about enchanting before. Well, I <i>own</i> one book about enchanting. I haven't read it yet.
Dialogue||I know I look cute, but I mean business!
Dialogue||Not everyone has the patience for fishin'. Me, patience is all I've got.
Dialogue||New stranger! I heard you do farmering. Is that true?
Dialogue||Well, yes I'm a farmer. Why do you ask?
Dialogue||It's pronounced "farming."
Dialogue||Do you grow corn? I like corn a lot!
Dialogue||Bleh, who cares? You sound like Wesley.
Dialogue||I don't grow much corn.
Dialogue||I grow lots of corn!
Dialogue||Aw... What's even the point of farmering then?
Dialogue||Oh, yeah! That's great - I can fly into your corn farm sometimes and have corn!
Dialogue||Who's Wesley?
Dialogue||What's wrong with Wesley?
Dialogue||Wesley is the Elder's assistant. He's always talking about proper. Talk proper, stand proper - who cares? Not me!
Dialogue||He's always talking about proper. Talk proper, stand proper - who cares? Not me!
Dialogue||I'm glad we're not travelling anymore. Nel'Vari is fun!
Dialogue||It's a bit dark in Withergate, but I don't mind!
Dialogue||Why don't you mind the darkness?
Dialogue||Do you like living here?
Dialogue||I'm a Naga, can't you tell? You know that we all lived underground for centuries, right?
Dialogue||It was even darker down there, and a waste of time if you ask me!
Dialogue||It's great!! The people here are accepting of everyone, once you get to know them. I haven't seen a city like this anywhere before - it's a revolutionary community!
Dialogue||You must like the surface better than underground.
Dialogue||You seem so positive!
Dialogue||You have no idea! Underground was <i>totally</i> dark. Even if Withergate is eternally dark, there's still so much light and, more importantly, so much to do!
Dialogue||I'm making up for lost time! I want everyone to see all the hard work I've put into my muscles.
Dialogue||Are you with me, XX? Let's pose!
Dialogue||More cities could learn from Withergate.
Dialogue||Withergate is dangerous.
Dialogue||I feel the same way! Can you imagine if every city in the world was like this one? We could have world peace in no time!
Dialogue||What do you mean, dangerous how? Should I be concerned? These muscles are just for show, you know!
Dialogue||This town isn't a bad place to spend eternity!
Dialogue||Hello, little farmer.
Dialogue||Oh - you look sick! Could it be a lovebug?
Dialogue||What's the farthest you've traveled for work?
Dialogue||Have you found a partner for yourself?
Dialogue||I once took a boat down to the Southern Islands. Talk about a good time!
Dialogue||The people down there are some of the most romantic I've ever met.
Dialogue||Unfortunately, my lifestyle keeps me from setting down roots. But believe me, there have been offers!
Dialogue||I'm sure you fit right in, then.
Dialogue||They probably didn't need your help, then.
Dialogue||Oh yeah, I don't know if I've ever sold as much as I did down there. I was out of merchandise in a week!
Dialogue||Don't underestimate how good I am at my job, sweetie.
Dialogue||No surprise there!
Dialogue||Offers? Here in Sun Haven?
Dialogue||Are you practicing your lines? Because that was a good one!
Dialogue||Well sure, just the other day... actually, I better not. Nobody likes a gossip!
Dialogue||I'm not supposed to brag but Wesley says I have the best manners, hehehe.
Dialogue||If I get lost, I use the stars to find my way home!
Dialogue||... I get lost a lot.
Dialogue||Who's that? A new face in Nel'Vari, eh? I remember when the new face was mine!
Dialogue||I'm XX. What's your name?
Dialogue||Oh I'm Clemmett. I'm sure you'll like it here. The Elves are very welcoming!
Dialogue||How's my tail look? I used a new brush today.
Dialogue||Hiya XX!
Dialogue||Another gorgeous day in Nel'Vari...
Dialogue||Huh? No no, it's <i>Clemmett</i> with a "C-L" in front.
Dialogue||I'm just glad to be a part of this town.
Dialogue||Hey again, welcome back! Something I can do for you, XX?
Dialogue||How did you end up in Nel'Vari?
Dialogue||Ah, you mean because I'm not an Elf, right? I guess no matter how hard I try, I'll never quite blend in.
Dialogue||Even if I wish I were an Elf, I'm Amari. I've lived in this forest for years and years, so it was only a matter of time before I found my way into Nel'Vari.
Dialogue||Me? Oh I work odd jobs. Really I'm just trying to do my part and earn my place. The Elder says I don't need to work so hard, but I know he's just being nice!
Dialogue||Why do you want to be an Elf?
Dialogue||The Elves welcomed you, too?
Dialogue||Life as an Elf seems peaceful. Living as an Amari in the forest is too dangerous these days. I just want a group of friends behind me is all.
Dialogue||Sure they did! The Elves are too considerate to kick me out. Besides, I have this job set up now. I'm basically a local, even if nobody else says so.
Dialogue||A good work ethic is always respectable.
Dialogue||Sounds like you need to relax.
Dialogue||That's what I'm saying! As long as I'm working hard, I know I have a place here.
Dialogue||Huh? I don't think you understand what I'm saying.
Dialogue||Nobody will say I haven't done my part!
Dialogue||3, 4... darn, I'm missing a button.
Dialogue||You said your name is XX, didn't you? I see you're not from around here. How exciting!
Dialogue||So you're interested in the world outside of Nel'Vari?
Dialogue||What's that mask for?
Dialogue||I definitely am. I know not all Elves agree with it, but exploring outside of Nel'Vari is my favorite thing to do. I've never gone very far though.
Dialogue||Wesley likes to remind everyone of how dangerous it can be out there. I like to remind everyone that Wesley is a complete wimp!
Dialogue||Oh, this helps me stay safe while collecting material for my clothes. There are some creatures in the forest that aren't very kind, you know.
Dialogue||I wear a mask so they think I'm just another animal. They usually leave me alone.
Dialogue||You should challenge yourself to explore further.
Dialogue||That's pretty mean.
Dialogue||I guess you would know what it's like out there, huh? Well, that settles it! If you think it's safe enough, then I don't see any reason not to see for myself.
Dialogue||Thanks for that! Sometimes I just need a little push. I think most people here could, too.
Dialogue||Mm, it's only kind of mean. Besides, Wesley wouldn't do anything about it. If he did, then I might change my mind about him!
Dialogue||That's really clever.
Dialogue||Usually?
Dialogue||Being clever is how we Elves have survived in this forest more than a hundred years. That, and Nivara of course.
Dialogue||It only happened once, but I got too close to a leafie and it must have smelled me. Soon, I was facing a whole rustle of leafies!
Dialogue||They're small, so it was fine until one of those big ones showed up. I had never seen one up close before - it was pretty amazing!
Dialogue||I bet I have something that would suit you nicely!
Dialogue||I only opened up shop a week ago. I'm so much busier now - running a business is a lot of work!
Dialogue||Hello, hello! I have plenty of handmade Elven clothing for sale. Or, are you not a customer?
Dialogue||I'm just saying hi. My name is XX, it's great to meet you!
Dialogue||Oh, sorry about that! I've been told I can be a bit too pushy with my sales.
Dialogue||My name is Kimi, and it's wonderful to meet you.
Dialogue||Sometimes I go out with Tornn to collect silk. It's safer going out in a group.
Dialogue||When the wind turns, I can hear the mushroom band from here.
Dialogue||I wonder what would happen if I took a walk to Sun Haven...
Dialogue||All this doing nothing is making me hungry!
Dialogue||Wow... I can't believe it! I just saw you and thought, "I'm MARRIED to this person!"
Dialogue||How does it feel?
Dialogue||Did you think you'd ever get married?
Dialogue||It's weird! It's weird, right? Or am I blowing this out of proportion?
Dialogue||It definitely wasn't in the plan. Then again, I didn't really have a plan, either. So I guess if there never was a plan... at least it wasn't against the plan?
Dialogue||It's definitely weird.
Dialogue||I don't think it's weird at all.
Dialogue||I'm glad you think so, too. At least it's weird together, right?
Dialogue||I guess it's different for someone like me. Settling down feels weird. That's what people call it, right? We're "settling down?"
Dialogue||I love your logic.
Dialogue||That makes no sense.
Dialogue||Hah, if you can call it that! It works for me, anyway. I've made some of my best decisions using flawed logic. Like marrying you!
Dialogue||I know the logic is flawed, but at least try to stay with me here.
Dialogue||Demons and ghosts are normal around here, but someone from Sun Haven? That's new! I'm Donovan, by the way.
Dialogue||Hey Donovan, I'm XX. Wait, how can you tell that I'm from Sun Haven?
Dialogue||It's written all over your face. See, on your forehead right there, it says "Kick me, I'm from Sun Haven."
Dialogue||Just messing with you, XX! I saw you come in from the sewer entrance. That only goes to Sun Haven, so it wasn't hard to figure out.
Dialogue||You wanna hear something weird? I haven't felt bored in... well, the longest time ever!
Dialogue||What have you been doing to keep from getting bored?
Dialogue||Why is that so weird, anyway?
Dialogue||I can't really explain it, but I haven't been doing anything different at all. Even if I'm at home alone for a few hours, I'm just... relaxed?
Dialogue||Ugh, I'm starting to bore myself now.
Dialogue||I always thought boredom was like failing yourself. I mean, if I can't even keep <i>myself</i> interested then how am I supposed to be interesting to other people?
Dialogue||You're becoming a boring person!
Dialogue||Maybe you're just more content now.
Dialogue||No way! I would sniff the Moon Dragon's <i>butt</i> before I let that happen!
Dialogue||Content, huh? Eh, I guess. Sounds a little too similar to "boring" but maybe it's not as bad.
Dialogue||Who knows? This could be a turning point for me!
Dialogue||You're always interesting to me, Donovan.
Dialogue||You worry too much about how other people see you.
Dialogue||You've got a point. If I can keep you interested, then who cares about anyone else?
Dialogue||Oh, except Arianella. I need her to like me so she'll teach me how to sew. I tear holes in a lot of my clothes...
Dialogue||Most people would have given up on this city right away, but not you. That's how I knew you were an adventurer.
Dialogue||Hey XX! I'm short on time today so if you wanna talk, better make it snappy.
Dialogue||It's been a while since we hung out, just the two of us.
Dialogue||I never asked - what's the story with your tags?
Dialogue||Hey, you're right. I would totally meet up with you again!
Dialogue||You mean my necklace? No real story. I thought it would be funny to wear them. You know, since I'm half-dog. And... they're dog tags. See? Funny!
Dialogue||I'm going to go ahead and call this a date right away.
Dialogue||It's better if we don't.
Dialogue||Haha! XX, you're so weird. Sure, it's a date then. Meet me at the manhole by the apartment building by 12:00 tomorrow. I've already got ideas!
Dialogue||Suit yourself. I'll have more fun on my own, anyway.
Dialogue||I don't get it.
Dialogue||Hah! That is funny!
Dialogue||My jokes are wasted on the likes of you...
Dialogue||Finally, someone gets me!
Dialogue||I am sure glad I ended up in Sun Haven. Watching you kids bringing this town together... it warms my heart.
Dialogue||Yo, XX. Did I ever tell you about that time I stumbled across an entire yeti skeleton up in the north? I had bones for a whole week! Good times.
Dialogue||Aren't yetis also monsters?
Dialogue||You... ate the bones?
Dialogue||You mean like, monsterfolk? Nah, not at all. They're wild beasts, but their bones sure are tasty.
Dialogue||Well, I chewed 'em up pretty good. I mean, they were just laying there, ya know? I assumed it was a 'first come, first serve' kind of thing.
Dialogue||Hey, if I see a bone, I'm going to chew a bone! I'd rather do what I want rather than miss out.
Dialogue||What makes a bone tasty?
Dialogue||What kind of bone is your favorite?
Dialogue||You know, I never thought about it before. I like yeti bones because they're nice and hard. Almost like rocks. So, maybe it's that?
Dialogue||Bones taste better if they're more like rocks? I actually have no idea, now that I think about it.
Dialogue||Well... okay, I'll tell you this, but you can't tell anyone else, alright?
Dialogue||Honestly, I love dragon bones! I've only had them a couple of times. Wild dragons, of course. But you know how everyone around here is with loving Dynus, and all.
Dialogue||You give into your instinct too easily.
Dialogue||Whatever. At least you had fun.
Dialogue||Just because I don't deny the part of me that's a wolf doesn't mean I "give into it." There's a difference, XX. You just gotta stop being so stuck up.
Dialogue||And isn't that the important thing, XX? Make sure you make plenty of memories, and no regrets!
Dialogue||Oh hey XX... Huh? Oh, hey XX...
Dialogue||Sorry, I'm a bit sleepy. I found a job and barely got any rest yesterday.
Dialogue||A job? So you actually work?
Dialogue||You look really tired. What were you doing yesterday?
Dialogue||Work? I try not to! I just do odd jobs when they come up, and when I need money. And if some treasure happens to cross my path, you can bet I'll take it. A dog's gotta eat, you know.
Dialogue||I'm fine. I was just looking for griffon eggs is all. There's a man who sells them as pets, but someone robbed him of his nest. So, I went out looking for them.
Dialogue||I couldn't find them, so I'm going to go back out there tomorrow. It's a shame what happened to this guy.
Dialogue||You just sound lazy.
Dialogue||Sounds like you have some real fun!
Dialogue||Just because I don't have a regular job doesn't mean I'm not active. Those Humans in Sun Haven are so focused on their jobs, it's unhealthy.
Dialogue||You're right about that. Hey, I'll take you out sometime - we would have a blast!
Dialogue||Can I help?
Dialogue||That's horrible!
Dialogue||Sure, if you're up for it. I tracked the thief to the southern part of town, but I lost the scent. Come find me if you get the eggs back!
Dialogue||Yeah, there are some scummy people in this city. Not many, but a few. I'm glad you seem to be one of the good ones.
Dialogue||I used to be a hero, too. Back in my golden days.
Dialogue||Man, I'm tired. The castle held some big royal parade after midnight the other day. Imagine, the castle guards all stomping down the streets non-stop!
Dialogue||My sewer was shaking the whole time, and it took forever to get to sleep!
Dialogue||A military parade sounds out of place for Withergate.
Dialogue||How did you finally get to sleep?
Dialogue||Oh, trust me, everyone pretty much feels the same way. No one really wants to watch a big, boring parade of armored stiffs walk up and down the streets.
Dialogue||I figured I'd wait it out, at first. But they never stopped. Finally I just went out into the forest and found a good log to snooze on.
Dialogue||It's been awhile since I slept outside and I thought that would be as good a reason to as any.
Dialogue||What's the point of a parade?
Dialogue||Minos probably likes flaunting his power.
Dialogue||I guess it was to "celebrate Withergate's sovereignty," whatever that means. It sounds like a bunch of goblin cake to me.
Dialogue||Just the king flexing his power, and keeping me awake!
Dialogue||See, that's what I said! The parade was supposed to "celebrate Withergate's sovereignty", whatever that means.
Dialogue||Like you said, though, it was just the king showing off his power, and keeping me awake!
Dialogue||Desperate times call for Donovan solutions.
Dialogue||Maybe you'd have slept better if you had an apartment.
Dialogue||Whoa, that's an awesome saying! Did you get that from me? I feel like I've said that before. I'm using it from now on, either way.
Dialogue||Thanks for cheering me up after that obnoxious parade.
Dialogue||One night of ruined sleep versus paying rent... let me see...
Dialogue||Yeah, your idea is no good, XX. I'll take my chances with the parades.
Dialogue||More people should experience a wanderer's lifestyle.
Dialogue||Just because we're married doesn't mean I'll start wearing a collar or anything.
Dialogue||After living here for thirty years, I can tell you this for sure - Sun Haven never gets dull.
Dialogue||Thirty years is a long time.
Dialogue||What's your favorite memory from your time here?
Dialogue||I know, I'm an old geezer. I don't mind one bit! I've got a lot of experience to lean on.
Dialogue||The best day of my life was the day I met my wife Judith. I was still new in Sun Haven, and she smiled at me from across the town square. Took my breath away!
Dialogue||Have any advice for someone like me?
Dialogue||What has your experience taught you?
Dialogue||Hm, I guess if I've learned anything in my time... Don't eat a bowl of spiced beans before getting into a suit of armor.
Dialogue||That's so romantic!
Dialogue||Sounds like you've lived a pretty boring life.
Dialogue||Every day I'm thankful that we met so early. It's been paradise ever since.
Dialogue||Is this how the youth treats their elders now? What a shame...
Dialogue||Sophistication is in short supply in Sun Haven, but that doesn't mean we mustn't try.
Dialogue||I wonder how many more people can fit inside this city? Hopefully, a lot!
Dialogue||Wherever you come from, you've found home now. Trust me, you'll never want to leave this place.
Dialogue||Hey, XX. You're an honest person, right? Well, do I... stink?
Dialogue||You want me to smell you?
Dialogue||What in the world makes you ask?
Dialogue||Yeah, yeah. Just, uh, you know. Take a good whiff of me. What do I smell like to you?
Dialogue||Look, us wolf Amari have excellent senses of smell. Like right now, I can smell the dirt on your boots. It's actually nice, one of the things I love about you, really.
Dialogue||But I have been informed, incorrectly, that I <i>smell</i> like I live in a sewer. But if I don't smell it, then there's no way it's true! Which it definitely isn't.
Dialogue||I try not to care what others think of me, but I can't stand it when they say something that isn't true.
Dialogue||You smell like Donovan to me.
Dialogue||You sort of stink.
Dialogue||See! I knew I didn't stink!
Dialogue||You mean I stink good, or I stink bad? I'm okay with stinking good, but please tell me I'm not stinking bad...
Dialogue||Whoever it was, just ignore them.
Dialogue||You have to stop letting it get to you.
Dialogue||Heh. Sure, you're right. Helps to hear you feel the same way, though.
Dialogue||I wanted some support from a friend, not a lecture. Nevermind, I shouldn't have asked in the first place.
Dialogue||Keep an eye out for a shapeshifter, that guy owes me some money.
Dialogue||That Xyla lady was bothering me earlier today. She kept asking if I'd like a job as a city rat catcher. So annoying!
Dialogue||Why would Xyla be asking you about a rat catcher job?
Dialogue||I bet it pays decent, and it'd be a steady gig.
Dialogue||I mean, don't get me wrong. I love a good rat chase now and then. They're small and quick, so it makes it extra rewarding when you catch one of em'.
Dialogue||Xyla seems to think I'd be pretty good at it. As like, a real "profession", I mean. Guess the city is having extra trouble with the rats these days, and all.
Dialogue||Maybe. But the last thing I'm worried about is stuff like that. I'd have to work every day, report to some 'boss' and worst of all, I'd be on the prince's payroll!
Dialogue||And all for what? Some extra change in my pocket? I wanna chase rats when I feel like chasing rats, not because it's my obligation. No way.
Dialogue||What do you do with a rat when you catch it?
Dialogue||The idea of you chasing rats is hilarious.
Dialogue||See, that's the thing! I like to let the little guys go. Rat doesn't taste very good, so I see no sense in harming them. Xyla would want me to 'get rid' of the rats, though.
Dialogue||Yeah yeah, big bad Donovan the rat chaser, I know. But don't knock it until you try it. It's all sorts of fun, not to mention good exercise.
Dialogue||I even let the rats go when I catch them, don't see a point in hurting them. Xyla would want me to 'get rid' of the rats, though.
Dialogue||Keeping the dream alive. I can appreciate that.
Dialogue||A job would give you some possibilities, though.
Dialogue||Heheh, thanks, XX. I knew you'd understand. You're usually working everyday and I can understand that. We're just two different people in that way.
Dialogue||Cool to have someone who's different, but understands. Rare in this world, for sure.
Dialogue||Ew, a pep talk. No thanks. Maybe some people need those kinds of "possibilities" in their lives, but I sure don't. I thought you of all people knew that.
Dialogue||Albert is my husband. We've been married 32 years.
Dialogue||I just hope the next generation doesn't forget how to have fun. All I hear is serious talk these days.
Dialogue||Phew! That sewer water smell sticks around!
Dialogue||You look spry. In my youth, I was an unmatched gymnast. Really, that's true!
Dialogue||You look like a real go-getter. It's good that the old farm fell to someone like you.
Dialogue||Do you know who owned the farm before me?
Dialogue||Sure do, they were a workhorse too. Also, a dear friend to Judith and me. He left out of the blue about ten years ago.
Dialogue||I'm a knight of the Queen's court, of course!
Dialogue||It's tough when friends leave.
Dialogue||That seems questionable.
Dialogue||Yes, it is.
Dialogue||Thanks for talking, farmer. Not everyone has time for us old geezers in this fast-paced world, heh.
Dialogue||I would never question that man's honor. He was as decent as anyone.
Dialogue||Wait, what queen?
Dialogue||No way, that's so exciting!
Dialogue||Just a joke, youngster. I laid my sword up some time ago. Besides, Sun Haven never even had a queen!
Dialogue||This ring is easily the most expensive thing I own.
Dialogue||It's my favorite outsider! Heh, just kidding. You're a real local by now.
Dialogue||Something on your mind?
Dialogue||You never talk about family. Have you got any family in town?
Dialogue||Donovan, have you ever been in a serious relationship?
Dialogue||My family has been out of the picture for a while... But not like that! No, they're alive. I mean, I assume they're alive. They just live far away from here.
Dialogue||The longest relationship I've ever had was with an old friend named Addy.
Dialogue||It wasn't romantic or anything, I just owed them a lot of money.
Dialogue||If they saw you now, I bet they'd be proud.
Dialogue||Don't you want to see them?
Dialogue||That's a nice thing to say, XX. I'm starting to think you really are a great friend - and not just as a joke!
Dialogue||Funny, you kind of sound like them. It's making my feet itch!
Dialogue||Did you pay them back?
Dialogue||That's not exactly what I meant...
Dialogue||Sort of. I saved their life when a crate almost fell on top of them, knocked 'em out of the way. Crate was full of gemstones though, so we split the gems and called it even.
Dialogue||Hey, that really is the most serious relationship I've been in. You asked, I answered. That's all I can do!
Dialogue||Who's that? Say, I don't recognize your face.
Dialogue||My name's XX. I'm the new farmer here.
Dialogue||Oh, the farmer! That's right Lucia told us there was someone moving in there.
Dialogue||It's good to meet you, my name is Judith.
Dialogue||I hope you forgive me when I forget our anniversary...
Dialogue||Did you say there's a beach near you? Man, I miss the beach...
Dialogue||You say there's a feline Amari in Sun Haven? I wonder if we would get along...
Dialogue||I have friends all over the world, and maybe some enemies too.
Dialogue||Hey XX! You're looking real good today - don't change!
Dialogue||How long have we been together now? I'm already forgetting what it was like being without you!
Dialogue||We've both changed a lot. Just wait until I get you eating healthy.
Dialogue||Do you miss running around without any attachments?
Dialogue||I don't really know what eating "healthy" means, but I always feel good after eating a lot of meat. I especially love a big steak.
Dialogue||If it makes me feel good, that's got to mean it's healthy. Right?
Dialogue||If you're asking whether or not I miss being single - without you - then it's a big fat NO. Sometimes I think about running off somewhere, but that's just animal instinct.
Dialogue||When it comes down to it, I really love being with you, XX.
Dialogue||You know you need vegetables too, right?
Dialogue||That's... not right. But I can help you with your diet!
Dialogue||... Why would you say something like that? Don't even joke, XX.
Dialogue||Hm... All right, I trust you. But I won't stop eating meat! I need it. For my soul, which is in my stomach.
Dialogue||Good, because I don't like the idea of you running around who-knows-where.
Dialogue||If you ever feel the need to run off somewhere, don't stop on my account.
Dialogue||Whoa, slow down XX. I'm not going to stop my outings just because we're together. That would change who I am entirely, which is just not going to happen.
Dialogue||And that's why you're the only one for me, XX. You let me be myself. But part of being a wolf is having a pack, and it feels really good to have one now.
Dialogue||Back in my prime I could have solved this “monster town” problem overnight!
Dialogue||XX... You're staring at my dog parts. I don't really care, but if you have a question then just ask. No need to be all... starey.
Dialogue||Sorry... Is it hard to wear hats with those wolf ears?
Dialogue||I've been holding onto this for a long time - you have a really great tail.
Dialogue||Ha ha, you're a real clown, XX. I can wear hats just fine... probably. Come to think of it, I've never actually tried before. Are my ears that big?
Dialogue||Hey, thanks! I try to keep it clean. I'm pretty proud of it. But sometimes it causes more trouble than it's worth.
Dialogue||They really are.
Dialogue||I think it's cute!
Dialogue||Whatever, I can hear a pin drop on the other side of a crowded room. Who cares if I can't wear dumb hats?
Dialogue||Whatever, I can hear a pin drop on the other side of a crowded room. But, I guess looking cute can be useful too!
Dialogue||What kind of trouble?
Dialogue||I can't tell if you like it or not.
Dialogue||I'm always knocking things over with it or hitting strangers. You'd think I'd get used to it, but sometimes it's like it has a mind of its own...
Dialogue||My life would be easier without it, but I can't deny that it completes my look. Yeah, it's a complicated relationship.
Dialogue||Well, what do you think? Best tail in Withergate? ... Of course the answer is yes!
Dialogue||You're really starting to like Withergate, huh XX? I can see it on your face!
Dialogue||You know, Withergate is actually a nice community.
Dialogue||I wonder what it's like to live in the castle...
Dialogue||I can see that. But I try not to get too involved with community wherever I am. Who knows when I'll need to split, right?
Dialogue||Castle, shmastle. Nobody needs all that space. I get that they're royalty, but... I mean, who cares! Give me a leafy tree to sleep under and I'm happy.
Dialogue||Would you really leave Withergate?
Dialogue||It's good to keep your options open.
Dialogue||Sure, if I had to. But hey, it's not like I'm planning on it or anything. This city has been the best home I've had, maybe ever!
Dialogue||No way - I just said the exact same thing last night! Man XX, you and I really seem to be on the same page these days.
Dialogue||Kings should live in regular houses, like the rest of us.
Dialogue||You wouldn't say that if the prince were here right now.
Dialogue||Oh, that's a great idea. Then we could make the castle into a huge carnival ride. I bet it already looks like a carnival on the inside, too.
Dialogue||Oh man, don't get me started on the prince. That guy really needs to relax!
Dialogue||There's nothing more exciting than a fresh start.
Dialogue||My mother warned me not to marry someone based on looks.
Dialogue||Oh, the farmer. It's so good having you in town.
Dialogue||Have you been in Sun Haven a long time?
Dialogue||Do you have a favorite memory from your life here?
Dialogue||What, why do you ask?
Dialogue||Oh don't worry, I'm only poking fun at you. I know I'm no youngster!
Dialogue||It's been more than thirty years that I've lived here. Most of that time has been with my husband, Albert.
Dialogue||Oh yes, I'm glad you asked! I was a young girl when I first saw Elios. It wasn't on Dragon's Meet, but in the skies above Sun Haven.
Dialogue||A colony of ghasts came out of nowhere, threatening to attack the town. But Elios wouldn't have it! No, he swooped down from his mountaintop and spouted fire until the ghasts fled back north.
Dialogue||It seems like a waste to spend all that time in one place.
Dialogue||A life like that sounds perfectly peaceful.
Dialogue||You have a lot to learn, kiddo. Maybe one day you'll see what it means to make a life for yourself.
Dialogue||It hasn't been perfect, but it has certainly been nice.
Dialogue||Did anyone panic?
Dialogue||Were you scared?
Dialogue||It should have been scary, but I didn't panic one bit. In fact, nobody did. Elios took action, so I felt safe. I would even say that I felt strong knowing he was on my side.
Dialogue||After seeing his power that day, I knew that Sun Haven was one of the safest places in the world. I still believe that to be true.
Dialogue||These days all I want to do is hang with you instead of just doing my own thing. I think you broke me, XX!
Dialogue||You know, I'm surprised you're doing so well in a real relationship.
Dialogue||Is Donovan... losing his edge??
Dialogue||That sounds almost like a compliment, but also kind of like an insult. I know you're not trying to hurt my feelings, right?
Dialogue||What? No way!!
Dialogue||There's nothing wrong with wanting a little time to relax - juuuust a little! But maybe you don't get a lot of time for that, being a farmer. That's rough!
Dialogue||I just mean, it seems like this is new to you.
Dialogue||I'm only saying that I appreciate the effort.
Dialogue||Aw man, is it that obvious? I was trying to play it cool.
Dialogue||Yeah, being in a real relationship is kind of weird for me. But I'm having fun!
Dialogue||I like the hard work.
Dialogue||You're right, it's terrible.
Dialogue||You would say something like that. We have some real different ideas about how to make a living, that's for sure.
Dialogue||But if we're both happy then who cares!
Dialogue||If you hate it that much then you should make a change. Who says you have to be a farmer? Go exploring or... I don't know, fishing or something.
Dialogue||You're looking pretty buff, XX. Is that from farming or fighting?
Dialogue||Either way, keep it up and you'll have nothing to fear in this town!
Dialogue||You seem pretty fearless, but I wonder... what scares you, Donovan?
Dialogue||Is there anybody in town that you would be afraid to fight?
Dialogue||Okay sure, I'll tell you. But only because we're getting to know each other pretty well. And you have to keep it quiet. This is a test to see if I can trust you, XX! Don't blow it.
Dialogue||Hm... Not Darius... Not Xyla... Maybe Arianella, the seamstress... Actually, the only person I can think of is you, XX.
Dialogue||You can trust me.
Dialogue||Out with it already.
Dialogue||I can't swim to save my life. For some reason, I sink like a bag of rocks. I just can't keep my head above water.
Dialogue||Maybe I need to gain some weight or something. Anyway, now you know. So don't tell!
Dialogue||You're right, I would cream you.
Dialogue||I wouldn't want to fight you, Donovan!
Dialogue||Whoa whoa whoa - that's not what I meant at all! Good to know where you stand though, sheesh.
Dialogue||That's exactly my point, I think I actually like you too much. Heck, I'd rather get crushed by the club bouncer than have to fight you.
Dialogue||There's my little farmer! I don't know why, but it's adorable to me that you're a farmer.
Dialogue||Not everyone can live as freely as you do.
Dialogue||My job feeds a lot of people, you know.
Dialogue||Sure they can, it's easy. All I do is take jobs as they come. What's hard about that? People need help with stuff all the time.
Dialogue||I know, you're a total provider! I'm not making fun of you or anything. I just think it's cute.
Dialogue||I don't think it's smart to live without steady work.
Dialogue||People would be happier if they lived like you.
Dialogue||Maybe there's better things in life than being smart. Dating me sure isn't smart, but here you are!
Dialogue||I've been saying that for years! Everyone could stand to loosen up a bit.
Dialogue||I can't tell if you're making fun of me.
Dialogue||I guess I'll take that as a compliment?
Dialogue||Ah, shoot. I don't mean to be a jerk. I just see you making your living and compare it to my life. I guess it's funny how different people's lives are... well, different.
Dialogue||Oh? Are you a new neighbor, or have I just forgotten your name?
Dialogue||My name is XX, I'm the new farmer here.
Dialogue||Of course you are! Well I'm delighted to meet you, XX. Call me Albert, 'cause that's my name!
Dialogue||Seeing how you live your life, I'm starting to get it. Maybe.
Dialogue||It doesn't look so bad, settling in one spot.
Dialogue||Now there's something I never thought I'd hear you say.
Dialogue||Where would you settle down, if you could?
Dialogue||Heh, me either. I guess I'm starting to rethink some things. It's new. And weird. XX, you're making me weird.
Dialogue||The sewer isn't good enough? No actually, you're probably right... I don't really want to spend the rest of my life surrounded by rats. Even if they're fun to scare away.
Dialogue||You're finally growing up.
Dialogue||I couldn't make you any weirder than you already are.
Dialogue||I don't know if you meant it, but hearing that you think I'm childish is pretty brutal.
Dialogue||You're one to talk! You met me in a city that was rumored to be full of "vicious monsters," remember? Only a real weirdo would go looking for a place like that!
Dialogue||You didn't answer the question!
Dialogue||I was hoping you'd say something like that.
Dialogue||I guess if I could choose any place, it would be someplace with a lot of nature. The city is fun and all, but there are too many rules. I need more space.
Dialogue||Actually, a farm wouldn't be half bad.
Dialogue||Withergate is supposed to be a town full of monsters that live in constant darkness! Can you imagine?
Dialogue||... What? Something in my teeth?
Dialogue||Hey XX. It's another beautiful, slow day. I could get used to days like these.
Dialogue||Hey, do you think Xyla would arm wrestle with me?
Dialogue||I don't think that arm wrestling match would end well...
Dialogue||Can we be serious for a sec? Are you happy in our relationship?
Dialogue||Yeah, you're totally right!
Dialogue||Wait do you mean for me, or for her? Whose side are you on, anyway?
Dialogue||Huh? Happy? Yeah, sure. I mean, I'm plenty happy with you.
Dialogue||XX, what's this all about?
Dialogue||Xyla is really scary.
Dialogue||I believe in you, even if you'll obviously lose.
Dialogue||That's... a good point. And exactly why I need to beat her at arm wrestling!
Dialogue||Now THAT'S the kind of support I love to hear from you, XX.
Dialogue||I'm having doubts.
Dialogue||I'm just trying to plan for our future.
Dialogue||Doubts? Well don't string me along, XX. If you're going to leave, just do it. I don't like games like this.
Dialogue||Our future? Oh... Oh! I see what's going on here. You've got a special question to ask me, huh?
Dialogue||I won't pressure you - take your time! Just know that whenever you're ready to ask, I'm ready to answer.
Dialogue||Whoa, hey! I wasn't expecting you just now.
Dialogue||Keep your eyes up, XX. It's hard to keep track of everyone in a crowd.
Dialogue||Keep your chin up. Life is beautiful, even when it's hard.
Dialogue||Do you have any advice for someone like me?
Dialogue||What do you do here, Judith?
Dialogue||I should have expected that - young people are always asking their elders for advice.
Dialogue||Well kiddo, sometimes life guides you and sometimes you guide life. It's never too late to change your course if it feels like you're headed in the wrong direction.
Dialogue||Oh, I'm quite retired now. It's cute you mistook me for a working woman!
Dialogue||Before retirement, I was the town courier. Sun Haven really only needs one courier, so I was happy to pass the torch to Tonya when the time came.
Dialogue||Have you ever felt like you were going the wrong direction?
Dialogue||Is there a story behind that?
Dialogue||Certainly. I failed to make some changes like I should have, but I still ended up in a nice place.
Dialogue||Not one I care to tell right now. Maybe one day, farmer.
Dialogue||I bet people loved you delivering their mail.
Dialogue||Looking at you, I wouldn't have thought you were a courier.
Dialogue||Oh! Hehe, you're not wrong at all!
Dialogue||In fact, I don't think I bought myself a drink in the tavern for twenty years. My friends and neighbors always paid for me! It was a wonderful time.
Dialogue||Perhaps you should judge less with your eyes, farmer.
Dialogue||Hey everyone, my new best friend XX is here!
Dialogue||Eh, nevermind. Nobody's even paying attention.
Dialogue||Who do you hang out with, anyway?
Dialogue||I'm glad you said that. I feel like we're getting to be close friends, too.
Dialogue||There's nobody I like to hang with as much as you, XX. Which reminds me, I've been meaning to ask you out.
Dialogue||Just a hangout with the two of us. What do you say?
Dialogue||That reminds me - hang on - ah, why'd I take it off the chain? Come on...
Dialogue||Aha, got it! Here you go XX, from me to you. It's one of my dogtags!
Dialogue||That would be awesome!
Dialogue||I think I'd rather not.
Dialogue||Great, it's a plan! Meet me tomorrow at the manhole by the apartment building and we'll go from there. Let's say 12:00 pm!
Dialogue||Huh? All right then, my bad.
Dialogue||A gift? For me? From you?
Dialogue||You better not be joking!
Dialogue||Hey, I can do nice things too. Sometimes. Listen, I'm trying to be a good partner here. Just, take this.
Dialogue||That's one of my dog tags. I can't say why, but it's important to me. Don't lose it, okay?
Dialogue||I love your scent. I can smell you a mile away!
Dialogue||Can you really smell me from a mile away?
Dialogue||What's my scent smell like?
Dialogue||Well not an <i>actual</i> mile. It's a figure of speech, I think. But I really do smell you before I see you... I don't know, maybe a couple blocks away?
Dialogue||It's a nice mix of fresh dirt and sweat. And maybe a hint of the beach. Is your farm close to the ocean?
Dialogue||That's not very far.
Dialogue||That's still pretty far!
Dialogue||I'm sorry, I didn't realize my nose was under review. Say, how far does your nose smell?
Dialogue||You think? Heh, thanks! It's not always a good thing though. I can smell Slobert halfway across the city...
Dialogue||Hey, that's pretty good!
Dialogue||I'm right next to the beach, actually.
Dialogue||I love smelling the beach. The closest thing we have here is either the river or the sewer. They just stink. But the beach stinks <i>good.</i>
Dialogue||Yeah, I thought so! I love smelling the beach. The closest thing we have here is either the river or the sewer. They just stink. But the beach stinks <i>good.</i>
Dialogue||I don't see why we can't just head into the forest and make a home somewhere.
Dialogue||Enjoying Withergate? There's always something to do here.
Dialogue||What do you do here in your down time?
Dialogue||So do you like this city a lot?
Dialogue||I talk to people, sniff around, look for something fun. I don't really like having down time, so I try to find something to do as soon as I can.
Dialogue||This place is a great home base when I need one. Lots of good food and new people to talk to. Yeah, it's a nice spot when you've got nowhere else to go.
Dialogue||I agree, I hate wasting a day.
Dialogue||I don't like being busy all the time.
Dialogue||Right? Some people just want to put their feet up, but my feet are restless. You and I are more alike than I thought, XX.
Dialogue||I get it. Taking life slow can be nice, but it's not my style.
Dialogue||There are rumors in Sun Haven that Withergate is a dangerous place.
Dialogue||Have you lived here for a long time?
Dialogue||Those Humans are so funny! Look around and tell me where the danger is. The hat shop? Oh I know, the pet shop! Aw, you're scared of hamsters, how cute.
Dialogue||The Demons only opened the city up to monsterfolk maybe ten years ago. Even though Amari aren't really considered monsterfolk, you can bet I was one of the first ones here.
Dialogue||Come on, a city of darkness? How could I resist!?
Dialogue||Do your friends ask about me? Ooh, tell them I'm a ghost - that would really freak them out!
Dialogue||Hey XX! I'm glad to see you, I was getting pretty bored.
Dialogue||Are you just talking to me because you're bored, or because you like me?
Dialogue||If you're bored, tell me the wildest thing that happened to you last week.
Dialogue||That's a hard question, XX. On the one hand, I'm very bored. On the other, I actually do like you for some reason. I guess I just don't know how to answer the question.
Dialogue||Last week... Oh, you've heard of Elementals? People made of fire or ice or whatever? I was sitting on a rock taking a rest and... Yep, it was an elemental.
Dialogue||This lady was not happy to wake up under my butt, let me tell you. She threw me so far, I landed in a harpy's nest halfway up a tree.
Dialogue||The upside? Harpy omelettes for breakfast the next day!
Dialogue||What do you mean, "for some reason?"
Dialogue||Sounds like you're avoiding the question...
Dialogue||Don't take it the wrong way - I just mean that I usually don't hang around the same people for too long. But I like chatting it up with you.
Dialogue||There's no way that's all true.
Dialogue||Harpy's eggs? I've never had them, but I'll try anything.
Dialogue||Believe it or not, I don't care. I know what happened.
Dialogue||That's the right kind of attitude! Heck, I'll even make you an omelette someday.
Dialogue||You'll like it here, I can already tell.
Dialogue||Judith is my wife. Can you believe it, we've been married 29 years!
Dialogue||Is it just me, or do the guards here look like ninnies?
Dialogue||I've got some running around to do, but I'll definitely see you in town!
Dialogue||I was thinking about hosting a cookout. Maybe some drinks, and a lot of meat roasting over an open fire.
Dialogue||But you live in a sewer. Where would you host a cookout?
Dialogue||What would you serve other than meat?
Dialogue||Good point. Didn't think about that. Well, no biggie. We'll host it right on the streets of Withergate! Everyone's invited! Plenty of drinks, friends and meat. Lots of meat.
Dialogue||What else is there, XX? Meat is like, I dunno, most of what I eat. I don't know much about other types of food, other than I don't like them as much as meat.
Dialogue||I'm just going to focus on doing what I know best. No sense in trying something new and screwing it up.
Dialogue||Where did you get everything for this cookout?
Dialogue||How will you get the invites out?
Dialogue||Yeah, see. That's the thing. I don't have it all yet. Well, more accurately, I don't have any of it yet. But like I said, it's all in the planning stage of things.
Dialogue||Let's dream big and worry logistics later.
Dialogue||Oh that's the easy part. Just mention it to a few of the bats around the city. They blab about everything. Give it a few hours and half the town will know what's going down.
Dialogue||Sounds great, as long as everyone loves meat!
Dialogue||You should give new things a try.
Dialogue||Hey, if they don't like meat then they can go host their <i>own</i> cookout! But Donovan's cookout is serving meat, meat, meat!!
Dialogue||Nah, been there, hated that. I know what I like, XX. Don't try changing that, because I'm not interested.
Dialogue||Am I extra pale? Maybe I've been in darkness too long.
Dialogue||One of my favorite things to do here is just wander the streets.
Dialogue||If you ever get tired of that Human town, there's always room in the sewer!
Dialogue||It's my new favorite person, XX!
Dialogue||Let's talk.
Dialogue||You seem to know this town well. What do you do for fun around here?
Dialogue||So you live here?
Dialogue||I hang around the carnival a lot. I wait for people to lose the games so I can step up and win right afterwards, heheh.
Dialogue||Honestly, how hard is it to knock some bottles down?
Dialogue||Sure, why wouldn't I? It's the city of darkness! What am I going to do, just pass up the chance to live in darkness forever? I don't think so.
Dialogue||Carnival?
Dialogue||That sounds kind of mean.
Dialogue||Don't tell me you haven't been to the carnival yet! Man, you're in for a treat. The food is unhealthy and there are so many people that you can't escape the body odor! You'll love it.
Dialogue||I promise, I'm only mean when it's funny.
Dialogue||Only monsters live in darkness.
Dialogue||Maybe I should try living in the darkness for a while.
Dialogue||Well... yeah. Look around, we're all monsters here. You might want to rethink your view on monsters. Or at least, shut up about it!
Dialogue||Really, you? I would love to see that! You could show the Human town that not everything is scary in the dark.
Dialogue||Hey, I think I can smell the last meal you ate. Did you have... tree bark? Wait no, that must be something else.
Dialogue||You're probably smelling my farm, Donovan.
Dialogue||Why would you want to smell my last meal, anyway?
Dialogue||Yeah, okay that makes a lot of sense. I didn't take you for a tree-eater.
Dialogue||People are usually impressed by that trick. Then again, I also usually get it right. Guess today's not my lucky day, huh?
Dialogue||What's a tree-eater?
Dialogue||Still, your nose is pretty impressive!
Dialogue||Someone who eats trees, obviously. Not that I've ever met anyone who did...
Dialogue||Ah, thanks! I try to keep a sharp sniffer in case of emergencies.
Dialogue||I'm sure it's really impressive when it works!
Dialogue||That's a silly trick anyway.
Dialogue||Heheh, yeah! Maybe I'll try again next time to really impress you.
Dialogue||Huh, you might be right... Maybe it's time to retire that tired old trick.
Dialogue||XX, my sweet. I was thinking of you while painting the other night.
Dialogue||Hey, how come you haven't painted me yet?
Dialogue||Do you have any goals as a painter, Jun?
Dialogue||Oh, um, well... I don't want to lie to you, XX. There's a chance that I already have.
Dialogue||It would be nice to paint a large mural one day. But otherwise, painting is just how I relax. I don't feel the need to put pressure on it with too many big goals. Does that make sense?
Dialogue||That's so thoughtful!
Dialogue||You painted me without telling me? I don't know how I feel about that.
Dialogue||Oh good! I was worried you might be uncomfortable with it.
Dialogue||It was one day that I noticed you in your field with the sun setting behind you, and I was simply inspired.
Dialogue||I'm sorry if that's uncomfortable. One day I noticed you in your field with the sun setting behind you, and I was simply inspired.
Dialogue||I get it - making it competitive would ruin the hobby.
Dialogue||I get it - it's just for yourself, not others.
Dialogue||Some people can't separate their ambitions from their hobbies, which leads them to quit doing something they love just because they don't get recognition.
Dialogue||I'm glad you aren't one of those people, XX.
Dialogue||Hey there, XX. Just stopping by?
Dialogue||Oh, just visiting the best merchant in Sun Haven.
Dialogue||Have you always worked alone?
Dialogue||Didn't I tell you once before that I don't give discounts based on compliments? Heck, I don't give discounts at all.
Dialogue||Aside from my old mentor, nobody's ever worked with me but me.
Dialogue||That just sounds like smart business to me.
Dialogue||That's nothing to be proud of, you know.
Dialogue||It's easy to be smart about your business when you work alone. No coworkers to disagree with you, and no splitting profits!
Dialogue||Whatever, it's decisions like that that helped me rise to the top.
Dialogue||It must be easier working alone.
Dialogue||It must be a challenge working alone.
Dialogue||Eh, depends on the business. I planned for my own success - as you can see - so being alone is what works best for me.
Dialogue||Sometimes I consider taking on a partner, but then I count my money and forget about it.
Dialogue||Taking good care of your weapons, XX?
Dialogue||Asking about my weapons is a bit random for you, Wornhardt.
Dialogue||What about you? Do you take good care of your stuff?
Dialogue||Haha, it is, isn't it? But the best medicine is preventative. When you're out there putting yourself in harm's way, your first "medicine" is your armor and weapons.
Dialogue||So keep them in good condition, and stay safe out there for me!
Dialogue||Fair question! To answer it, of course I do. I always make sure to have fresh scalpels and needles on hand! Only the sharpest, for best results.
Dialogue||I never want to put in less than maximum effort in what I do. Anything less is selling the people I care about short.
Dialogue||You've got it, doctor!
Dialogue||I'll be fine, don't worry so much.
Dialogue||I try not to overstep when it comes to telling my patients how to live their lives, but I do want to make sure everyone is taking care of themselves.
Dialogue||Thanks for understanding, XX!
Dialogue||Please don't think I'm nagging you, XX. I'm just worried about your health and safety.
Dialogue||You sure think two steps ahead.
Dialogue||That does make a lot of sense.
Dialogue||Hey, I tell Solon to never overdo it with his blacksmithing. I always remind Anne to lift her boxes and crates with the legs, not the back.
Dialogue||The best way to cure an injury is to not have it in the first place!
Dialogue||Your smile is bright as the sun, XX. I hope your day has been good so far!
Dialogue||I only smile like this when I see you!
Dialogue||Are you happy in our relationship, Wornhardt?
Dialogue||You're such a cheeseball! I've actually heard of studies done on smiles. The idea is, people who smile more are healthier and live longer.
Dialogue||Am I... XX, I'm the happiest I've been! If we were stuck together for the rest of our lives, it wouldn't be long enough!
Dialogue||Oh, heh. I didn't mean to suggest anything by that...
Dialogue||If that's true, then we're going to live a looong time.
Dialogue||That doesn't sound very scientific.
Dialogue||I'll have to make sure you get your daily dose!
Dialogue||Maybe not. I honestly can't vouch for the credibility of the study, but it's a fun thought anyway.
Dialogue||Can you imagine if I wrote a prescription for smiles?
Dialogue||I could spend the rest of my life with you, too.
Dialogue||It's difficult for me to picture anything lasting that long...
Dialogue||I don't mean to ruin the moment, but we are talking about marriage, right? Sometimes I can be a bit oblivious to social cues, heh.
Dialogue||In any case, I'm ready whenever you're ready.
Dialogue||Oh, sure, I see. Maybe you're not ready to take that step, XX - and that's fine. But whenever you are... I'll be here.
Dialogue||You'll have an easy time getting to know Sun Haven, XX, I just know it.
Dialogue||It's about time I learned something about farming, don't you think?
Dialogue||It's nice having a new neighbor. I hope you like playing games!
Dialogue||What is your favorite thing about living here?
Dialogue||I bet you know a lot about Sun Haven. What should I know?
Dialogue||I like that I live right next to Pod. It makes playtime easier. Lucia is real pretty, too.
Dialogue||Oh, don't tell anyone I said that!
Dialogue||The beach is the best place to find seashells. I have the biggest collection in town!
Dialogue||I'm going to tell!
Dialogue||I won't tell.
Dialogue||Noooo! We won't be friends if you do!
Dialogue||Oh good... My friends would never stop making fun if they found out.
Dialogue||What do you do with them?
Dialogue||I'm going to make an even bigger collection!
Dialogue||Oh, nothing I guess. They're just pretty, is all.
Dialogue||Yeah right - you're on!
Dialogue||How are you today, XX?
Dialogue||How are <i>you</i> doing, Jun?
Dialogue||I've been busy with... farmer things.
Dialogue||Oh, hah. Caught me off guard for a second. I'm so used to asking how everyone else is doing that I never stop to think about myself.
Dialogue||I'm actually doing just fine, thank you for asking. I love asking others how they're doing, but it's good to be asked myself every once in awhile.
Dialogue||From what I can tell, "farmer things" seems to be all sorts of stuff! It's actually amazing, everything you seem to do.
Dialogue||I like to think a little bit of your energy has rubbed off on everyone.
Dialogue||Keep up the good spirits, Sun Haven relies on you!
Dialogue||This counselor stuff seems like a breeze.
Dialogue||Don't I know it. It's a big task, but it's one I'm glad to take up. Positive reinforcement like yours makes it all the easier, though. So thanks for that, really.
Dialogue||There's much more to being a counselor than just asking how someone is doing, XX.
Dialogue||I appreciate you asking me how I'm doing, but please don't go off and try to give people counseling...
Dialogue||I'm glad to help Sun Haven.
Dialogue||I suppose I haven't noticed.
Dialogue||I'm sure you are! It's good our town has so many dedicated people living in it. Maybe we aren't as big as the Great City, but we have a lot of heart.
Dialogue||It's why I like to keep up to date on everyone and see how they're doing.
Dialogue||Well, you're always pretty busy so there's nothing odd about that. It's my job to keep up with everyone on their day-to-day feelings, though.
Dialogue||It's why I like to catch up with people and see how they're doing.
Dialogue||XX, listen listen! Last night I had a dream that was the most strangest dream ever. I wasn't Kitty at all, but a Human!
Dialogue||A Human? That is weird.
Dialogue||Do you have many dreams like that?
Dialogue||It felt so strange! No claws, no reflexes, no smells. I don't know how Humans live every day like that, nyaan!
Dialogue||Not so many like that, nya. I do have dreams though! My favorite is when I'm flying in the air, and then I catch the birdies right out of the sky!
Dialogue||Was there anything about it that you liked?
Dialogue||At least it was only for a night!
Dialogue||Well, my ears didn't itch so much. Did you know my ears get so so itchy all the time, nya? When the wind messes up my fur, it itches - itchy itchy!
Dialogue||True true! If Kitty had to be that way all the time... I don't even like to think about it, nyan!
Dialogue||That sounds like fun!
Dialogue||Poor birds!
Dialogue||The next time you dream about flying, you should try to catch a birdie too! Then tell Kitty aaaallll about it, nya!
Dialogue||Nyan? They're not real, silly XX.
Dialogue||Kitty doesn't hurt animals in real life. Except maybe fish for dinner...
Dialogue||Hello. Having a good day I hope?
Dialogue||I'm almost out of debt, you know. If I can do it, anyone can!
Dialogue||You feeling okay, XX? You're looking a little green. Hey wait... Nevermind - it was a trick of the light.
Dialogue||Ah XX, the cold night air is refreshing, yes?
Dialogue||The darkness is quite invigorating.
Dialogue||The Moon Dragon's power has made a wonderful community here.
Dialogue||Yes, quite so. It makes me feel like I could build or raze a castle all on my own.
Dialogue||When my people were forced to endure sunlight we were severely limited in what we could get done, especially when it came to securing our city.
Dialogue||It's true that we owe our gratitude to Dynus, though debt to a dragon isn't truly something I relish.
Dialogue||Thank goodness for Withergate's darkness, then.
Dialogue||That all seems a problem of the past, at least.
Dialogue||Hm, yes. Fortunate, though it is not something to rely on forever. Until my family holds the key to eternal darkness for themselves, that is.
Dialogue||It is. But complacency is the death of power, XX. I won't rest until my hold on power is absolute, but you knew that.
Dialogue||Do you believe you could achieve darkness without Dynus's magic?
Dialogue||Don't you think you'll always be indebted to Dynus?
Dialogue||Dragons are large, XX. But the world is far larger. If Dynus is capable of creating eternal darkness, then why can't I find the same power somewhere out there? Perhaps someday...
Dialogue||The thought of that brings the taste of steel to my mouth... One day, I will sever our reliance to the Moon Dragon.
Dialogue||I'm trying to organize a big sale and here you are, trying to flirt with me! You're lucky I love it.
Dialogue||Honestly, it's not the biggest ring I've ever seen. But it's certainly the most meaningful - because it's from you.
Dialogue||Are you getting to know the town very well? You'll learn your way around just like I did when I was new here.
Dialogue||Where are you from, anyway?
Dialogue||Do you ever miss your hometown?
Dialogue||I grew up in the Great City as an army baby - my mom was a captain when she adopted me. Obviously, I followed in her footsteps.
Dialogue||Sometimes, but that's the life of a soldier. I'll be comfortable when I'm old and wrinkled, but for now I'll do my part. Duty through service!
Dialogue||Is she the whole reason you chose a military career?
Dialogue||It makes sense that you would become a soldier, too.
Dialogue||I don't know if that's entirely why, but it's definitely part of it. Growing up in a military house was tough, but it gave me the backbone to carry myself forward.
Dialogue||Also, it keeps me in really great shape!
Dialogue||I'm glad you think so. Sometimes I wonder if I did it only to make my mom proud, but then I remember how much I really like the job and I quit thinking about it.
Dialogue||You're a great soldier. I'm sure you'll be promoted in no time!
Dialogue||I could never live a life of subservience like that.
Dialogue||Thanks! I know it would make my mom proud to see me rank up a bit... Then again, she knows firsthand that it's a long climb to the top.
Dialogue||I'm not asking you to agree with it, but I will ask you to respect it. The soldiers of the Great Army put themselves at risk for your safety every day.
Dialogue||I love my big ol' wheat field. I've got it so easy, wheat is so simple to grow! Nothing like your work, I'm sure, XX.
Dialogue||Do you ever have trouble keeping up with your field?
Dialogue||It's amazing that you grow and mill your own flour.
Dialogue||Nope, not really. The first few years it was rough controlling the weeds, but after working the soil enough they don't get too bad anymore.
Dialogue||You think so, XX? Heh, I mostly just like that it cuts down on ordering from someone else. Business deals are always so formal and serious, it's really awkward for me.
Dialogue||Harvesting must be a pain, though.
Dialogue||It's a pretty well-kept field.
Dialogue||Well, that's certainly not the easiest. Emma and Elizabeth both can't wait to get old enough to help, though! They're the best.
Dialogue||Oh shoot, XX, you really think that? That would mean a lot coming from anyone, but you're a farmer! So it's extra meaningful.
Dialogue||You can't expect to run a business if you can't handle that kind of stuff.
Dialogue||You do what you gotta do to get by, no judging.
Dialogue||When you put it that way, it really makes me seem like I'm just avoiding my problems. Ugh, time for a walk, maybe...
Dialogue||Heh, thanks. I always feel silly saying it out loud, but I'm glad you understand how I feel. It makes me feel... less silly about it.
Dialogue||The day always improves when I bump into you, XX.
Dialogue||What do you want to talk about?
Dialogue||Feel free not to answer, but do you ever feel held back by your title?
Dialogue||You always seem so in control. How do you do it?
Dialogue||I don't mind, XX. In some ways, being Archmage is indeed a restriction. I do everything as a representative of our town, so I have to be careful.
Dialogue||But the satisfaction I feel from guiding Sun Haven forward outweighs all else. It's a sacrifice I would make again and again.
Dialogue||In part, it's due to my training. I had to practice clearing my mind to control my magic. That same trick keeps me from losing my composure.
Dialogue||We're lucky to have you, Lucia.
Dialogue||Don't you think you're neglecting yourself?
Dialogue||I would do anything for my people. That means you, XX.
Dialogue||I really don't see it that way at all. Perhaps we simply see things differently, XX.
Dialogue||Have your feelings ever gotten away from you?
Dialogue||I never considered that side of your training before.
Dialogue||Oh, yes... once as a teenager, I got into a shouting match with Catherine about who-knows-what.
Dialogue||We were both hard headed and adept with magic, a bad combination for teenagers... I ended up burning her hair off by accident.
Dialogue||But that's in the past! We haven't fought even once since then. We were only foolish kids at the time.
Dialogue||Naturally, it's not the first thing that comes to mind when you hear "fire magic," but that was actually where Grandfather's training started - with simple meditation.
Dialogue||I'm never too busy for you, XX. How are you doing today?
Dialogue||I ate too many spring rolls last night and had some strange dreams... Has that ever happened to you?
Dialogue||XX! You're looking healthy. Er, I mean you look good. Healthy-good.
Dialogue||Liam, what do you have in your hands there?
Dialogue||So, what would you say if I asked you on a date?
Dialogue||Oh, these! Yeah let me explain, see... well, they're a gift. Um, for you.
Dialogue||I know used oven mitts aren't the best gift ever, but I've used these mitts for years.
Dialogue||They've been with me through all the chaos of moving here, taking care of my sisters, and running the bakery.
Dialogue||Oh wow, I don't know, I mean... I guess it depends.
Dialogue||Er, sorry. You caught me off guard. Go ahead and ask again.
Dialogue||Sounds like they mean a lot to you.
Dialogue||So, why are they for me again?
Dialogue||They've been with me a long time. I want you to have them because I'm grateful for our friendship and... I want you to be with me a long time too, I guess... does that make any sense?
Dialogue||Anyway... I'll stop talking now.
Dialogue||Gladly! Do you want to go out with me?
Dialogue||Actually, this might not be a good idea.
Dialogue||Oh! Well... Yes. I mean, definitely! Sorry, I'm not used to this kind of thing. So um, maybe... meet me in front of the bakery tomorrow at 5:00 pm? Yeah, that should work.
Dialogue||That's how you feel? Don't take this the wrong way, but that's a bit of a relief.
Dialogue||Not that dating you would be a bad thing! I just have a lot going on right now.
Dialogue||I never was attracted to anyone in my village. You're something special, XX.
Dialogue||Hey, XX! Is it just me, or does the whole town feel more lively these days?
Dialogue||It's not just you, I feel it too.
Dialogue||Maybe it's because you've kept everyone so healthy!
Dialogue||I don't want to get my hopes up, but it really feels like Sun Haven has survived the worst of it.
Dialogue||Haha, that's nice XX but I don't think so. I think we've been getting more travelers through town. I've seen some unfamiliar faces here and there.
Dialogue||This town really is unlike any other.
Dialogue||I wouldn't say Sun Haven's recovered just yet.
Dialogue||You're right. Even down south I couldn't find a community as close as this one. I really believe that's the reason Sun Haven has survived - commonwealth.
Dialogue||Well sure, there's still some way to go. But you can't say we're not better off now than we were a few weeks ago.
Dialogue||It's about being optimistic, XX. You might give it a try.
Dialogue||Do you like when new people come through?
Dialogue||Have you had any trouble with travelers before?
Dialogue||Sure! It's always good to keep things new and interesting. Plus, many travelers like to get a check-up after a long journey.
Dialogue||Not personally, although I did watch Mari kick a couple of young guys out of the tavern.
Dialogue||You should have seen it - she dragged them out by the ears! Ronald didn't even notice until she had already slammed the door shut.
Dialogue||There's Sun Haven's favorite farmer!
Dialogue||Actually, I'm Sun Haven's only farmer.
Dialogue||If I'm Sun Haven's favorite farmer, then you're it's favorite courier!
Dialogue||Exactly! So you must also be the favorite, right?
Dialogue||Running mail all the way out to your farm is great for my morning routine, at any rate.
Dialogue||You're darn right I am! You show me someone who delivers mail faster than I can, and I'll eat one of Giuseppe's sculptures.
Dialogue||I'm glad to be of help!
Dialogue||So I'm only the favorite farmer by default, huh?
Dialogue||I'm glad, too! My routine was getting a little too easy.
Dialogue||Oh, don't sound so insulted. At least people like you!
Dialogue||You'd actually eat a sculpture??
Dialogue||You're so fit, it's hard to picture someone faster than you.
Dialogue||Well not really, XX. I wouldn't even know how to start... Maybe with a fork and hammer?
Dialogue||Honestly, it would be nice to have someone to race. I love some healthy competition!
Dialogue||Hello hello, happy day XX! It's going to be a happy day because my animals told me so.
Dialogue||You can... talk to animals?
Dialogue||What are you going to do on this happy day?
Dialogue||Huh? No, silly! Don't joke XX, I can just tell by their moods, nya.
Dialogue||Today the chickens were bobbing their heads a lot and talking to each other. If the chickens are happy, then it's a happy day!
Dialogue||I was thinking of stretching in the sunshine... but then I remembered how Roza told me not to lay down on the paths, nyaaaan.
Dialogue||It's incredible how well you know those animals.
Dialogue||I don't know why you think that means they're happy.
Dialogue||It only takes time to get to know them, nya. You can do the same thing too, easy easy. Just spend time with animals on your farm and you'll see!
Dialogue||You don't understand the animals like I do, XX. I'm friends with all my animals, nya nya!
Dialogue||Why not lay on the grass?
Dialogue||Why not go for a run?
Dialogue||The grass doesn't get as warm as the paths do. I also like to rub my cheeks in the hard ground, teehee!
Dialogue||Or better yet - a chase! But who should I chase... Squirrel? Bird? Pod? Choices, choices, nya...
Dialogue||Sorry XX, I spilled stinkwort on my dress earlier. I know, it smells horrible.
Dialogue||Hi hi!! Are we having a super duper day, nya?
Dialogue||Don't forget, you're going to owe me anniversary presents for the rest of our lives!
Dialogue||Don't you mean "Anne"-iversaries?
Dialogue||I'm lucky you have such a wide range of tastes, then!
Dialogue||Very cute, XX. No, really, that's actually a very cute joke!
Dialogue||But for the record, I don't accept jokes for gifts.
Dialogue||Don't be so quick, XX. I appreciate a variety of items, but they're all linked by one virtue - worth.
Dialogue||Yes, dear...
Dialogue||You'll change your mind when you hear my <i>good</i> jokes.
Dialogue||Oh, don't pout like a child - that makes me feel bad! It's not like I'm sending you to your room, for goodness sake.
Dialogue||I somehow doubt that, XX... But feel free to try!
Dialogue||So, expensive tastes then. Got it!
Dialogue||What about homemade gifts?
Dialogue||To put it bluntly... but that's part of why I love you, isn't it?
Dialogue||Only if you're an expert jeweler, XX. Are you an expert jeweler? I didn't think so.
Dialogue||Do you bug everyone that walks by or am I special?
Dialogue||I watch Liam bake at home at night time. He calls it "prepping" but I don't know what that is.
Dialogue||Come take a look at my merchandise. You might spy something you like!
Dialogue||Breathing in fresh air, working on my craft, and spending time with the family... This is what life is all about.
Dialogue||I work closely with the Archmage. Think of me as her sword.
Dialogue||My dear XX, I hope you're enjoying your day. I see you're already building a sweat!
Dialogue||... Am I really sweaty?
Dialogue||I hope your day is going well, too!
Dialogue||Oh! Sorry XX, I didn't mean to make you self-conscious.
Dialogue||Anyway, I like it! It lets me know that you've been busy.
Dialogue||Well, so far I stopped Emma and Elizabeth from fighting over a book they both wanted, then I picked up some trash around town, and now I'm talking to you!
Dialogue||You could say it's a pretty standard day for me.
Dialogue||I guess I don't mind it then!
Dialogue||I don't want to look like a mess in front of you, Jun.
Dialogue||Ah, good! It's important to get comfortable with this kind of thing. We're spending our lives together, and that means sharing <i>everything</i>.
Dialogue||XX, you need to get comfortable with this kind of thing. We're spending our lives together, you know. That means sharing <i>everything</i>.
Dialogue||Sometimes I forget how much you do in a day.
Dialogue||We need a "Jun Day" to celebrate how much you do for Sun Haven.
Dialogue||Look who's talking! I couldn't keep up with you in a day if I tried!
Dialogue||Hah! Can you imagine, little flags with my face on them?
Dialogue||I don't think my ego is big enough for something like that, though. I would be so uncomfortable!
Dialogue||Acting as Sun Haven's leader takes considerable work. I imagine running a farm is the same way.
Dialogue||I know how you learned about magic, but how did you learn to lead a town?
Dialogue||This town is the product of your hard work.
Dialogue||When I first took the role, I learned by reading books. Diaries, actually, of Sun Haven's previous leaders.
Dialogue||This town has generations of history passed through the hands of notable leaders. Their experiences were invaluable learning tools for me.
Dialogue||Thank you, but each and every citizen contributes to Sun Haven's growth. That's part of what makes Sun Haven beautiful.
Dialogue||That doesn't make you sound very qualified.
Dialogue||That's clever, no wonder you're so good at this!
Dialogue||Regardless of how it sounds, look around you. Sun Haven still stands. There is order here, at my command.
Dialogue||I know I'm fulfilling my role. Furthermore, I trust my people to hold me accountable. I give you that same trust, XX.
Dialogue||Oh, nonsense. I credit my people - which includes you, of course! XX, as our only farmer, you're now a significant part of Sun Haven's community.
Dialogue||I hope I do my part!
Dialogue||True, but we all take after your example.
Dialogue||XX, of course you do. In fact, I suspect you do more than you realize.
Dialogue||XX, we should talk every day because I always seem to come away with lifted spirits. You have a truly kind soul!
Dialogue||AH! - Sorry XX, I saw a birdie.
Dialogue||Sometimes I still can't believe you chose me!
Dialogue||I think you're the best thing to happen to Sun Haven in a long time, XX. You're certainly the best thing that's happened to me.
Dialogue||Hiiiii XX. Are you happy you moved to Sun Haven yet, nya?
Dialogue||Have you always lived in Sun Haven?
Dialogue||What's your favorite place in Sun Haven?
Dialogue||Almost my whole whole life, I have. It's my favorite place for sure!
Dialogue||I like all the birdies that stop by the bird bath outside of Catherine's house. But she asks me to leave them alone, nyan. I just can't help but swat at them, teehee.
Dialogue||Could you see yourself living anywhere else?
Dialogue||It seems like a lot of travelers end up staying in Sun Haven.
Dialogue||Maaaaybe the Great City, nya. But I've never seen the Great City before. It would be a Kitty adventure!
Dialogue||Sure sure, they know I'm here! Teehee, just kidding.
Dialogue||You shouldn't attack the poor birds.
Dialogue||I bet you could catch them easily!
Dialogue||I can't help it, they're so flappy! Besides, I'm not <i>really</i> attacking, just playing.
Dialogue||Oh yes, nya! But don't worry, I don't hurt the little cuties!
Dialogue||You've had your powers for some time now, XX. How are you adjusting?
Dialogue||I think I'm pretty comfortable with my powers.
Dialogue||How long did it take you to adjust to your powers, Lucia?
Dialogue||Well, as one Blessed to another, I'm glad to hear that! You're going to develop into an incredibly powerful individual some day, XX. It's good to have you on our side!
Dialogue||Well you should remember that I was training my powers as a little girl. But maybe that's not quite what you meant.
Dialogue||I'd say it took a year or two to finally adjust to actually having powers. To feel like they weren't just something to keep under control, and instead were truly part of me.
Dialogue||It's good to be on your side, too!
Dialogue||Well what if I... decided to switch sides?
Dialogue||With our powers put together, we'll secure the future of Sun Haven!
Dialogue||If that's your idea of a joke, I really don't appreciate it. You shouldn't joke about using your powers like that, XX.
Dialogue||You seem like such a natural, I'd have never guessed.
Dialogue||That long, huh?
Dialogue||Every skilled master started as an untested novice. That goes for anything!
Dialogue||What you see when you look at me is an accomplished Archmage. What you don't see are the years of self-doubt and struggling.
Dialogue||If you ever want to race, just let me know, nya!
Dialogue||Emma got into a sack of flour this morning. The handprints she left all over the floor were real cute, but it was a mess!
Dialogue||Must have been a pain to clean the mess all on your own.
Dialogue||So does this mean everything you bake is going to have Emma germs in it?!
Dialogue||It might have been, but it wasn't really a big one. Besides, Emma helped clean it up! I can't get upset at her or anything, she's just a kid after all.
Dialogue||I don't know if I would have it in me to ever be angry with either of my sisters, honestly.
Dialogue||Don't worry, XX, it was just one sack. I threw it all out after we cleaned up.
Dialogue||I love Emma to death, but that doesn't mean everyone wants her dirty little fingers all over the flour that made their bread. Even if her little fingers are so cute!
Dialogue||It's hard to be angry at cute little Emma.
Dialogue||She shouldn't be causing that kind of trouble.
Dialogue||Heh, yeah. We had a talk about staying out of the flour, and I think she'll behave now. She's a good kid, and I love her.
Dialogue||That's... true. Maybe I should be a little more strict with the girls, but it's so hard to get angry at them.
Dialogue||I'm just kidding, I know you wouldn't use that flour.
Dialogue||Whew, that's a relief.
Dialogue||Ah, oh, right! Heh, sometimes I don't catch on to jokes like that. I gotta lighten up, right?
Dialogue||Don't worry, we practice good hygiene at this bakery. Our flour will always be Emma free!
Dialogue||Topi is my friend. Maybe even my best friend! No wait, that's mama.
Dialogue||Hey there, uh, looking good there... champ.
Dialogue||I'm sorry, flirting isn't my strong suit.
Dialogue||I'm telling you, XX - live in a cart. It's so much more affordable than a house!
Dialogue||Kitty had a nightmare last night... I was climbing a tree all grown up, but I got stuck like I did as a kitten!
Dialogue||I'm sure you're strong enough to get back down, now!
Dialogue||Maybe Catherine can help you with those nightmares.
Dialogue||What if it's a warning that I shouldn't be climbing trees anymore? Oh that would make Kitty sad!
Dialogue||Like with magical herbs, nya? I don't like Catherine's potions too much. They taste so... yuck! Nasty.
Dialogue||Don't be sad, I'm sure you won't get stuck.
Dialogue||You'll be ok, but maybe you can climb shorter trees for now, just in case!
Dialogue||You're right, I'm a pretty good climber now, nya! So nice to have a sunny friend cheering me on. Thanks, XX!
Dialogue||You're right, nya! Gosh you're so clever, XX!
Dialogue||You should just deal with it if you want to avoid the nightmares.
Dialogue||It's true... Maybe she could make one that tastes like berries?
Dialogue||Ugh, I'd rather have nightmares, nyan...
Dialogue||Oh! Or fish! I think I'll go ask her to try, nya. Good idea, XX!
Dialogue||I just came across an old critic's review of my first concerto. He called it "lacking in concrete inspiration."
Dialogue||Heh, critics...
Dialogue||Do you agree with what the critic said?
Dialogue||How did you come across such an old review?
Dialogue||Not really. Maybe he was right, or maybe he was wrong. Either way, I don't really write my music for other people's enjoyment.
Dialogue||My concerto is famous through every region of the land. Hundreds of people wrote what they thought about it.
Dialogue||Sometimes, when I'm really dwelling on the past, I'll go back see what people said about my concerto.
Dialogue||Who do you write your music for, then?
Dialogue||You don't care if people like your music?
Dialogue||I write my music for me, XX. I appreciate if other people enjoy it, but it's not necessary.
Dialogue||I feel if I tried to make music specifically that other people would like, I'd just limit myself.
Dialogue||That's truly amazing, Claude!
Dialogue||That's an unhealthy obsession.
Dialogue||Yeah. Like I said, it was famous through every region. Some of them write that they love, it others write they they hate it.
Dialogue||I don't mind much either way, but it's interesting they care enough about my music to hate it.
Dialogue||If there's one thing I'll never do, it's allow myself to be confined by the opinion of another. I can read all the old reviews I want.
Dialogue||Hey there, XX. I could go for a good mango right about now.
Dialogue||Mango?
Dialogue||How's Charlie doing?
Dialogue||Oh, maybe you don't know. It's a type of fruit that grows all over the Southern Islands. I used to be able to eat them every day, if I wanted.
Dialogue||Oh, so you remembered my little pet mouse, huh? Heh, no one usually bothers to ask me about Charlie. He's doing just fine, actually. As far as mice go, at least.
Dialogue||Most people consider mice to be a pest, but that's such a limited way of thinking! Charlie doesn't think of himself as a pest, you know.
Dialogue||What's the best replacement for a mango that Sun Haven's got?
Dialogue||Could I grow a mango?
Dialogue||Hrm, the best replacement for a mango? I guess apples come the closest, but they're not quite the same.
Dialogue||I'm not so sure of that. They only grow on trees in very warm climates. I've never seen a mango tree this far north, at least.
Dialogue||It's just a mouse, you could've gotten rid of it.
Dialogue||You're such a softie.
Dialogue||Nope. Not my style, XX. It was Charlie's house first, that's how it is. I don't need to explain myself more than that. Though I wonder, would Charlie like mango?
Dialogue||What can I say? Just because Charlie is a mouse doesn't mean he's less important than I am! Though I wonder, would Charlie like mango?
Dialogue||I'm the first of all my siblings to get married. They're all so jealous! Hehe.
Dialogue||Hello again, XX.
Dialogue||Wait, did you actually call me by my name?
Dialogue||I want to contribute to Withergate's prosperity, my prince.
Dialogue||Don't push it. You're walking a razor-thin line right now. Make wise decisions.
Dialogue||Are you suggesting that Withergate needs the help of an outsider?
Dialogue||Does this mean I can call you Darius?
Dialogue||I'm honored, Prince Darius.
Dialogue||That's pushing it. You're still an outsider.
Dialogue||I'm glad that my investment in you hasn't been a complete waste of time.
Dialogue||Not at all, my prince. I only want to help if I can.
Dialogue||Everyone needs help, sometimes.
Dialogue||If you wish to join the higher levels of our society, you must learn not to degrade yourself like this.
Dialogue||Your Human town might call for aid when things get rough, but Withergate succeeds on its own. You have nothing to offer us.
Dialogue||I've been taking more walks like you said and it really helps. I'm more relaxed at home, which is a lot better for the girls.
Dialogue||How are your sisters doing?
Dialogue||Say, where is the rest of your family?
Dialogue||They're just fine, thanks! Both of them are responsible for their age, so I can leave them alone sometimes.
Dialogue||If they needed a close eye on them like Pod does, then I don't know how I could do my job.
Dialogue||Ooh, sorry XX that's... a touchy subject. Um. Maybe I'll tell you sometime, but I don't want to get into it right now.
Dialogue||Are you sure you're giving them enough attention?
Dialogue||You've got some wonderful sisters, there.
Dialogue||Hm, I guess they might be a little overlooked sometimes. You don't think I'm being neglectful? Ah, maybe I should talk to them.
Dialogue||I know. Sometimes I forget that they're so young because they manage themselves so well. I could learn something from them, for sure.
Dialogue||You can share with me.
Dialogue||I can wait until you're ready to talk about it.
Dialogue||Sorry, XX. Maybe someday.
Dialogue||You're a good friend, XX. I'm glad you're here.
Dialogue||You've made me happy in a whole new way, XX.
Dialogue||Everytime I see you, you look a little bit stronger! You must be really working your farm over there.
Dialogue||Do you really think I'm looking stronger?
Dialogue||The farm keeps me plenty busy.
Dialogue||I'm not joking, if that's what you think. I take fitness seriously, and it seems you do too.
Dialogue||Oh, maybe we could start a class together! It's time the neighborhood got into shape.
Dialogue||I can see that! Sometimes I think Giuseppe would benefit from more work, too. But then I see how good he is with the kids and, well, it would be a shame to sacrifice that.
Dialogue||That sounds fun!
Dialogue||I'm too busy for something like that.
Dialogue||Really? Nobody in town is ever so excited about exercise - other than me, of course.
Dialogue||And here I thought you could be the fellow health nut I've been waiting for in Sun Haven. Oh well, maybe I can get Giuseppe to do some sit ups... yeah right!
Dialogue||You're lucky to have each other.
Dialogue||Isn't it worth it if Giuseppe is healthier?
Dialogue||Don't I know it! Even if we get into a squabble, he has me laughing by the end of it.
Dialogue||Hm, I don't think so. It's easy to be healthy, but it's difficult to be a good parent.
Dialogue||I'm only telling you this because I trust you... I think Nathaniel's hair is covering a bald spot. Shh, don't say anything!
Dialogue||How's my favorite farmer doing today?
Dialogue||Visiting with a dear friend is as important as any city council work.
Dialogue||I hope you're planning to stay. We don't need vacationers, we need citizens.
Dialogue||XX, I'm glad you're here. My mind could use a distraction.
Dialogue||Why not head to the carnival if you need a distraction?
Dialogue||Darius, as the prince of Withergate... are you dating anyone?
Dialogue||Because I have no capacity for childish games... but, at least the citizens enjoy it.
Dialogue||Xyla suggested it would raise spirits here. Monsterfolk are a downtrodden people, so my father made the call.
Dialogue||In actuality, I would prefer to have barracks and barracks of fighters to protect our city. Maybe we will, one day.
Dialogue||Oh? Heh, that caught me off guard. I never know what to expect from you, XX.
Dialogue||In fact, I have no romantic involvement right now. I'm very much open to the idea, though.
Dialogue||Increasing your strength is always a good idea.
Dialogue||Security is important, but so is having fun.
Dialogue||Certainly. It would secure the future of my family, as well as all monsterfolk. Your support is more than welcome.
Dialogue||Of course you think so. You're still an outsider, completely ignorant of my people's history.
Dialogue||I'm surprised you don't already have someone at your side.
Dialogue||I'm sure you will find someone soon!
Dialogue||My father has tried to arrange my relationships before, but that never ended well. I much prefer to make those decisions on my own.
Dialogue||Oh? Do you know something I don't? I'm keeping my eye on you, XX.
Dialogue||I'm bored in school. I never know what Mister Jun is saying.
Dialogue||I was in school once, too.
Dialogue||You should tell that to Mr. Jun.
Dialogue||You were? Did you like it?
Dialogue||No way, that's a trick!
Dialogue||I loved it!
Dialogue||I didn't like it either.
Dialogue||Nuh-uh, I don't believe you. School is boring. You're not boring, though.
Dialogue||School is boring. You're not boring, though. I wish I could go to the farm instead of school.
Dialogue||Mr. Jun wouldn't trick you.
Dialogue||You won't get help unless you ask, Pod.
Dialogue||That's true. Mister Jun is a good friend!
Dialogue||No! You can't tell me what to do!
Dialogue||I don't know why, but my thoughts are pretty scattered today. Maybe I'm working too much.
Dialogue||Here's a question to get your mind off things - what's your favorite holiday?
Dialogue||Do you ever take a day off for yourself?
Dialogue||Oh man, so many holidays... I really like the Lantern Festival. Everyone gets together to celebrate the union between people and dragons.
Dialogue||A whole day off for myself, what a concept. I don't think I've had a day like that since... well, since I moved here with my sisters.
Dialogue||What do you like about it?
Dialogue||Sounds fun! What do you do to celebrate?
Dialogue||We get together as group to send floating lanterns into the sky. I think there's something symbolic about it, but I don't really remember... It's a nice time, though.
Dialogue||I like it because we're all celebrating the same thing. I don't feel out of place because I'm just another local.
Dialogue||Man, I'm rambling and I don't even know if I'm making sense.
Dialogue||It sounds like you don't know how to take care of yourself.
Dialogue||Your sisters are lucky to have a hard-working brother taking care of them.
Dialogue||Ugh, I know. I just don't know how I can make time for myself with everything else on my plate. Maybe I'm doing something wrong.
Dialogue||Thanks for saying so. People don't understand what it's like raising them on my own AND working at the same time.
Dialogue||So is it love at first sight? I mean, with Sun Haven?
Dialogue||You've been here a while, right Jun? Do you still like it here?
Dialogue||Did you move here like me?
Dialogue||Of course, Sun Haven is great. I just wish it was doing better. The people here have a strong will, though, so I'm optimistic.
Dialogue||The trick is not losing hope, and if anyone does lose hope then that's where I come in.
Dialogue||Not at all, I was born and raised here in Sun Haven. I've never even visited the Great City. My little house has been my only home all my life.
Dialogue||I think Sun Haven will bounce back!
Dialogue||How do you stay so positive?
Dialogue||That's exactly the positivity I'm talking about! I already knew you were a positive person, but it's nice hearing you talk like that.
Dialogue||I take care of myself. For me that means taking an inventory of my worries or fears and writing them down. Maybe it's not for everybody, but that's my process.
Dialogue||There's no reason to move if you're happy.
Dialogue||Living in one house your whole life sounds terribly boring.
Dialogue||Oh, absolutely. Hey, feel free to come visit me whenever you want! You know, so you can see my home. My house is just above Liam's. He's a great neighbor, too.
Dialogue||It's good to know you think I'm boring!
Dialogue||You know, I really wish you could meet my family. My father would love you.
Dialogue||Maybe I will, one day.
Dialogue||You look a little far away. What's up?
Dialogue||Oh wow, I was just speaking my thoughts. But the idea of visiting home with you sounds so fun!
Dialogue||I could show you the gorge, and my all my friends, and if we timed it right we could even catch the smithing festival!
Dialogue||Some days, like today, I get a little homesick. When I feel like this, I like to make myself a meal that I would have had back in my village.
Dialogue||Whoa - slow down!
Dialogue||I would love to see where you came from.
Dialogue||Oh? I didn't realize I was getting so carried away. Sorry if that made you uncomfortable.
Dialogue||Let's try to make it happen one day. And then I can visit the Great City with you. I've never seen a city like that before.
Dialogue||I love making plans with you like this! Just think of all the fun we'll have together.
Dialogue||Does that help?
Dialogue||What kind of food do you make?
Dialogue||Oh yes, it definitely does. I also write letters to my family.
Dialogue||That reminds me, I still have a few letters to send off. Thank goodness Sun Haven has a post office.
Dialogue||I can make all of the best eastern dishes from my village! My favorite is pickled veggie salad, but sometimes I will go all out with a creamy beef stew.
Dialogue||I have lots of free time today, nya! Stop and talk with Kitty, yeah?
Dialogue||What would you do on your perfect day off?
Dialogue||Who do you like to hang out with in your free time?
Dialogue||<i>Purrfect,</i> you say? I would spend the day like I used to when I was a kitten, nya nya - running around with my friends, climbing trees and chasing squirrels!
Dialogue||Lynn is really the best, nya! She lets me keep talking forever and ever. I don't know anyone else that does that for Kitty.
Dialogue||That sounds kind of tiring.
Dialogue||... What do you do with squirrels when you catch them?
Dialogue||It's hard for me to get tired - I have lots and lots of energy! Can't you tell?
Dialogue||Teehee, oh, XX. I let them go, silly! Sometimes I'll sneak a little kiss on their cute little heads, but that's all!
Dialogue||Lynn is nice like that - I'm glad you're friends!
Dialogue||I think Lynn is just too nice to interrupt...
Dialogue||Yeah! She doesn't even interrupt me when I go on forever about things. She's a good good listener, nya!
Dialogue||Well... Still, she never does interrupt, at least. Either way, I like her.
Dialogue||First I was blessed, then I became Archmage, and now I'm married... More and more, it seems like my fate is simply tied to Sun Haven.
Dialogue||It's a good thing you like it here!
Dialogue||Do you really believe in fate?
Dialogue||XX, that is being deceptively modest. I wouldn't say I simply like it here - Sun Haven will forever be my home. I am in love with this place!
Dialogue||I certainly do, XX. It's important for a leader to believe in a grand purpose. Otherwise, why should she bother leading in the first place?
Dialogue||It has been good to you, huh?
Dialogue||You have a lot of memories here.
Dialogue||To be completely candid, I meant it when I said my fate is tied to this town. I truly believe that, were I to leave Sun Haven, then I would be leaving behind all the goodness in my life.
Dialogue||Leadership gets you power.
Dialogue||That's a thoughtful point, Lucia.
Dialogue||Any person who craves power merely for the sake of being powerful is weak in the mind.
Dialogue||Thank you, dear XX. Without purpose, we would all be like sparks in the air - aimless, and quick to burn out.
Dialogue||I was running through the forest when I found a bag of money!
Dialogue||Hello again, nya!
Dialogue||What's up??
Dialogue||Did you say "nya?"
Dialogue||What do you do here, Kitty?
Dialogue||Nya, that's right! Haven't you met a cat like me before? Don't tell me I'm your first, nya? Oh my goodness, then what do you think of my ears??
Dialogue||I run the pet store! Are you surprised, nya??
Dialogue||They look very colorful.
Dialogue||They look fluffy and cute.
Dialogue||Nya?! You really mean it?! Just don't stare too long, okie?
Dialogue||You run the store all by yourself?
Dialogue||That makes a lot of sense!
Dialogue||Not alone, nya! I have help from Nim. And not only that, but I take care of all the animals in Sun Haven town! I even sell animals you could use on your farm.
Dialogue||Not only that, I take care of all the animals in Sun Haven town! I even sell animals you could use on your farm.
Dialogue||XX, I... forgot what I was going to ask. Never mind, ignore me!
Dialogue||I hope it rains soon.
Dialogue||I'll never forget the day you stepped off of that train.
Dialogue||Withergate grows ever darker with you in its presence.
Dialogue||Seeing your face every day makes me think I must be the luckiest man alive.
Dialogue||If you were the luckiest man alive, you would also be rich.
Dialogue||You think you're lucky? You're dating a farmer - I'm dating a doctor!
Dialogue||I am rich - in love and affection! Heheh.
Dialogue||XX, you're every bit as important as I am in this town. We need a farmer exactly as much as we need a doctor!
Dialogue||Well, except for Albert. That guy needs a doctor <i>way</i> more than he needs a farmer...
Dialogue||Boooooo.
Dialogue||Nice one!
Dialogue||I get it, my jokes are too good. No need to explain, it's obvious. You love my humor too much.
Dialogue||Just when I thought you couldn't be more perfect - you like bad jokes!
Dialogue||Are you making fun of a patient? Isn't that wrong?
Dialogue||Then this town is lucky to have us both.
Dialogue||Sorry XX, but I need to keep my sense of humor. It's my defense mechanism as a doctor.
Dialogue||Sun Haven really has changed my life in every way possible. I know it did the same for you too, XX. You're right, we're both lucky for lots of reasons.
Dialogue||I can't wait for the day we get a cannon. We were promised one a long time ago, but it never showed up.
Dialogue||Hm, you must be the new farmer. I'm Claude.
Dialogue||I'm XX. Good to meet you!
Dialogue||Sure thing. Er, you too.
Dialogue||How goes it, XX. Have anything to report?
Dialogue||Drop and give me twenty!
Dialogue||Fine looking sword you have. Are you any good with it?
Dialogue||Argh!
Dialogue||Jeez, XX. You just took me right back to my days as a trainee grunt... I almost fell to the ground out of instinct! Whew, at least was only you pulling me leg.
Dialogue||First of all, thanks for noticing the sword! It's actually my mother's old army sword. The military decommissions weapons after so long, but she took great care of this one.
Dialogue||To answer your question, I'm pretty good with every type of melee weapon. Not a big fan of the crossbow, though. Never cared for fighting at a distance.
Dialogue||I was only having a bit of fun.
Dialogue||I don't think I've ever seen you flustered like that.
Dialogue||I know, I know. But my heart jump right into my throat for a second! Thanks for waking me up, at least, heh.
Dialogue||Yeah yeah, 'big, stoic Nathaniel', scared of some old drill instructor memories. But my heart jump right into my throat for a second! Thanks for waking me up, at least, heh.
Dialogue||Shouldn't a captain of the guard be handy with any weapon?
Dialogue||Hey, focus on what you're good at, right?
Dialogue||Well, thanks for the concern, XX. I can handle crossbows just fine, they're just not my preferred weapon. I hope my preference is alright with you.
Dialogue||In reality I'm passable with a crossbow, thanks to plenty of 'enriching' training. I'm just more up-close-and-personal with my fighting, I guess.
Dialogue||I wrote a bit of music the other day, my muse. I'm not sure if it's very good, but strangely I'm not concerned with its quality. It was simply fun to compose.
Dialogue||Composing music for <i>fun</i>?!
Dialogue||I'm happy you're starting to enjoy life more.
Dialogue||Heheh, is it really that crazy a thought for me? I just feel so elated these days, it's as if I'm finding new joy in everything, including my music.
Dialogue||You wouldn't happen to know why that is, would you, my muse?
Dialogue||I owe that to you, my muse. Without you in my life, all I'd see is the same mundane future ahead of me. I owe everything to you.
Dialogue||Nope. I couldn't tell you!
Dialogue||Hm. Did you start sleeping on a new pillow?
Dialogue||XX, I don't think I can ever put into words how happy I am with you. Perhaps I will have to express it through a new concerto.
Dialogue||I'm always going to be here for you, Claude.
Dialogue||You shouldn't exaggerate like that.
Dialogue||I'm... so happy to hear that, XX. I love you.
Dialogue||I didn't exaggerate anything, XX. You truly mean that much to me. Why don't you believe me?
Dialogue||Hey XX, I think I overheard someone talking about us in the tavern last night.
Dialogue||I hate when people talk behind my back...
Dialogue||Does it make you that uncomfortable?
Dialogue||You should do your best to ignore it.
Dialogue||Kind of, but it's not important. I guess I never thought I would be worth gossiping about again.
Dialogue||But if you're asking whether I like the attention or not? Not really, that doesn't do anything for me.
Dialogue||I know, and I do try my best. Some things just get under my skin. I've got a sore history with gossip, is all.
Dialogue||No way, I think you love the attention!
Dialogue||I figured - you don't exactly love the spotlight.
Dialogue||Well, you're just plain wrong about me then.
Dialogue||Heh, I guess you've gotten to know me pretty well. I'm glad, XX.
Dialogue||You and I can gossip about everyone in town to get back at them.
Dialogue||Who was it?
Dialogue||Heh, I don't think that will be necessary. Thank you for the laugh though, XX.
Dialogue||Oh, Calvin and some guards. I guess I shouldn't be surprised - Calvin is always talking about other people.
Dialogue||Today feels like a lazy day to me. How about you, XX?
Dialogue||If you're feeling lazy, I could cook for you. What's your favorite meal?
Dialogue||How do you pass the time on lazy days?
Dialogue||I can put a good dent in an everything-stuffed casserole, especially if it has extra carrots. And for dessert - apple cinnamon pie!
Dialogue||I love books of poetry. They remind me of spells.
Dialogue||I don't like pie.
Dialogue||Since you make potions, you must be a fantastic cook!
Dialogue||What! That can't be... XX, you have to try one from Liam's shop. They're to die for, I don't know how he does it. If I didn't know better, I'd think he was a witch, too.
Dialogue||Thanks for the vote of confidence, but... Unfortunately, I'm a terrible cook. Potions and salves are a piece of cake, but an actual piece of cake? I might as well not try.
Dialogue||You have to try one from Liam's shop. They're to die for, I don't know how he does it. If I didn't know better, I'd think he was a witch, too.
Dialogue||Why do they remind you of spells?
Dialogue||Do you have a favorite poem?
Dialogue||There's power in words, you know. It's kind of the basis of witchcraft. If someone wrote a strong poem with a specific intent? That's essentially a spell.
Dialogue||I don't have one favorite, but there's a book of love poems in the library. It's kind of my guilty pleasure... I always find myself blushing by the end of it!
Dialogue||Learn your place, outsider.
Dialogue||The future may not be clear, but I think it's starting to look brighter everyday.
Dialogue||Sorry, I can't talk for long. I'm going over city planning today at the town hall. It is... unexciting.
Dialogue||Cynthia thinks she has Sun Haven's romance market in the palm of her hand. I love the girl, but she's going to see how a real merchant plays the game.
Dialogue||I hope Mister Jun has cookies tomorrow...
Dialogue||Oh, hello! Aren't you my train buddy? It's good to see a face that I actually recognize.
Dialogue||What do you do here, Lynn?
Dialogue||Where did you say you're from?
Dialogue||I'm a blacksmith. Or I guess, apprentice blacksmith. Solon is teaching me but I've only just started training with him. I hope to be as good as him, one day.
Dialogue||I'm from a little village in the east, so I'm still learning to live in a big city like this. It's a lot to take in.
Dialogue||Blacksmithing? That wouldn't have been my first guess.
Dialogue||I'm sure you'll become a master one day, too.
Dialogue||Everyone seems surprised when they hear that, but I don't see why. Many women in my old village work the forge. Is it really so odd?
Dialogue||Oh, well, thank you! I - I'm sorry, compliments always catch me by surprise. You're very nice, you know!
Dialogue||If you think this is a big city, you're really clueless!
Dialogue||I'm adjusting, too. You'll get used to it in no time.
Dialogue||Oh. I'm really sorry, I didn't know...
Dialogue||Thanks. For now I'm taking it slow and trying to explore a new part of Sun Haven every day.
Dialogue||Hey, that cloud looks just like a croissant.
Dialogue||Don't be afraid to drop by for a visit sometime. My house is big enough for the two of us.
Dialogue||Did you see something strange over there? Maybe I should check it out to be safe.
Dialogue||Fancy meeting you out and about, XX. Or were you trying to find me? Hehe.
Dialogue||Hello, XX. I'm pleased to see you integrating well in my city. Citizens like you will ensure Withergate's prolific future.
Dialogue||I'm curious to know your plans for Withergate's future.
Dialogue||You know, your people seem to regard you very highly.
Dialogue||My father has laid the groundwork for a successful city, but this is just the start. Withergate will expand into its own worldly region under the rule of King Darius.
Dialogue||Of course they do, my father and I have given them a quality of life unknown to monsters before Withergate. We forged the first monster community in the world, and it prospers.
Dialogue||Your father is an imposing ruler, but I look forward to seeing you take the throne.
Dialogue||That's good, Withergate could use some quality leadership.
Dialogue||As do I, outsider. With my family's legacy behind me, there is only fortune in my future. Maybe you will be there to see it, too.
Dialogue||You dare speak of my father like that? Do you crave punishment? Your opinion is lowly and worthless, just like you. If your words mattered one bit, I would have you locked away for such disrespect.
Dialogue||Withergate is the first monster community ever?
Dialogue||Where did monsters live before Withergate?
Dialogue||I hope you're just ignorant and not truly questioning me, for your sake. There's never been a city like this before now. Monsterfolk used to live only as exiles.
Dialogue||Now, with a place for them to live freely, they are thriving more than ever.
Dialogue||Having another busy day, XX? That would make two of us!
Dialogue||XX, have you lost weight? I thought we were supposed to <i>gain</i> weight after we got married.
Dialogue||Is that good medical advice?
Dialogue||Are you worried about putting on a few pounds?
Dialogue||It's not really medical advice, but it's something I've noticed with married couples. Many of them gain a little weight after being married - I see it as a sign of happiness!
Dialogue||Ah! You noticed??
Dialogue||I don't get as much exercise as you, XX, that's for sure. Maybe I should join Tonya on her morning runs...
Dialogue||I'm plenty happy, Wornhardt, even if I don't gain any weight.
Dialogue||We're not like other married couples.
Dialogue||Heh, well that's good to hear! Hm, maybe I should weigh myself at the hospital...
Dialogue||Heheh, is that what you think?
Dialogue||I always thought of us as something special, too. I wonder if everyone feels this way?
Dialogue||That would probably be good for you.
Dialogue||Nonsense - you look good!
Dialogue||You know XX, there are gentler ways to tell somebody to lose weight.
Dialogue||Oh! Hah, well now that you mention it, I am a good weight for my height. But I'll keep an eye on it to be sure I stay healthy, of course!
Dialogue||Did I scratch you? Sorry! My claws are extra sharp right now, teehee!
Dialogue||Maybe we could go to the tavern one of these days!
Dialogue||Another sunny day in Sun Haven - what a surprise.
Dialogue||Seeing you fills me with a sort of spark that I never thought I'd be able to capture.
Dialogue||It seems like a good day for farming. Not that I would really know.
Dialogue||It's good to see you out.
Dialogue||I hope your day ends on a good note, Claude!
Dialogue||Fresh air sometimes clears my head, but it isn't working today. I guess I don't mind seeing a familiar face on my walk, though.
Dialogue||That would be a first. Oh, wait... good "note." I get it. That's actually not a bad joke, XX.
Dialogue||What are you working on these days?
Dialogue||Oh, just a hopeless piano composition to revolutionize music as we know it...
Dialogue||What joke?
Dialogue||I'll take that as a compliment!
Dialogue||Oh, I must have misunderstood. Like usual.
Dialogue||I don't mean to offend, it's just that most people aren't funny to me. Just, annoying. I'm surprised you aren't annoying me, that's all.
Dialogue||I try my best to get away from the thought, but I can't shake that I'm past my peak.
Dialogue||What was your "peak"?
Dialogue||Why are you so worried?
Dialogue||My concerto, obviously. I wrote it when I was so much younger, the debut to my career as a composer.
Dialogue||It was a swan song that came before birth, instead of before death. I feel like I'll never live up to it again.
Dialogue||If I've already hit the high point of my life as a composer, my peak, then I can't help but wonder if there's any point in composing anything else.
Dialogue||I'm possibly only being dramatic, but I worry all the same.
Dialogue||If you keep composing, you'll get there again.
Dialogue||You'll never peak again if you keep being so sour.
Dialogue||You really think so, XX? It's hard to imagine, but your encouragement is very inspiring... Thanks.
Dialogue||Every emotion I feel goes into my music, good or bad. It isn't for you to dictate like that.
Dialogue||Your music is all great, don't overthink it so much.
Dialogue||Would you just relax already?
Dialogue||I'm glad you think so, but this is a personal problem for me. Don't let it worry you, okay?
Dialogue||Oh, I guess I'm really bothering you with my problems. I truly didn't mean to.
Dialogue||Looking for a running partner? Let me know if you're interested!
Dialogue||I was thinking about getting a new jacket. What do you think? Yeah, better safe than sorry.
Dialogue||I wonder what other guardian dragons are like. Talking to a foreign dragon would be a valuable opportunity!
Dialogue||Sometimes my job around here seems more administrative than militaristic.
Dialogue||You can always talk to me - don't forget that I'm also a counselor.
Dialogue||My lovely XX, you're exactly who I need to see right now.
Dialogue||Rough day?
Dialogue||Just tiring. We're anticipating a shipment of supplies, so we have to take a full inventory of the barracks. It's exhausting.
Dialogue||I could use a pick-me-up. You always have something sweet to say!
Dialogue||Don't let a little counting ruin your day.
Dialogue||Don't work yourself too hard today.
Dialogue||I know, and I won't, but sometimes I have to put on a face for the other soldiers. Today is definitely one of those days.
Dialogue||I guess your hair looks nice today.
Dialogue||If I'm sweet, it's just because I've spent so much time with you.
Dialogue||That's not quite the sweetness I was hoping for, but I'll take what I can get I guess.
Dialogue||See that? That's <i>exactly</i> what I needed. XX, thank you for being so... you!
Dialogue||Sun Haven continues to be full of surprises... You, for instance!
Dialogue||XX! Hey, you look strong. I guess sailing isn't the only way to build real muscle, huh?
Dialogue||When did you learn to sail?
Dialogue||Okay, what's the story behind the spear?
Dialogue||I was born on the sea, so I like to say I started learning from day one.
Dialogue||Oh, this? It was a gift from an Elven village I found by accident.
Dialogue||A storm forced me ashore on an uncharted island once. Uncharted islands are risky, so I didn't know what to expect. I sure didn't expect Elves!
Dialogue||I promised not to reveal their location - you know how secretive Elves can be - and they gave me this as a parting gift. It's super sharp because it's made from coral!
Dialogue||You were born on a boat?
Dialogue||But when did you really learn?
Dialogue||Sure was. I don't think my mother ever forgave me for that... I'm not even joking!
Dialogue||I started early, can't be sure. Definitely when I was a kid, though. I might've been five? My little hands could barely hold a rope!
Dialogue||It's good of you not to reveal their location.
Dialogue||So... where was this island?
Dialogue||I guess so, but I don't know why I would even bother doing that. What's there for me to gain? An island of enemies? No thanks!
Dialogue||Nice try, XX. I'm a sailor, and sailors keep their word.
Dialogue||Duty through service!
Dialogue||Hm? Yes, may I help you?
Dialogue||I'm XX, the new farmer in town.
Dialogue||Oh, yes I suppose we haven't met. My name is Bernard. It's a pleasure.
Dialogue||Hey, XX. Don't mind me, I'm having one of those days.
Dialogue||So what's going on with you?
Dialogue||How about you take a nice walk today?
Dialogue||I completely forgot a customer's order today. They came by last night to place the order for this morning, and I guess I didn't write it down or something.
Dialogue||I was making breakfast for the girls when they came in. Then I remembered it all at once and my heart just sank.
Dialogue||That might be the right idea. Walking makes me breathe. I mean, I'm always breathing. Everyone breathes. But walking breathing is different than regular breathing. You know?
Dialogue||You were taking care of your sisters first. That sounds right to me.
Dialogue||You dropped the ball.
Dialogue||I guess you're right. At least Emma and Elizabeth are taken care of. Sometimes I need a reminder about what's important. Thanks, XX.
Dialogue||I know. Sometimes the ball feels too heavy not to drop it.
Dialogue||I totally agree.
Dialogue||If it works for you, then do it.
Dialogue||Really? I thought I was babbling nonsense... Maybe I really will go take that walk.
Dialogue||You're right, XX. I think I'll go take my walk now.
Dialogue||Hey there. How've you been? I've been a little bored lately, myself.
Dialogue||Why have you been feeling bored?
Dialogue||You should pick up another hobby.
Dialogue||I suppose when I'm feeling uninspired, I get bored. I'm stuck with my music, and nothing is worse than a project half-realized. I either get it done, or I forget about it.
Dialogue||What do you mean "another" hobby, XX? Are you saying my music is a hobby? My music is my entire life, it's never been a hobby.
Dialogue||What do you do to find inspiration?
Dialogue||Your music must take a long time to compose.
Dialogue||Sometimes I listen to my records. If I knew how to make it come whenever I wanted, things would be a lot easier. But that's just not how it works.
Dialogue||It depends on how long I manage to stay inspired. If I knew how to make it come whenever I wanted, things would be a lot easier. But that's just not how it works.
Dialogue||Good point. Find a hobby!
Dialogue||I mean, it's really just a hobby.
Dialogue||A hobby, huh? I don't think I've ever tried to do anything other than music. But maybe it'll alleviate some of this infernal boredom. Something to think about, at least. Thanks.
Dialogue||It really isn't, XX. But why am I bothering to explain myself? I'll just go and suffer my boredom somewhere else.
Dialogue||Did you come by the bakery the other day? If you haven't you should come check it out.
Dialogue||How's the bakery doing, anyway?
Dialogue||Liam, what would be your fantasy baking project?
Dialogue||Business has actually been really good. Oh no, what if I just jinxed it? I take it back!
Dialogue||Wow, I haven't ever thought about that before... But, probably a wedding cake. A really really big one.
Dialogue||Well, I'm glad it's doing well. Even if you just jinxed it.
Dialogue||Are you doing anything different?
Dialogue||Just knowing that I can support myself and the girls is a weight off my mind.
Dialogue||That's the thing, I'm not. It's like the town itself is just getting a second wind. I don't get it, but I'm not about to question a good thing.
Dialogue||If I get married, I'm having you make the cake!
Dialogue||Do you really think you could handle something like that?
Dialogue||Really?? That's awesome, I'll start planning it!
Dialogue||Wait, no, nevermind. Too soon. It does sound fun though!
Dialogue||On second thought, I would probably screw it up and ruin the wedding.
Dialogue||You're looking energetic today - you must have slept well, huh?
Dialogue||One of the first things I tell my clients is, good sleep is key to a healthy attitude!
Dialogue||What made you want to be a counselor to begin with?
Dialogue||So what are your tips for sleeping well at night?
Dialogue||I always get emotionally involved in people's stories, even when they have nothing to do with me. In part, I'm just a naturally good listener.
Dialogue||That's also part of why I enjoy teaching so much... Oh, you didn't know that I'm also the teacher for the kids here?
Dialogue||I work hard every day to tire myself out. There's nothing like going to bed feeling adequately exhausted.
Dialogue||But really, it's all about time management. Just keep an eye on your clock when it gets dark to make sure you don't stay up too late by mistake.
Dialogue||Do you really think you're making people happier?
Dialogue||All your work is really shaping the future of Sun Haven!
Dialogue||Of course! Just having a friend to talk to can do wonders for your mental health.
Dialogue||I suppose you're right. I never thought of it that way, but that's actually a huge responsibility.
Dialogue||That's not much of a tip.
Dialogue||Thanks Jun, you're so helpful!
Dialogue||All I can do is tell you what works for me, XX. What you do with that is up to you.
Dialogue||I do get a strong satisfaction from helping out whenever I can. Heh, I guess it's kind of my pastime.
Dialogue||Sweet XX, what is on your mind? You look somewhat troubled.
Dialogue||I've been thinking about our future quite a bit.
Dialogue||Are you happy in our relationship?
Dialogue||In truth, so have I. It may be silly, but I haven't been able to think about my own future in a long while. At least, not without also thinking of Sun Haven.
Dialogue||XX, I'm surprised at you! Are you having doubts? Or is this my fault?
Dialogue||If I've made you think that I'm unhappy with you, then you must know that I didn't intend it!
Dialogue||But now you can?
Dialogue||Do you see  afuture without Sun Haven?
Dialogue||Yes, I'm delighted when I think of the future here. Or as you put it, <i>our</i> future.
Dialogue||I know that I will never leave Sun Haven, but it's nice to have something other than being Archmage to look forward to.
Dialogue||Oh, no no. I know that I will never leave Sun Haven. But it's still nice to have something other than being Archmage to look forward to in the future. Or as you put it, <i>our</i> future.
Dialogue||I can't tell if you're really happy.
Dialogue||But are you happy enough... to stay with me forever?
Dialogue||All I can do is tell you the truth, XX. It's your decision to believe it or not.
Dialogue||Oh my goodness... XX, are you asking if I'm ready for marriage??
Dialogue||I can't think of anything that would make me happier, XX! When you think the time is right, I'll be waiting for you.
Dialogue||Sorry if I seem a little off. My aura is pinker than usual today.
Dialogue||Are you seeing anybody?
Dialogue||Catherine... I was hoping to ask you on a date.
Dialogue||Oh no, nothing romantic like that. I have plenty of friends, but just friends. I haven't had many romances in town, actually.
Dialogue||You were hoping to? Well... I hope you do too! Now would be a good time, if you're going to ask.
Dialogue||That's surprising to hear...
Dialogue||Well that's unsurprising.
Dialogue||Oh, surprising huh? XX, it almost sounds like you were hoping for that answer!
Dialogue||Oh, I didn't realize I was so undesirable to you. Good to know, XX.
Dialogue||Actually, I better not.
Dialogue||Let's go on a date together!
Dialogue||Oh, no? Well, all right XX. I'm just as happy to be your friend.
Dialogue||Oh my, what a surprise! Hehe, of course I'll go out with you XX! Meet me in front of my house tomorrow at 5:00 pm.
Dialogue||I heard a song from the record store and now it's stuck in my head, nyan...
Dialogue||The kids started calling me "Uncle Jun" today. They're so cute!
Dialogue||Hi, XX! Got any crops growing yet?
Dialogue||Let's talk!
Dialogue||So you're in charge of all the soldiers in Sun Haven?
Dialogue||With the military here I can't help but wonder, is Sun Haven in any danger?
Dialogue||Yes indeed, I'm Captain of the guard. The Sun Haven Corps includes some of the finest soldiers I've seen! In truth, I'm honored to lead them.
Dialogue||At the moment? No, not at all. The army established this outpost as a preventative measure, see. We're only here to make sure nothing bad walks into town.
Dialogue||What makes them stand out from other soldiers?
Dialogue||You care for them quite a bit.
Dialogue||You won't find soldiers with more spirit than those under my command. Even if there isn't a lot of fighting to do here, they manage to keep their chins up.
Dialogue||Of course! They're in my charge, which means I'm responsible for turning them into the strongest soldiers possible. That's a responsibility I don't take lightly.
Dialogue||It's comforting to have you here.
Dialogue||Somehow, that makes me feel less safe.
Dialogue||I'm happy we're here, too. Sun Haven is a gem of a city. I'm glad to protect it.
Dialogue||What, really? I don't see why.
Dialogue||You know, if you let me invest in your farm we could really increase production!
Dialogue||You think I need help on the farm?
Dialogue||Not everyone is so focused on productivity, Anne.
Dialogue||It's not about needing help, it's about expansion! Hire some workers, buy a little more land... I usually charge for this kind of advice, you know!
Dialogue||And not everyone gets to wear solid gold jewelry, but to each their own I guess!
Dialogue||I know you're just thinking about what's best for my future.
Dialogue||I don't need any of your help with my farm.
Dialogue||You're darn right I am! That's all I think about, you know. The future. Investments.
Dialogue||We've got a very long road ahead of us, XX, and I want to pave it with gold.
Dialogue||I know that, but - oh, forget it. Stubborn farmers...
Dialogue||Do you even like wearing all that jewelry?
Dialogue||I really shouldn't be surprised by that answer.
Dialogue||Hey, I have an image to protect! And that image is sparkly and expensive.
Dialogue||No, you shouldn't! I wear my priorities on my sleeve. And on my ears, and around my neck. Get it?
Dialogue||Hey there farmer! Spending some time with the sea today?
Dialogue||I have to ask... about the crab.
Dialogue||What's your opinion on Withergate?
Dialogue||The what? Oh! You mean Shelby?
Dialogue||That's the city that's supposed to be dark all the time, right? I hear a lot of tall tales from port to port, but Withergate might be the tallest tale yet.
Dialogue||That's an adorable name!
Dialogue||You named it?
Dialogue||She's the finest lady I ever sailed with. I was shipwrecked once and washed ashore. Shelby pinched me right on the cheeks and woke me up before the tide swept me out again.
Dialogue||She's my savior, and my first mate!
Dialogue||I named <i>her</i>, and she's the finest lady I ever sailed with.
Dialogue||I was shipwrecked once and washed ashore. Shelby pinched me right on the cheeks and woke me up before the tide swept me out again.
Dialogue||So you don't think it's true?
Dialogue||You aren't worried about the monsters, then?
Dialogue||I didn't say that. In my experience, it's best to be wary of these things, true or not.
Dialogue||Oh!
Dialogue||Sorry XX, I didn't see you there. I'm glad it's just you and not anyone else.
Dialogue||Is there anyone in Sun Haven you like to spend time with?
Dialogue||Claude... you're not dating anyone, right?
Dialogue||Aside from you, the answer's no. Some people are a bit more tolerable, I guess. But I don't think that's what you mean.
Dialogue||Huh? Why, um, do you assume that?
Dialogue||Eh... forget it. Of course I'm not.
Dialogue||I'm glad you have somebody, even if it's just me.
Dialogue||It's unhealthy for you to be so antisocial.
Dialogue||"Just you" is more than enough for me, XX.
Dialogue||Calling me out on how antisocial I am doesn't exactly put me in the mood for making friends, XX.
Dialogue||I was just wondering.
Dialogue||Will you go out with me?
Dialogue||Okay...
Dialogue||Oh... Are you sure? I don't want you to feel obligated. If you don't change your mind, meet me in front of my house at 5:00 pm tomorrow.
Dialogue||Tonya keeps me in shape with a good diet... but I sneak off to Liam's every now and then for a treat. Oh, don't tell!
Dialogue||Topi and Pod are fun to play with, but Pod cheats at hide-and-seek!
Dialogue||If you're not buying or selling, you're getting left behind.
Dialogue||Hello again, XX. Another beautiful day, don't you think? It's easier to work when the weather is nice.
Dialogue||What kind of work do you do here?
Dialogue||You seem like someone with a plan. What are your goals?
Dialogue||Herbal remedies are my specialty, but I also dabble in potions.
Dialogue||Honestly, I just want to see my city thrive again. I even go around town casting small enchantments to help bring some business back to town.
Dialogue||And you know... I wouldn't mind finding a cute partner in the meantime!
Dialogue||Is all of that safe?
Dialogue||Why come to you for remedies when we can just go to Dr. Wornhardt?
Dialogue||People have doubted my products before, but they change their mind when they actually try some. Here XX, take a sample!
Dialogue||Wornhardt is great at what he does, but he can't give the same boosts I can. Try some of my restorative herbs sometime and you'll see what I mean.
Dialogue||I'm sure you'll find someone soon, Catherine!
Dialogue||Why cast enchantments when Elios's magic helps the whole town?
Dialogue||Oh, you think? Do you know something that I don't, XX?
Dialogue||Just kidding, but thanks for the vote of confidence!
Dialogue||I guess that's the difference between us, XX. I can't just sit around while somebody else fixes things for me.
Dialogue||Um, hi... Who are you?
Dialogue||My name's XX. I'm the new farmer.
Dialogue||We have a new farmer? Nobody told me!
Dialogue||Come by the shop later, XX. I've got some great baked goods for you to try.
Dialogue||Ah, XX. I was hoping to find you. Would you be interested in a town survey?
Dialogue||Why are you doing a town survey?
Dialogue||I'll bite. Show me the survey, Jun.
Dialogue||It's nothing, really. I like to prepare little things like this from time to time, just to gauge how Sun Haven's citizens are feeling on certain topics.
Dialogue||Excellent. I'm glad you don't mind taking the time to help out! Sometimes people get too busy for this stuff, but that's okay, too.
Dialogue||Making Sun Haven the best it can be is a big part of why I do anything I do, so every voice counts!
Dialogue||Anyways, the survey is really just one question, but: What do you think of the town bulletin board?
Dialogue||You do too much, Jun!
Dialogue||I suppose that can be helpful information for your job.
Dialogue||Ah, it's not necessarily something for my job! I just enjoy knowing how everyone feels on things.
Dialogue||Sure, it comes back to help me as Counselor, but it's also just nice to get everyone's thoughts and feelings.
Dialogue||It's great! I don't have to talk to people as much.
Dialogue||It's a great way to see who needs help around town.
Dialogue||I see. So you value it for the purpose of not needing to directly interact with others. Not exactly the real purpose of the bulletin board, but I suppose it's just how you feel.
Dialogue||So you're saying you feel pretty positive towards it? That's good to hear, XX. I believe helping one another is the best way to build a strong community!
Dialogue||Hey XX, who do you think is a better caretaker? Me, or Kitty?
Dialogue||You know what, it's a pointless comparison. I shouldn't let her get in my head.
Dialogue||Well, she's not "Doctor Kitty," right?
Dialogue||You're experienced in caring for people, but what about pets?
Dialogue||Fair point, I guess I do have the certification. It's just that she said I need to give my patients more love. I just don't think it works that way with people.
Dialogue||Well sure, I've got my pet mouse. Have I told you about him? His name is Charlie! He's really smart, you'd be surprised.
Dialogue||Don't worry about Kitty, you know what you're doing.
Dialogue||You could be a warmer person.
Dialogue||Right, right. Of course, I just need to trust myself a bit more. Thanks for screwing my head on straight, XX.
Dialogue||You really think that? I try so hard to be friendly.
Dialogue||Why a mouse?
Dialogue||Mice are great pets!
Dialogue||Charlie was already in my house when I moved in, so I just bought him a cage and some food and we've been buds ever since.
Dialogue||I agree! Charlie's really easy to take care of, too. Aside from feeding, watering, cage cleaning, bath time, and health check-ups, he basically cares for himself!
Dialogue||At times, it seems like Sun Haven really is on its way back to normal.
Dialogue||The Moon Dragon once told me that I would forge a strong alliance to lead Withergate into the future. I had no way of knowing it would be with a resident of Sun Haven.
Dialogue||Do you think that means something?
Dialogue||Have you learned much from the Moon Dragon?
Dialogue||Who knows? It could mean a future alliance between our towns. Or, it could mean Withergate's conquest over Sun Haven, as well as the outlying towns.
Dialogue||There's really no telling. Perhaps I should confer with the Moon Dragon again.
Dialogue||Dynus is extremely knowledgeable, but he is no teacher. He granted me his blessing, which increased my strength well past its natural limits. Other than that, he simply keeps the skies dark.
Dialogue||I can't believe you would threaten to overthrow Sun Haven!
Dialogue||We will figure it out together, when the time comes.
Dialogue||If you let sentiment hold you back, XX, you will have a difficult time adjusting to leadership.
Dialogue||Precisely. You already have the makings of a true ruler, XX. You're ruthless and decisive, but you also know when patience is needed.
Dialogue||Dynus really doesn't help you lead Withergate at all?
Dialogue||It doesn't sound like he's much of a guardian.
Dialogue||Why should he? My father has done an acceptable job so far, and I will do an even better job of it. There's no use in a dragon getting involved in the city life of Withergate.
Dialogue||I would hold my tongue before speaking like that, for your own sake. If a guard heard you speaking like that, they would have to report it to Dynus.
Dialogue||There's no telling how he would react then - the Moon Dragon is both powerful and temperamental.
Dialogue||Hey, neighbor! I'm Doctor Wornhardt. You look plenty healthy to me, but come see me if you're feeling under the weather.
Dialogue||Wow, thanks! I'm XX, glad to meet you, doctor.
Dialogue||You can call me Wornhardt if you don't want to call me doctor. But really, I don't mind either way!
Dialogue||I don't think you realize just how lucky you are, XX. I have a lot of suitors, you know. But you're the only one who ever got a ring on me.
Dialogue||You had other suitors?
Dialogue||Putting a ring on you was no easy feat!
Dialogue||Well, they thought so. I never really had an interest in any of them despite the many, many gifts they sent me.
Dialogue||I've gained admirers in a lot of places, but all of them want me the same way they want a pile of gold. You're the only person who's made me feel wanted as a person and not a trophy.
Dialogue||Good! I've worked hard my entire life - it's time someone else worked hard for <i>me</i>!
Dialogue||When it comes down to it, it makes sense that the hardest worker won me over. And nobody works harder than a farmer!
Dialogue||Who needs trophies when I've got you?
Dialogue||You should have told me about these "suitors" earlier.
Dialogue||Heh, oh <i>please</i> get all sappy for me, XX. I think I'm warming up to your cheesy lines!
Dialogue||Really, XX? They were nothing to me, so why mention them?
Dialogue||We're married, remember? You don't need to be so insecure.
Dialogue||I could say the same about you, Miss Renowned Merchant.
Dialogue||I wasn't competing, I was only doing what I wanted to do.
Dialogue||Excuse me? That's <i>Mrs.</i> Renowned Merchant now!
Dialogue||That's the kind of thing that sets you apart from the others XX. Did you hear yourself? You weren't even competing! Oh my, what style, what class!
Dialogue||You've been with us in Sun Haven for a good time now, XX. You've truly become an integral part of our community!
Dialogue||Am I really that important to Sun Haven?
Dialogue||Is it hard to keep track of everyone living in town?
Dialogue||I couldn't imagine Sun Haven without a Kitty or an Emmett, or a <i>you</i>! Everyone is important, but more than that, everyone is a <i>part</i> of our town.
Dialogue||Sun Haven wouldn't be the same without you rushing up and down the streets, busy with your endeavours. I hope you plan to stay with us for a long time, XX.
Dialogue||It's not difficult at all. It's not only part of my job, but it's also something I'm genuinely interested in doing.
Dialogue||I may be Sun Haven's leader, but being leader is meaningless if I don't know the people I'm responsible for. It's a lot of work to keep track of everyone, but it's work I love.
Dialogue||I hope to stay here a long time, too.
Dialogue||Sun Haven is honestly pretty dull.
Dialogue||That's what I was hoping! You're part of the Sun Haven family now, you can't just up and leave us!
Dialogue||That really is too bad that feel that way, XX. If you ever left us, your presence would be sorely missed.
Dialogue||You're really a true leader.
Dialogue||That sounds about right, coming from you.
Dialogue||Oh, please. It's everyone in Sun Haven who inspires me. If not for all of you, I wouldn't be doing this!
Dialogue||Well, you have gotten to know me quite well, XX. I must finally be running low on surprises!
Dialogue||It's about time someone worthy came to me, even if it was from beyond Withergate's borders.
Dialogue||I've been in Sun Haven for a while now. If business keeps picking up, I may stick around longer than I thought.
Dialogue||I don't mind working long hours. It's going long hours without eating that really hits me.
Dialogue||There you are. I hope you're feeling well today. I slept weird on my neck, but I feel... better than usual.
Dialogue||You look nice and relaxed, Claude.
Dialogue||If I do, it's only because of you. You have me thinking about things other than my work. Sometimes it's nice to... unfocus.
Dialogue||Finding happiness is something I've had trouble with... but when it comes to you, it's been as natural as breathing. I actually can't believe how happy you've made me.
Dialogue||When I think about tomorrow, I don't just hear music. I hear your voice, XX.
Dialogue||Unfocus what?
Dialogue||So you actually feel better, too?
Dialogue||Just, myself. It's a relief.
Dialogue||I think I was working myself ragged before you started spending time with me. In fact, having something else to focus on has made my work a lot more productive.
Dialogue||Definitely. I think I was working myself ragged before you started spending time with me. In fact, having something else to focus on has made my work a lot more productive.
Dialogue||You should still focus on your music.
Dialogue||Is there room for both me and music in your life?
Dialogue||Is that really what you think? I see.
Dialogue||Fair question, heh. There's more than enough room for you. And if it came down to it, I see myself putting you before my music. You've come to mean that much to me.
Dialogue||I hope you don't think that sounds like too much, XX. I just don't see myself without anymore.
Dialogue||I never thought there'd be someone like you for me, XX.
Dialogue||Sun Haven is fortunate to have someone as capable as you. I'm fortunate, as well...
Dialogue||When I'm sculpting, I try to picture the sculpture inside the stone. Then I remove the bits that don't belong.
Dialogue||Solon acts a little gruff, but he's such a sweetheart. Ever since our marriage, he's seemed extra proud of me.
Dialogue||Solon is right to be proud of you.
Dialogue||Solon must see you kind of like a daughter.
Dialogue||You think so, XX? I've come a really long way with my skills since moving to Sun Haven, it's good to be recognized by two of the most important people to me.
Dialogue||It's so cute, but I think so too! Thinking back on it, when I first arrived in Sun Haven, Solon really seemed to help me settle in and adjust.
Dialogue||I didn't really recognize it at the time, but I think he really wanted to help me out. I'm so lucky to have found so many great people here!
Dialogue||Think you'll ever be better than your foremothers?
Dialogue||Think you'll ever be better than Solon?
Dialogue||Ohhh, now that I don't want to think about! My mother and grandmother are both so awesome at their work, I don't want to think of how far behind I still must be!
Dialogue||I'm just going to take it, one day at a time, and not focus on how far away I am! Solon is a great teacher, I know I'll get there someday.
Dialogue||Ohhh, now that I don't want to think about! Solon is probably the single most skilled blacksmith I've ever met! But, he <i>is</i> teaching me, after all.
Dialogue||Maybe it's inevitable that I'll surpass him eventually. The student becomes the teacher, right? Solon is a great teacher, so I know I'll get there someday.
Dialogue||I'm glad you found happiness in Sun Haven.
Dialogue||Don't you ever want something more?
Dialogue||I found more than just happiness. I found the rest of my life! I never wanted too much, but building a life with you and working with Solon is more than enough.
Dialogue||Ooh, I know, it's tradition for my village!! You can't ever tell my mother, alright? She'd never let me hear the end of it!
Dialogue||Maybe one day we'll get out of Sun Haven. What do you think, XX?
Dialogue||One step at a time, Claude.
Dialogue||I'm curious, where would you live if you weren't in Sun Haven?
Dialogue||You're right, I'm sorry. I haven't ever felt such excitement for the future. It's difficult not to indulge in fantasy.
Dialogue||If I had my choice, probably somewhere in the Northern Region. I hear the cold is unforgiving. There must be a song somewhere in all that cold.
Dialogue||I would never leave Sun Haven with you. This is my home.
Dialogue||It doesn't matter where, Claude, as long as we're together.
Dialogue||I see. I guess Sun Haven really grew on you. If I have to stay here longer, at least it's with you.
Dialogue||Everything you say to me is soothing to my mind. Right when my thoughts start racing, you come in and slow everything down. It's a really good thing for me, XX.
Dialogue||That's not what I expected at all.
Dialogue||That makes sense for you.
Dialogue||Well, the south is nothing but tourist trap islands. East and west are just more of the same. The north is the only place that offers anything different.
Dialogue||Excuse me if I seem short of breath, XX. I was just practicing some fireballs at home.
Dialogue||You practice fire magic in your house?
Dialogue||Lucia, how strong is your magic really?
Dialogue||Yes, I have a training area beneath my house. It's perfect for practicing my spells. Grandfather used to call them "fire drills."
Dialogue||The next time you visit my home, you should look closely at my owl statue!
Dialogue||As a matter of fact, I've mastered fire magic since I was blessed by Elios. But that doesn't quite answer the question, does it? Oh, I have a story for you!
Dialogue||A few years ago, I found a fledgling dragon tangled in brambles. It was quite scared, spouting flames in every direction. I wanted to help, but it wouldn't allow me to. So, I established dominance.
Dialogue||Every time the dragon spat fire my way, I responded with a larger burst of flame. Eventually, the young dragon submitted and allowed me to set it free!
Dialogue||A secret training area? Isn't that a little overboard?
Dialogue||You're like a hero from a novel!
Dialogue||It's not so much a secret as it is safe. It was important for me to have a safe place to practice when I was a child. Otherwise, half of Sun Haven may have burned down!
Dialogue||Oh! Hah, I don't know if I would say that. I only needed a safe place to practice when I was a child. Otherwise, half of Sun Haven may have burned down!
Dialogue||You beat a dragon? That's amazing!
Dialogue||That story doesn't make you sound so tough.
Dialogue||It was merely a fledgling, but still quite a challenge! Besides, you never really doubted my strength, right XX?
Dialogue||I'll keep that in mind the next time you're fighting a dragon!
Dialogue||I asked my dad if we could get a pet dragon. He said maybe!
Dialogue||I'm doing well today. Thanks for dropping by, XX.
Dialogue||I took a peek at your farm earlier - it's really coming together!
Dialogue||I just don't feel like talking right now.
Dialogue||I've been hearing a lot of talk lately. I think people know about us!
Dialogue||Does that worry you? I thought you weren't afraid of anything!
Dialogue||I've never been so popular!
Dialogue||What am I, some kind of action novel hero? Of course I have fears, XX. I'm just a person. But I'm not afraid of talk. Talk is just, talk.
Dialogue||No? First time for everything, I guess!
Dialogue||I'm used to this kind of attention, but that shouldn't surprise you. Getting people to talk about me is part of my business plan, after all.
Dialogue||Will you tell me what scares you, then?
Dialogue||And here I thought you lived fearlessly.
Dialogue||All right, sure. Part of me will always be afraid of losing everything, going broke, and living on the streets again. Also... crabs kind of freak me out.
Dialogue||Have you noticed that I stay away from Peter? Now you know why. I can't believe he lives with that sea bug on his head!
Dialogue||You're being weird, XX. I'm just a normal person like anyone else. Except, more successful and attractive.
Dialogue||You've always got a plan, huh?
Dialogue||Is the attention tiring?
Dialogue||Well, not always. To tell you the truth, a lot of the time I'm just making it up as I go. I just do well when the pressure is on! I bet you know what that's like, too.
Dialogue||Yes, in a way, but it's something I've lived with for years now. It's not going anywhere, and I refuse to let it run me down.
Dialogue||It feels good to talk about it a bit. I haven't had the chance to do that very much before you.
Dialogue||Now that we've been together so much, I'm starting to smell you in my clothes... I really love it!
Dialogue||What's on your agenda today, lovebug?
Dialogue||I want to cook you a special dinner soon. What is your favorite meal?
Dialogue||Oh, Solon is behind on a couple of custom orders, again, so I'll have to cover for him, again. Just another day at the forge.
Dialogue||Oh XX, you know this already!
Dialogue||Wait, you're doing his work now?
Dialogue||I can't believe you're doing Solon's projects for him!
Dialogue||Yes, but only when he's behind. I don't really mind since he gives me a bonus. And also...
Dialogue||People really think my work is his! You wouldn't believe how much of Solon's "master work" is actually mine.
Dialogue||It's only when he's behind. I don't really mind since he gives me a bonus. And also...
Dialogue||Creamy beef stew?
Dialogue||Spicy Ramen?
Dialogue||Wow, you really remembered! You're the best, XX.
Dialogue||Sorry sweetie, that's not it. Oh but don't worry! I don't blame you - I only told you once, after all. I love creamy beef stew, remember?
Dialogue||My favorite farmer! Are you feeling good today? I am!
Dialogue||You seem more cheery than usual.
Dialogue||You know, I keep thinking about that date we had...
Dialogue||I'm just excited. Excited because I have something special for you!
Dialogue||I do too, XX. Nobody has ever asked to spend time alone with me like that. I think about it a lot.
Dialogue||Don't keep me waiting - I can't handle the anticipation!
Dialogue||Oh Lynn, you didn't have to do anything for me.
Dialogue||Well, I wanted to make something for you but then I thought maybe you deserved something even more special. So, here.
Dialogue||This is my shield. It bears my family's crest, so please be careful with it. That means absolutely no using it in combat, please!
Dialogue||I want you to know, I think we should just stay good friends.
Dialogue||Let's go out again!
Dialogue||I see... That's fine, XX. I'm glad to be your friend!
Dialogue||I would love that! This time let's go to my house. Maybe come by around 5:00 pm?
Dialogue||I always wanted someone like you in my life.
Dialogue||I'm stocking white sand, all the way from the volcanic beaches of the Southern Islands! They say it has medicinal purposes.
Dialogue||I don't know about that, but it does sound like fancy sand.
Dialogue||Do you believe the sand really works as medicine?
Dialogue||Yes. It's super fine, even for your typical beach sand. Pure white, too.
Dialogue||Sailors say it looks like snow from a distance. And it even stays nice and cool in the sun!
Dialogue||Well... no. I think it's just white sand. Pretty sand, but still just sand.
Dialogue||But it's not like I'm the one who's calling it medicine! People can believe what they want, I just sell the goods.
Dialogue||It's like a touch of the south.
Dialogue||It would look pretty in a glass bottle.
Dialogue||Can I use that as a sales pitch? I'm using it as a sales pitch.
Dialogue||Hm. An interesting idea, very classy. Most people would call it "decorative art," but I just call it "an easy way to charge more than it's worth."
Dialogue||I wonder where I could source some fancy looking bottles... Hmm...
Dialogue||You just told me that people use it as medicine!
Dialogue||Calculating as ever, Anne.
Dialogue||No, I said <i>they say</i> it has medicinal purposes. That's totally different!
Dialogue||Aw, why thank you, XX. Wait, you <i>did</i> mean that as a compliment, right?
Dialogue||It's not like I'm the one who started the idea that the sand does anything, you know!
Dialogue||Sometimes I just reflect on my life and I wonder, how exactly did it end up so perfect?
Dialogue||You do what you have to and that's how you get by.
Dialogue||I'm going to be super tall one day soon!
Dialogue||Hello again. How's your day? I just got out of a session with a client, myself.
Dialogue||What did you and your client talk about?
Dialogue||How many people do you work with in Sun Haven?
Dialogue||Now that I can never tell you! Sorry, XX. It's really nothing personal, but I can not discuss clients with other people. It's all very private, you know.
Dialogue||I apologize if it comes off as strict, but I take that part of my job incredibly seriously.
Dialogue||Hm, well that's something I think would be okay to answer.
Dialogue||I work with lots of people, to put it broadly. Some of my clients I see weekly, but some I've only see once or twice as they work through an issue.
Dialogue||It doesn't matter how often they need me, though. I'm always here for whenever they do.
Dialogue||I understand, don't worry about it.
Dialogue||Boring. I wanna hear the juicy details.
Dialogue||Thank you. You won't believe how pushy some people can be about wanting to know who I talk to and about what!
Dialogue||Heh, people are just naturally curious, though.
Dialogue||I understand you might be curious, XX, but I can not violate a client's privacy. I admit I'm a bit disappointed you'd even ask...
Dialogue||Where do you find the time to make it all work?
Dialogue||Your schedule must be all over the place.
Dialogue||Sometimes I'm not even so sure! But it's all part of what I do. I have to find time for a client if I want to help them, after all.
Dialogue||It's true, I have a bit of a messy plate most of the time. But it's worth it, in order to accommodate everyone.
Dialogue||Yes, this is my natural hair color. Why does everyone ask me that? Catherine's hair is way more colorful!
Dialogue||So, what do you think? Am I a good husband so far?
Dialogue||It's barely been any time at all!
Dialogue||Where is this coming from?
Dialogue||I know, but I'm just trying to make sure I start on the right foot.
Dialogue||Well, I don't know. I've never been so involved with another person before. I guess I'm just feeling a little pressure now that we're married.
Dialogue||Do husbands worry too much? Because you're great at that.
Dialogue||You've got two right feet, Wornhardt.
Dialogue||Ouch, message received. I guess I won't bug you with my silly worries anymore.
Dialogue||What? That's not true... oh, I get it! Hah, that took me a sec. That's sweet of you, XX. Thanks for trying to cheer me up.
Dialogue||You're a doctor - all your work is done under pressure!
Dialogue||Don't try so hard. Just relax!
Dialogue||Heh, good point. I'm probably just dwelling on it too much.
Dialogue||Sorry if I'm out of breath... I've been running around town all day.
Dialogue||Hello there, farmer. Is everyone calling you farmer now? I could just call you XX if you prefer.
Dialogue||So... oh, did you want to talk?
Dialogue||Are you from Sun Haven, Liam?
Dialogue||What do you think about the Withergate rumors?
Dialogue||No, I moved here from the north. "The old and cold north."
Dialogue||That's, um, what they call it. In the north. Because it's so cold there.
Dialogue||Anyway, I'm glad to be out of the north. The girls and I really just needed somewhere warmer, both in temperature and community.
Dialogue||I'm not sure what to think, so I just try not to think about it at all. If something happens, I'm sure the army will have it under control. Probably.
Dialogue||Moving must have been hard on the girls.
Dialogue||You made the right call bringing them here.
Dialogue||It was, but we had to do it. I hope you don't think I'm a bad brother because of that.
Dialogue||I'm always doubting my decision, so a little affirmation goes a long way right now... thanks, XX.
Dialogue||It's lucky that the army is in Sun Haven.
Dialogue||Are you glad the army is here?
Dialogue||Sure it's impressive and safe and stuff, but it kind of freaks me out more than if they weren't here at all.
Dialogue||You've got a faraway look, XX. Is there something you want to talk about?
Dialogue||I'm thinking about our future.
Dialogue||Heh, it's kind of funny to hear you refer to our future, together. Maybe I'm still getting used to being in a relationship like this.
Dialogue||I don't know how I could be happier... Are you really worried about this?
Dialogue||XX, that's ridiculous! You have no reason to worry about me. I expect to be with you for a long time. Heck, maybe forever.
Dialogue||I hope we aren't moving too fast for you.
Dialogue||It's cute that you're still adjusting.
Dialogue||Absolutely not! Trust me XX, I'll let you know if I get really uncomfortable.
Dialogue||Aw, come on! Don't embarrass me in public, XX, or people might think I'm too soft.
Dialogue||Would you like that?
Dialogue||I don't know if I could do <i>anything</i> forever.
Dialogue||Oh! Heh, I didn't mean to say that so directly, but... Honestly, I would!
Dialogue||I don't want to rush you though. Just know that whenever you're ready, XX, then I am too.
Dialogue||Is that so? Well, maybe we've finally found the difference between us. As a soldier, commitment is no stranger to me.
Dialogue||XX, you're looking strong. That's good. I don't want the citizens to think that I waste my time with weaklings.
Dialogue||I've noticed people around town talking about us.
Dialogue||You used to think of me as a weakling, you know.
Dialogue||I'm the prince, of course people will talk. Let them. What have they got to say?
Dialogue||I know it's unfamiliar to you, but you belong to an exalted class now, XX. You're above the common folk. One of the elites.
Dialogue||That's true. Rarely, people can surprise you and rise above their position in society.
Dialogue||However, you're one of a kind, XX. I don't expect to find another like you.
Dialogue||I don't like thinking that way. I'm not better than other people.
Dialogue||I'm finally where I belong - next to you.
Dialogue||But XX, you are. No matter. You will eventually learn to embody your privilege soon enough.
Dialogue||I can't wait to rule with you at my side. The legacy we create together will be unprecedented.
Dialogue||I'm grateful that you can see my strength now.
Dialogue||It's all because you gave me a chance.
Dialogue||Thank goodness I had the patience not to lock you away immediately upon arrival. I really came close, you know!
Dialogue||Thank goodness I had the patience not to lock you away upon arrival. I really came close, you know!
Dialogue||Did you feel that? It was like a warm breeze suddenly rushed over me, all when I saw you.
Dialogue||Good day, XX!
Dialogue||Most people don't realize that being a parent is a full-time job all on its own.
Dialogue||You're doing great work, XX. Keep it up and you'll be where I'm at one day.
Dialogue||Sun Haven is so warm in the spring! Warm days make me want to curl up and nap alllll day long!
Dialogue||If you nap all day, who will manage the pet shop?
Dialogue||It does get pretty warm here in the spring.
Dialogue||Nya! Sometimes I wish I had no responsibilities, but then I remember someone has to take care of all the cute little pets!
Dialogue||Lots of sunny, sunny days in sunny, sunny Sun Haven! "Sun" is in the name after all, nya! Rain is nice, too, but it makes Kitty's ears and tail all wet!
Dialogue||The pets are lucky to have someone so dedicated.
Dialogue||Well, I hope you never forget.
Dialogue||Aw, you really mean that, XX? Kitty loves all the cute little animals. I would never abandon them! Just because it's warm doesn't mean Kitty HAS to nap!
Dialogue||Nya?! Kitty would <i>never</i> do something like that! XX must have lost their marbles! Just because it's warm doesn't mean Kitty HAS to nap!
Dialogue||Do you ever nap when it rains?
Dialogue||Where's your favorite place to nap?
Dialogue||Why would Kitty waste a rainy day like that?! When it rains, all the lil' worms come up out of the ground and then all the little birdies try to get 'em! It's so fun to watch!
Dialogue||That's why warm days are best for napping!
Dialogue||Oooh, good question! Sometimes Kitty likes to nap in a tree, or by Catherine's birdie bath! I tried to nap with the little chickie-chickens once, but it... didn't go so well, nyan...
Dialogue||It's strange, I've never been in a relationship before. But now I have you. It's nice.
Dialogue||You've never been in a relationship?
Dialogue||Does being part of a couple make you nervous?
Dialogue||No... Should I be embarrassed by that? Maybe I shouldn't have said anything.
Dialogue||I'm not nervous, but maybe a little uncertain. I don't really know what I'm supposed to do.
Dialogue||No, I'm glad you shared with me.
Dialogue||Don't be embarrassed.
Dialogue||Oh, good. I should have known that you wouldn't make me feel bad about it. I can really count on you, XX.
Dialogue||Honestly, I'm not. I never feel bad in any way around you.
Dialogue||Can't you just relax?
Dialogue||Don't worry about that. Just be yourself.
Dialogue||That's what I'm saying. I try, but it doesn't come so naturally to me. Just don't blame me when I let you down, XX.
Dialogue||Heh, myself. I've been trying to avoid myself for so long. But maybe you're right. I'll be myself... with you.
Dialogue||Have you been doing well, XX?
Dialogue||What to eat for dinner?? Mmmm... fish!
Dialogue||Oh, XX, just seeing you calms me down.
Dialogue||You're the new neighbor? Welcome to town.
Dialogue||I'm XX, nice to meet you.
Dialogue||My name's Camila. Oh, and nice meeting you too.
Dialogue||Ah, XX. There are days when I simply need to look into your face to calm myself down.
Dialogue||Has it been a rough day?
Dialogue||Do you really feel calm just by looking at me?
Dialogue||Xyla and Cordelia can't stop arguing about where to place a new water feature. I fear it will never see the light of the moon at this rate.
Dialogue||Hah! You love drawing compliments out of me, don't you? Fine, fine.
Dialogue||Yes, XX. The sight of your face dispels all unwanted distractions from my mind. It's something I noticed about you early on, actually.
Dialogue||They must really care about it.
Dialogue||Isn't one of them in charge of the other?
Dialogue||I'm not so sure. In truth, I sometimes think they fight with each other simply to assert dominance.
Dialogue||They both hold an equal position next to my father, you see, but neither of them can settle for that. So instead, they fight like children.
Dialogue||Actually, they both hold an equal position next to my father. But neither of them can settle for that, so instead they fight like children.
Dialogue||So you really liked me from the start??
Dialogue||The sight of you did the same for me, Darius.
Dialogue||As much as I tried not to, I still did. There, now you know. Don't go spreading the word, though. If everyone knew I was a "love at first sight" kind of guy, my reputation would never recover.
Dialogue||Is that so? Even from the beginning? Ah... I was hoping to make you fear me. I must be losing my touch.
Dialogue||Did you do your hair different? Wait, that's just the wind. Let me fix that for you.
Dialogue||Thanks Jun - but my hair will never look as good as yours!
Dialogue||Jun, I'm really enjoying getting to know you better. I think we should go on another date!
Dialogue||Ah! So you do like my hair after all? I've wondered what you think about it. Don't be afraid to tell the truth - I can take it!
Dialogue||I feel the same way. Talking to you is so easy, I can't explain it.
Dialogue||If you want the full truth, it is a bit much.
Dialogue||I love the style and color. It's perfect for you.
Dialogue||That's what you think? Maybe it's time for a change...
Dialogue||I'm starting to think<i>you're</i> perfect for me, XX.
Dialogue||Oh, I hope that wasn't too forward!
Dialogue||Then again, maybe a second date is a bad idea.
Dialogue||So that's a yes?
Dialogue||If that's how you feel, I'll respect that. But you should know, that's not how I feel at all.
Dialogue||I won't lie - I've been waiting for our second date ever since our first one ended. I would absolutely love to go out with you again, XX.
Dialogue||Meet me at my house tomorrow at 5:00 pm, okay? I'll see you there!
Dialogue||Before you ask, no I will not be your mentor. I work too much to be someone's role model!
Dialogue||Is there any role model you look up to?
Dialogue||I'd say you work too much, Anne. What would you even do on a day off?
Dialogue||I've got to respect Lucia's ability as a leader. I don't know how, but she's got this town wrapped around her magic little fingers.
Dialogue||Other than her? Probably my old mentor. At least, I used to.
Dialogue||Day off, huh? I can't imagine why I'd want a day off. I guess if I had to take a day off, I would spend it on the beach with a whole cheesecake to myself.
Dialogue||Oh, and at the bottom of the cake is a diamond!
Dialogue||You've never mentioned a mentor before.
Dialogue||I remember you talking about her before.
Dialogue||Actually, I have. Can't expect you to remember everything, I guess.
Dialogue||Actually, my old mentor was a man, but I don't think I told you that. Heck, I'm surprised you remember me mentioning him at all!
Dialogue||Don't you ever want a day off?
Dialogue||Cake on the beach sounds risky. What about the sand?
Dialogue||I don't like days that don't make me any money. Too many days like that and I don't eat.
Dialogue||A while back, I promised myself that I would never go to bed hungry again. I definitely intend to keep that promise.
Dialogue||XX, if you think a little sand would stand between me and a delicious raspberry cheesecake then you really don't know a thing about me. Besides, I've eaten some nasty food in my time.
Dialogue||It seems Xyla has made a mistake with the castle's plumbing. Completely unacceptable.
Dialogue||Xyla has always served you well, right? What's wrong?
Dialogue||Having trouble running the city?
Dialogue||She's made an error concerning some petty civic scheduling. A rare blunder for her, but an unacceptable one all the same.
Dialogue||Running Withergate is always a challenge. Which is why mistakes are not tolerated, no matter who makes them.
Dialogue||You should take it easier on her.
Dialogue||Well, small mistakes can add up.
Dialogue||Feh! "Take it easy on her?" Mercy is a key ingredient in laziness. Xyla's job is too important to allow her to slip up...
Dialogue||Today it might be a small blunder, then tomorrow it might be the city's undoing.
Dialogue||I'm glad you understand, XX. Maybe it makes me harsh, but so what? I'm not trying to be the nicest Demon in Withergate.
Dialogue||Sometimes the hand that rules must do so... sternly.
Dialogue||What about the times when you mess up?
Dialogue||Doesn't seem like such a big deal.
Dialogue||Don't you think I hold myself to the same standards? I can't make any mistakes, either. I am prince, soon to be king. Every problem is ultimately my responsibility.
Dialogue||I came to believe you had better foresight, XX. It seems, however, that you merely long for the days when your opinion meant nothing to me.
Dialogue||Dear me... I'm sorry XX, I'm particularly tired today. Topi, Pod, and Kitty ran into one of the traveling merchants' carts and made a huge mess. I spent the morning helping clean it up.
Dialogue||You didn't have to help clean it, you know.
Dialogue||Are you busy for the rest of the day, or can you recouperate?
Dialogue||Believe me, I know. I had those three troublemakers help too, but there was a lot to pick up. To make matters worse, there may still be damage to the cart itself.
Dialogue||Unfortunately, I'm quite busy today. It's no trouble, however - I'm sure I can find some relaxation time later tonight.
Dialogue||What were they doing??
Dialogue||Those kids are always playing, nonstop.
Dialogue||This time they were playing... what was it... "Jump Tag?"
Dialogue||It sounds like a combination of Leap Frog and Tag. Seemingly, it's a great way to knock over a mining merchant's cart!
Dialogue||Can't you just forget about one meeting?
Dialogue||You make being Archmage look easy.
Dialogue||Oh no, XX. Even if I did that and had the best nap of my life, I would just be that much more behind in my work. I would only end up more stressed and tired later.
Dialogue||Hah! Oh, thank you XX. It doesn't feel that way to me, but thank you. Let's keep up appearances for the rest of the town, shall we?
Dialogue||Hey, XX! You look absolutely radiant today.
Dialogue||You're laying it on pretty thick, eh doctor?
Dialogue||Hey, why do you have two stethoscopes?
Dialogue||That settles it - it's definitely weird of you to call me doctor now. Let's just stick to Wornhardt, yeah?
Dialogue||Well one is for work, but the other one is for you. I mean, if you want it. It's my old stethoscope that I wanted to give to you as a gift!
Dialogue||I prefer your real name, anyway.
Dialogue||Maybe I'll stick with "Doctor" just to bug you!
Dialogue||We're already on the same page. We'll really make it as a couple after all!
Dialogue||Try to push my buttons all you want, I'm not falling for it. I'm trained to be cool under pressure, remember?
Dialogue||What a thoughtful gift, thanks!
Dialogue||Oh! Why?
Dialogue||This is the first stethoscope I ever had. Without this, I wouldn't be where I am today.
Dialogue||I used to listen to my own heart with it. It was my way of reminding myself of what I live for. And now you're a part of that reminder, XX. So please keep it close!
Dialogue||For the endless source of inspiration you've given me, I will forever be in your debt.
Dialogue||Hi, XX! I'm always happy to see you around town.
Dialogue||Catherine, you're always so cheerful. Does anything make you mad?
Dialogue||Of everyone in Sun Haven, who do you prefer to spend your time with?
Dialogue||I know I seem very cool most of the time, but sometimes I do get fired up. It's usually when I see someone being unfair or cruel to another person.
Dialogue||I'll admit that I've cast my share of curses over people that I thought deserved it. That was only as a teenager, though.
Dialogue||Lucia and I have always gotten on very well. And believe it or not, I have a lot of fun with Anne. I don't know if she feels the same way, though.
Dialogue||I wish I could do that sometimes!
Dialogue||You can cast curses? Doesn't that mean you practice dark magic?
Dialogue||Oh, good. I was worried you might judge me for that!
Dialogue||Anyway, I've grown up since then. I don't take part in dark practices anymore.
Dialogue||I said it was only as a teenager, didn't I? I've grown up since then, XX. I don't take part in dark practices anymore.
Dialogue||You don't think Anne likes you?
Dialogue||Well, I always end up giving her some lecture about her morals. I used to be more serious about it, but I've started doing it for fun. Now I just like to push her buttons, hehe.
Dialogue||One day, we could be sailing away over the sea together.
Dialogue||Never approach any member of the elite unless beckoned.
Dialogue||Hi XX, I made some really nice armor today! I wish you could have seen it, but Solon already packaged it for shipment.
Dialogue||Sometimes I think I would really enjoy a life like yours. Farming sounds peaceful.
Dialogue||Your time in Sun Haven hasn't been peaceful?
Dialogue||You would make a good farmer, I think.
Dialogue||Good point - I'm not exactly on the front lines of a battle here.
Dialogue||But there's always that thought in my head. I have to be ready in case of any kind of emergency.
Dialogue||Sure, I could see that. There's honor in a simple life of hard work. Yeah, I could definitely go for something like that.
Dialogue||How do you find peace of mind, anyway?
Dialogue||I'm surprised you still stay so prepared.
Dialogue||I always space out when I'm staring at the ocean. Maybe my sailboat is out there somewhere, waiting for my service to end... That's a nice thought.
Dialogue||I've got to be, XX. I'm Captain, aren't I? What a humiliation it would be to be caught off guard here!
Dialogue||You would probably get too bored, though.
Dialogue||I would love to run a farm with you!
Dialogue||Give me some credit, XX. I don't need excitement every hour of every day. Heck, I've been in Sun Haven for five years without any major incidents.
Dialogue||Maybe one day, we can make that a reality. But for now, I have to fulfill my duty to the army and our people.
Dialogue||I grown to quite enjoy the peace and quiet of the town hall.
Dialogue||If you need anything, you know where to find me. Wait, do you know where to find me? You can find me at the bakery.
Dialogue||Emma and Elizabeth have been talking about getting a pet... Usually a plushie will get them to forget about it, but not this time.
Dialogue||Don't you want a pet?
Dialogue||Maybe you need a bigger plushie.
Dialogue||I would love a pet if I didn't have to take care of it at all. But my sisters are too young to care for an animal all on their own. I'm sure I would end up doing all the work.
Dialogue||Hm, I think I saw a giant teddy bear in the general store the other day...
Dialogue||Who am I kidding? We don't have the space for that. I might just need to wait for this to blow over.
Dialogue||You should play it safe to save yourself the headache.
Dialogue||You should trust your sisters with more responsibility.
Dialogue||That's exactly what I was thinking. I just feel so guilty always telling them "no." I guess that's what parenting is like, though.
Dialogue||XX, last week Emma lost her pants. In the middle of the day. One minute they're on her, the next minute they're gone.
Dialogue||Please don't talk like you know my sisters better than I do, XX. That's just not true.
Dialogue||Keep trying different plushies!
Dialogue||It'll be worth it!
Dialogue||You say that like I'm made of money, XX. I don't exactly account for plushies in my budgeting... but maybe I should?
Dialogue||I don't know, our house is already pretty cramped. Besides, it was a <i>very</i> expensive bear.
Dialogue||Unfortunately, I'm not made of money. I don't exactly account for plushies in my budgeting... but maybe I should?
Dialogue||I swear that I see you and hear music. Maybe you're my muse, XX.
Dialogue||Muse? What do you mean?
Dialogue||Nonsense, your inspiration is your own.
Dialogue||You haven't heard that term before? It means I draw inspiration from you, XX.
Dialogue||Ultimately, that's true. But it doesn't hurt to have a little outside help, too.
Dialogue||Does that mean vegetables are my muse?
Dialogue||I don't know what's so inspiring about me.
Dialogue||That's not... well, I guess anything could be a muse. But it's usually something a bit more, say, refined.
Dialogue||I don't know either, but that's not important.
Dialogue||A muse isn't meant to be figured out, it's meant to be a source of creative energy. And you, XX, are overflowing.
Dialogue||I will always help, however I can.
Dialogue||I'm afraid you're using me like a crutch.
Dialogue||All you need to do it be yourself. And you're good at that. Who knows what I'll produce with you around?
Dialogue||Even if I was, would that be bad? I don't see why. I just want to have you around me, all the time.
Dialogue||Keep an eye on your mailbox. You don't want to miss a letter!
Dialogue||Do you listen to music, XX? Listening to records is how I got into music to begin with.
Dialogue||What kind of music do you listen to, Claude?
Dialogue||Have you played music for a long time?
Dialogue||I usually listen to stringed instruments. Sometimes I'll draw inspiration from my records.
Dialogue||Music has been a companion to me my whole life, even when nobody else was. It feels like eons now...
Dialogue||I'd love to hear your favorite records, sometime!
Dialogue||Sounds kind of boring. I like loud music.
Dialogue||That's fine with me, but the music I listen to is boring.
Dialogue||You should ask Arvel at the record store for advice. He has a gift for pairing people with music.
Dialogue||I guess you're not wrong. You should ask Arvel at the record store for advice. He has a gift for pairing people with music.
Dialogue||I think I see why you feel so strongly about your work.
Dialogue||What do you mean by that?
Dialogue||I don't want to get into it right now, but there's good reason that I shoot for perfection in my music.
Dialogue||Is it me, or does it seem like just yesterday we were riding the train into town together? Don't say it's just me!
Dialogue||Time has flown since we got here.
Dialogue||I think we've both grown as people.
Dialogue||XX... do you think you'll stay here after all? Or are you just passing through, like any other traveler?
Dialogue||Oh, I agree! XX, it has been an adventure here. I know I've said it before, but I'm truly glad that we started this adventure together!
Dialogue||I'm going to leave one day.
Dialogue||I'm not going anywhere.
Dialogue||Oh... well, that's your choice. I thought we might stay friends here for a while longer, but you should do what's best for yourself.
Dialogue||Oh, yay! Heh, maybe it's silly but I hate to imagine you leaving. You're the first friend I made here and... well, that's special to me.
Dialogue||You've become a stronger person since then.
Dialogue||I've become a stronger person since then.
Dialogue||Thanks for saying so, XX. Not to get a big head, but I agree! Working with Solon has really shaped me as a blacksmith.
Dialogue||Honestly - and don't tell him I said this! - at first I thought I would <i>hate</i> Solon for how tough he is as an instructor. But now I've almost made it, thanks to him.
Dialogue||You definitely have! Not to get a big head, but I feel like I've grown the same way too. Working with Solon has really shaped me as a blacksmith.
Dialogue||I don't mind lending assistance, but I am quite busy.
Dialogue||Do you look around when you walk places? I find treasures all the time!
Dialogue||Sometimes I think of visiting the Northern Region again. Then I think about it some more and... well, I haven't ever gone.
Dialogue||Hello XX! Oh my, you appear to have gotten a little too much sun. Your cheeks are extra rosey today!
Dialogue||I may have sat a little too close to the fire on our date...
Dialogue||You have such fair skin. How do you keep from getting sunburns?
Dialogue||I was thinking about that. XX, I had a wonderful time with you on our date. I would be delighted to go out again!
Dialogue||I used to get sunburns all the time, but now Catherine gives me a homemade sunblock. It works remarkably well!
Dialogue||I don't think that's a good idea.
Dialogue||I would love that!
Dialogue||Oh dear, my apologies XX. I must have simply misread the situation.
Dialogue||Fantastic! Meet me outside of my house tomorrow night at 5:00 pm. I can't wait, XX!
Dialogue||I assumed it was because of your magic.
Dialogue||Are you saying that Catherine's magic is as strong as yours?
Dialogue||Not everything I do is done magically, you know. Although, Catherine's salves certainly work like magic!
Dialogue||Actually XX, I'm talking about her herbalism practice and not her witchcraft. She makes many helpful potions without relying on any spells! She's quite remarkable.
Dialogue||Oh, I'm just thinking of all the ways I'll make your insolence come back to bite you.
Dialogue||It's a relief to see the town doing so much better these days.
Dialogue||Ahh, the shipment of tombmelon wine has finally arrived. How timely.
Dialogue||Do you enjoy wine?
Dialogue||Tombmelon wine? Could I learn to make that?
Dialogue||You were expecting me to drink anything less? For someone of my status, it's either wine or thirst.
Dialogue||I would never lower myself to anything else. So to say I "enjoy" wine is a wild understatement.
Dialogue||I'm sure you might be an eager cook, XX, but this is something you'll never learn to make. The recipe is known only to Withergate's royal vintners.
Dialogue||It is a drink of Demon royalty, as it has been for one thousand years and shall be for countless thousands more.
Dialogue||I would expect as much from you.
Dialogue||You have such a refined taste.
Dialogue||You've learned much about me, XX. Maybe the most important thing you've learned is to never question what I say.
Dialogue||Come to think of it, it's definitely the most important thing.
Dialogue||This wine must be very important to your family.
Dialogue||Wine from a melon sounds pretty weird, anyways.
Dialogue||There are two worlds, XX. My family and our allies live in one, and everyone else lives in the other. We are separated by a fundamental culture.
Dialogue||From how we dress, how we speak and even what we eat and drink. That is the difference between you and I. You do not have to understand it, but you will have to recognize it.
Dialogue||You've the taste of a low-born, XX. Your opinion on the subject is irrelevant.
Dialogue||Since we've been together, I've been thinking of you constantly. I'm even starting to picture our future together!
Dialogue||You're looking at me funny...
Dialogue||Something I've been wondering - does it bother you that I'm just a farmer?
Dialogue||I'm just excited!
Dialogue||XX, I have something for you. It's a gift. I want you to keep it with you always, okay?
Dialogue||Oh, you're so adorable. It doesn't matter what your job is - I don't mind one bit. All that matters is that <i>you're</i> happy with your job... and with me.
Dialogue||What is it?
Dialogue||I promise to keep it safe.
Dialogue||It's my journal where I keep all my thoughts and ideas - please take it! Consider it my way of sharing my thoughts with you.
Dialogue||You always put me at ease, Jun.
Dialogue||I feel the same way - I don't care about your work either.
Dialogue||I'm always here if you need an ear.
Dialogue||That's a little rhyme I say to my clients. Isn't it cute?
Dialogue||Well, it sounds a bit different to say that you don't care...
Dialogue||How do you like it here?
Dialogue||What do you like to do for fun here?
Dialogue||Sun Haven's a fine town. I moved here a few years ago since houses were affordable. Saved me a lot of money!
Dialogue||I just enjoy the town. I don't like big city life, but walking around Sun Haven is perfect. Even the guards are nice to talk to. Except for Calvin...
Dialogue||It sounds like you don't actually care that much for Sun Haven.
Dialogue||It's lucky you moved here at the right time, then.
Dialogue||Don't jump to conclusions.
Dialogue||It was luckier than you think - I would have been homeless if not for this place.
Dialogue||What's wrong with Calvin?
Dialogue||I agree, Sun Haven feels like the perfect size.
Dialogue||Have you spoken to him? He's a major downer.
Dialogue||Whoever planned the city must have put a lot of thought into it!
Dialogue||Why is it that everyone insists on talking to me when I go out?
Dialogue||I imagine you must have met almost everyone in town by now. I hope you're getting along well!
Dialogue||Do you hang out with people when you're not working?
Dialogue||Citizens aside, who do you think is the best guard in town?
Dialogue||Of course! In truth, those are the only times when I feel like a citizen of Sun Haven and not just its leader.
Dialogue||I love to hear Nathaniel and Roza's bantering. I grew up with Catherine, so we know each other quite well. Kitty is rather energetic, but she means well. Actually, the same can be said of Anne.
Dialogue||I try my best to get to know my citizens. I don't always have time for everyone, but I cherish the time I do get.
Dialogue||Such a divisive question could start a squabble, you know. However... between just you and me, Sophie excels as a soldier.
Dialogue||Please don't tell anyone I said so, as I would hate to discourage the soldiers protecting our town.
Dialogue||This might be the most excited I've seen you. It's very sweet!
Dialogue||A leader should keep some distance from her citizens.
Dialogue||You're very sweet, XX. I'm happy you've decided to join our family. As far as I'm concerned, that's exactly what Sun Haven is - one big family!
Dialogue||I know that's a cliche, but some cliches are true!
Dialogue||I won't apologize for being passionate about my friends here. That's what I love most about being Archmage - I get to know everybody!
Dialogue||I won't tell anyone that you're playing favorites!
Dialogue||I was going to say the same thing!
Dialogue||Oh, shush! I know you're joking, but I really don't want to hurt anyone's feelings.
Dialogue||That's quite enough gossip for now. As I said, I do not want to hurt anyone's feelings.
Dialogue||Life is weird. It feels like no time at all has gone by since we moved here, but it's already been years.
Dialogue||What are your future plans?
Dialogue||Do you think fate brought you here?
Dialogue||Future plans? Sheesh, I have trouble planning dinner. I'm just taking everything one step at a time right now. If I had to make a whole life plan, I might black out.
Dialogue||Fate? Wow, big question. I don't know if I even believe in fate.
Dialogue||Then again, it's hard for me to think that things just happen for no reason. So maybe I do believe in fate... What do you think?
Dialogue||Don't you think it's important for your sisters that you make a plan?
Dialogue||Sometimes we have to take life as it comes, and that's okay!
Dialogue||Oh. Maybe? I hadn't thought about that.
Dialogue||Maybe I bit off more than I could chew by trying to raise them. Am I a bad brother?
Dialogue||Oh, I wonder if Jun has availability today...
Dialogue||Wow, for a moment it felt like I was in a session with Jun. For some reason you're really easy to talk to.
Dialogue||Everything is a coincidence and nothing happens on purpose.
Dialogue||I think everything happens for a reason.
Dialogue||Wow, XX. You really, uh, lay it all out there. I can admire your certainty, that's for sure.
Dialogue||Yeah, yeah exactly. Even if it's not true, it's a comforting thought.
Dialogue||Is it just me, or is the air sweeter these days?
Dialogue||I knew great things were in store for Sun Haven. I just didn't expect them for myself, too!
Dialogue||You're the new neighbor Lucia told me about? I'm Tonya, glad to meet you.
Dialogue||Good to meet you too! I'm XX.
Dialogue||You're living on the farm, right? I'm the town's courier, so I'll be delivering your mail there.
Dialogue||I hope my mouse Charlie isn't a problem for you. I think he'd like you!
Dialogue||I had fun with my barn animals this morning! I wish you saw, XX. They're so snuggly...
Dialogue||By the way, why do you love animals so much?
Dialogue||What's your dream pet, Kitty?
Dialogue||They're so sweet and funny. And did you know each one has their own unique personality? Plus plus, I can talk as much as I want and they don't leave as long as I have food for them.
Dialogue||Ooooh, dream pet? XX, that's a tough tough question... No it's not! A White Lion would be my top top choice.
Dialogue||White Lions are majestic and fast and strong - just like me! Except, maybe stronger... and a loooot bigger.
Dialogue||You really think of them as friends, huh?
Dialogue||It sounds like you treat them very well!
Dialogue||Aw, of course! What else would they be? They're some of my best friends, nya!
Dialogue||Are you sure you could handle a White Lion?
Dialogue||You would be the perfect friend for a White Lion!
Dialogue||If anyone can, it's Kitty. No doubting, XX!
Dialogue||Yes, friend! Exactly! XX, you really really understand my relationship with animals. Maybe that's why we have such a good relationship too!
Dialogue||Some people hate the feeling of dirt underneath their fingernails. Me? I love it.
Dialogue||Hey, don't you ever think it's a little crazy?
Dialogue||I mean, that we met each other on the train to our new lives in Sun Haven. And now here we are, together like this. Do you think it was fate?
Dialogue||Fate or not, I'm glad I'm with you.
Dialogue||I don't know if I believe in fate, either, but I think it's very romantic. We were both the town newcomers. For some people, that's a really hard thing to adjust to.
Dialogue||For you and me, though, it was the start of all of this!
Dialogue||I'm happier than I ever thought I could be. With you, with Sun Haven, with my job. No matter how much I sometimes miss home, I'm so happy I'm here.
Dialogue||When I first came to Sun Haven I wasn't sure if I'd be here for longer than a few years. Now, I don't want to think of ever leaving. Especially leaving you, XX.
Dialogue||...When I think of the future, it's you on your farm and me... as your wife, XX!
Dialogue||Maybe it really was fate that put us on the same train.
Dialogue||I'll never forget the train we met on, at any rate.
Dialogue||Heheh, either fate or good timing! Maybe we'll never know for sure, but that's okay, XX. We're together now.
Dialogue||Me either. I was still so nervous that day. Meeting you helped me feel a lot easier, so maybe it was only natural we bonded so well. It's still romantic, though!
Dialogue||I see.
Dialogue||I see the same thing.
Dialogue||Maybe you don't feel the same way right now? It's okay, XX. I'm going to be here for you, as soon as you do.
Dialogue||Oh, XX, I don't even know what to say right now!! I won't rush you... just try and surprise me, okay?!
Dialogue||I found a anthill under the tree over there. I want to show Emma!
Dialogue||Are you good friends with Emma?
Dialogue||You should ask Liam if she can come over.
Dialogue||Yeah! Except her brother Liam doesn't let her play as much as me and Topi. I wish we were neighbors too.
Dialogue||But then Elizabeth will come over too. Topi has a crush on Elizabeth and then he doesn't play with me. I hate it!
Dialogue||Do you see her in school?
Dialogue||You think she would like the anthill?
Dialogue||Yes, but we don't get to look at anthills in school.
Dialogue||Yeah I know it! She likes bugs and cool stuff like that.
Dialogue||Think of it this way - then you get more time to play with Emma.
Dialogue||You need to let him play with Elizabeth too.
Dialogue||I guess so. Emma is fun too. Sometimes she brings breads that her brother made and they taste sweet!
Dialogue||Nooooo... Why is everything so hard?
Dialogue||How's the farm treating you, XX? I can't imagine the labor of keeping up a farm!
Dialogue||Why were you wondering about my farm?
Dialogue||You work pretty hard, too.
Dialogue||Oh, come now, don't give me that look! I'm not <i>always</i> trying to get something from you. I like to chat, too.
Dialogue||Sure, but I've come a very long way from doing any of my own dirty work. You're out there everyday, working in the dirt.
Dialogue||Truth be told, the only physical labor I want to do is counting my money.
Dialogue||Sometimes it's hard to tell with you.
Dialogue||I've learned to play it safe with you.
Dialogue||Is that so? Good! I try to keep people on their toes. I don't want people thinking they've figured me out, because then they think they can haggle with me.
Dialogue||Sounds like you've found your true calling.
Dialogue||On second thought, you sound kind of lazy.
Dialogue||That's true, this is who I am. And I wouldn't change that for anything, not even a mountain of gold.
Dialogue||Well that's the funny thing about thoughts. You can have as many of them as you like, but it doesn't mean they're any good.
Dialogue||Maybe I could really start thinking about a pet for Emma and Elizabeth now that we're married.
Dialogue||Reading tea leaves is fun, but my favorite part is drinking the tea!
Dialogue||It feels like my life is really coming together. You're a big part of that, XX.
Dialogue||Lynn, I love you, but...
Dialogue||You know, sometimes I wonder if I should have chosen a different profession.
Dialogue||But what? Don't keep me in anticipation, XX!
Dialogue||Oh, sweet XX. When I started my apprenticeship, I was terrified! You remember, right? I constantly doubted my choice to move here.
Dialogue||Now I'm almost at the end of my apprenticeship and I've learned almost everything Solon has to teach. What I'm trying to say is, just give it some time, sweetheart.
Dialogue||When you come home from the forge, you stink. Real bad.
Dialogue||Would you mind taking a bath after you get home from the forge?
Dialogue||Well good, that's how you know I worked hard all day. I'm glad I stink!
Dialogue||Oh dear, I must smell like a sweat golem after a day's work! I'm glad you mentioned it, XX. I'll make sure to wash up when I get home.
Dialogue||That's not the same. I'm not a blacksmith.
Dialogue||I don't know what I'd do without you, sweet pea.
Dialogue||XX... I know you'll understand soon.
Dialogue||Oh stop, you'd be just fine on your own. And me, too. In a way, that's what makes us such a strong couple.
Dialogue||You're lucky you get to play on a farm all day!
Dialogue||You know that what I do is hard work, right?
Dialogue||You get to play all day too, right?
Dialogue||Sure, but it's fun because you get to play in dirt and mud and stuff too. Right?
Dialogue||It's not the same. When I get too dirty then I get in trouble with my mom.
Dialogue||I try not to get too dirty.
Dialogue||That's right, farming is a lot of fun!
Dialogue||Figures, adults are always so boring.
Dialogue||I knew it! I want to be a farmer too now, just like you, XX.
Dialogue||Your dad doesn't care?
Dialogue||Just clean up before your mom gets home.
Dialogue||He's usually dirty too, hehehe.
Dialogue||Ooh, that sounds like something Pod would say. You're real smart, XX!
Dialogue||Sometimes I feel my witchcraft isn't... up to snuff, compared to the Blessed like Lucia.
Dialogue||Your witchcraft is very useful.
Dialogue||What can someone who's been blessed do that a witch can't?
Dialogue||Heh, thank you, XX. I think so, too. I just sometimes see one who has been blessed and their raw power makes my craft seem so humble in comparison.
Dialogue||Witchcraft is a lot more reserved than the magic you see someone who's been blessed do.
Dialogue||We don't shoot fire or conjure lightning, it's more about reading the natural auras of living things. Being in tune with life, and working off of that energy.
Dialogue||You just have to focus on what you're good at.
Dialogue||Even the Blessed feel this way sometimes.
Dialogue||I guess you're absolutely right. I'm usually so confident with my ability, but we all doubt ourselves sometimes, right? Even Lucia must! Thanks for hearing me out.
Dialogue||Maybe you can ask Elios to give you his blessing?
Dialogue||Maybe it's not as flashy, but your witchcraft is still worth appreciating.
Dialogue||I wouldn't want to do anything like that, XX. I don't want to give up who I am.
Dialogue||I know, and you're right. I guess that's what I really like about it. I don't have to be big and showy, I'm a witch!
Dialogue||Hiiiii! I'm Kitty! You must be that new farmer in town, nya nya!
Dialogue||That's right, I'm the farmer. My name's XX.
Dialogue||XX, XX! So happy to meet you, nya.
Dialogue||You should know, the girls are ecstatic about us. In fact, they're a little <i>too</i> excited.
Dialogue||It was almost impossible getting them to bed last night!
Dialogue||Sometimes even I can't sleep when you're on my mind.
Dialogue||Your sisters are a delight, Liam.
Dialogue||Oh yeah? Heh, I don't really have that problem.
Dialogue||Not that I'm not excited - I am, very much so! I just mean that sleep usually hits me like a centibeetle. I knock out quick.
Dialogue||I want you to know that I'm excited about us, but I think I'm making it worse by explaining more. Ah...
Dialogue||You really think so? That's good to hear. I sometimes worry that I'm not bringing them up right.
Dialogue||You're adorable, Liam.
Dialogue||You're making it worse by explaining more.
Dialogue||Huh? Uh, okay! I don't know what I did, but I'm glad that it... worked?
Dialogue||Ugh, I know... Sorry.
Dialogue||I guess time will tell, huh?
Dialogue||With you as their guardian, I'm sure they will be great.
Dialogue||Yeah, I know... sometimes I wish time would hurry up, though!
Dialogue||You always say the right thing, XX. How do you even do that? Seriously, can you teach me? I am... not joking.
Dialogue||My mom gave me a gold coin, but I lost it on the beach... Don't tell!
Dialogue||What's that? Oh, yes the carrot in my hat is real. What can I say, I like to have snacks on hand. Or, head!
Dialogue||Hi, I was just thinking about you today while hammering some armor into shape.
Dialogue||Oh dear, I hope that doesn't send the wrong message...
Dialogue||You must be doing a lot of hammering - you're looking stronger than you used to.
Dialogue||Did you also make that pauldron on your shoulder?
Dialogue||Do you think so? I always thought my arms were so skinny. My daddy used to call me Twiggy because he said my arms were like little twigs. I never really liked it that much.
Dialogue||This? It was a parting gift from my mother before I moved here. She always makes my armor just a liiittle too big... Oh, I wish I could hug her right now!
Dialogue||Twiggy?? I've got to use that!
Dialogue||That name doesn't really fit anymore.
Dialogue||Oh no - I shouldn't have told you that!! I <i>really</i> don't like that name.
Dialogue||I have gained a little muscle, but I know I'm still quite small. I really do feel stronger, though!
Dialogue||Is your mother working as a blacksmith, still?
Dialogue||Was she worried about your safety?
Dialogue||She did, but now she only smiths for fun. In a way, that makes my pauldron seem even more special!
Dialogue||Oh no, not at all. Most people wear decorative armor back home.
Dialogue||It's cute that you think this little piece would offer any real protection!
Dialogue||Hey XX, looking good today!
Dialogue||When we met, I thought you would be good for Sun Haven's future. I never imagined that my own future would change, too!
Dialogue||Peter called me a fireball today. Does that sound like a compliment? I can't tell.
Dialogue||Feeling well today, XX? I'm trying out a new sculpting medium, myself.
Dialogue||What is a sculpting medium?
Dialogue||What is your latest sculpture?
Dialogue||It's a fancy way of saying "the stuff I'm sculpting with." Usually I use dirt clay, but you can make sculptures out of just about anything that can be molded.
Dialogue||Today I'm using bread dough. No, really! Sculpt the dough, then bake it, and just like that you've got a bread sculpture!
Dialogue||I want to get better at capturing living things in sculpture, so I've tried with some small animals. Birds and squirrels, mostly. But I want my next piece to be more ambitious... Maybe Elios?
Dialogue||Does it taste good?
Dialogue||I had no idea you could sculpt something out of dough.
Dialogue||I'm not sure. When I bought the dough from Liam, he said I probably shouldn't eat it. But that just makes me want to eat it more... Who says I don't starve for my art!
Dialogue||You can sculpt with all sorts of different things. Wet sand works real well. I love making castles with Topi when we go to the beach.
Dialogue||I bet Elios would be honored if you sculpted him.
Dialogue||I don't think you could pull that off.
Dialogue||He's a mighty guardian, but he also strikes me as very humble.
Dialogue||Maybe when I finished the sculpture, I could travel to Dragon's Meet and show it to him? Nah, I'd be too nervous...
Dialogue||I can't tell if you're being serious, or just trying to motivate me... Anyway, failure isn't a bad thing. It's how people learn. Trust me - I've learned a lot over the years!
Dialogue||It's almost uncanny how well you fit into Sun Haven. We're all the better for it.
Dialogue||I'm bored lately, XX. Maybe I need a new project to focus on?
Dialogue||What project are you most proud of?
Dialogue||Do you have any goals you're working toward?
Dialogue||I'm so so proud of my dress. I made it to match my ears and tail - can you tell, nya??
Dialogue||Well, since we last talked about it, I'm secretly training to get back in shape like I was when I performed in the carnival. But don't tell, nya! It's between you and me, okay??
Dialogue||Your dress is... unique.
Dialogue||You have a great eye for design!
Dialogue||Huh? Is that it, XX? You don't really like it, nyan...
Dialogue||Ah no, don't say that - I'm just average! You're too too nice to me, XX. Thank you for always making Kitty happy, nya!
Dialogue||Why are you doing that?
Dialogue||Why is it secret?
Dialogue||It makes me better at climbing and jumping, which are two of Topi and Pod's favorite ways to play. I want to show them how good I am!
Dialogue||It's a surprise for Topi and Pod! Sometimes Kitty plays with them, running and jumping. Very very soon I'll be able to show them the best jumps ever!
Dialogue||I'm thinking about my next birthday, I just can't decide what to get my littermates.
Dialogue||Why would you get your littermates something for <i>your</i> birthday?
Dialogue||I didn't know your birthday was coming up.
Dialogue||Oh, well, it's their birthday too. We were all born on the same day, after all! It's tricky since there are seven of them...
Dialogue||Oh, my birthday actually isn't for awhile! But with so many littermates, it takes all year to plan what I'm going to get for everyone.
Dialogue||I want to go above and beyond so that everyone is happy, but it gets harder each year. I'm really struggling this time!
Dialogue||Your mom had eight kids at once?!
Dialogue||Is that the same for all Amari?
Dialogue||Well, yeah. What do you think a "litter" means, exactly? Some Amari might give birth to a single baby, others will have entire litters!
Dialogue||Nope! Some Amari might give birth to a single baby, while others will have entire litters!
Dialogue||You could tell them their fortunes!
Dialogue||Yeah, good luck with that.
Dialogue||I love that idea!
Dialogue||Oh, but my littermates don't really like my witchcraft... too many pranks as a kid, hehe.
Dialogue||Right, thanks for all the help...
Dialogue||Hey XX, do you know what I am? I'm the happiest Kitty alive!
Dialogue||What has you so happy?
Dialogue||Is this really the happiest you've ever been?
Dialogue||Don't act like you don't know! You're just teasing Kitty, nya!
Dialogue||Hm, I think so. The only other time I can think of is when I was in the circus. Kitty slipped off her rope and fell very very far to the ground, nyan.
Dialogue||I thought everyone would be disappointed, but they all cheered for me when I landed on my feet!
Dialogue||I'm only joking, Kitty!
Dialogue||You think it's fun, too!
Dialogue||Teehee, I know that! XX is very silly, but very fun too. It's why I love you!
Dialogue||A mistake is nothing to be happy about.
Dialogue||That's amazing, Kitty!
Dialogue||Mm, I disagree! Turning a mistake into a happy moment is a great thing, nya! Maybe you just don't understand?
Dialogue||Because Kitty wasn't hurt? It's normal for me! I fall all the time and haven't been hurt not once, nya!
Dialogue||I think I feel a blister on my foot. I'll have to address it as soon as I can, an infected blister is no good.
Dialogue||Who treats the soldiers when you're wounded?
Dialogue||If you could change something about Sun Haven, what would it be?
Dialogue||Oh, you mean like blisters on the foot? Heh. All of our medical aid is provided by the local hospital, Doctor Wornhardt does a great job with us.
Dialogue||Thankfully we don't normally need much more than that, though we do have a few soldiers trained as medics. Field medics don't quite have the finesse of a doctor, though.
Dialogue||Hm, that's a pretty big question. Well, let's see...
Dialogue||I love cozy little Sun Haven, but if there's one thing I miss from my time in the Great City, it's all the roads being stone!
Dialogue||Stone roads are harder than dirt, but much smoother. All these rough dirt roads give me blisters!
Dialogue||I'm glad you all get taken care of.
Dialogue||Using the town doctor seems lazy on the military's end.
Dialogue||Yeah, the military is very generous when it comes to our medical care. It's one of the best things about the army life, actually. I never have to worry about medical bills!
Dialogue||I have no idea why you'd feel that way. Wornhardt is a great physician, and he's entirely local. It makes the most logistical sense for the military to send us his way.
Dialogue||Sun Haven probably isn't big enough to justify paved streets.
Dialogue||Lucia would never agree to budget out paved streets.
Dialogue||Yeah, I've long since given up hope of anything like that. Ah well, blisters are just an occupational hazard.
Dialogue||Look sharp, XX! Hah, I'm only kidding. There's no reason to look sharp much these days. Life in Sun Haven has been very ho-hum lately.
Dialogue||What do you do all day if things are so slow?
Dialogue||There's plenty of monsters to fight outside of town.
Dialogue||Well, there's still plenty to do, even if times are peaceful. At any moment there could be danger. Well, theoretically, at least.
Dialogue||But still, I have rounds to make, training to oversee, schedules to draft... let's see, I do armory count each week, I sign off on supply orders... all sorts of boring stuff, really.
Dialogue||This is true, but admittedly I'm not one to really go out of my way to seek a fight. Still, though, maybe it'd be fun to cut loose and rid the forests of a few dozen monsters.
Dialogue||If it's boring, then why do it?
Dialogue||I never knew you took care of so much stuff.
Dialogue||Just because a task is boring doesn't mean it's not important. I thought a farmer would be the type of person to really understand that.
Dialogue||My plate is often pretty full, I'll say that much. But that's okay! It's my duty, and so it's what I do. Labor now, question later.
Dialogue||Make it a training exercise for your soldiers!
Dialogue||So take a day off and have some fun.
Dialogue||That might not be such a great idea, though. Some of them, like Roza or Sophie, I could trust without ever thinking twice.
Dialogue||Some of the others, though, may not quite be ready for extreme training like that. Until then, I'll just keep up my busy work, I suppose.
Dialogue||I haven't had a real "day off" since I started academy, and I don't plan to take one anytime soon! My soldiers never get a day off, I could never take one myself.
Dialogue||Hello, XX. Since you moved in, I've had a good feeling. It's as though Sun Haven is embers, but the wind is kicking up flames.
Dialogue||So what's it like being in charge of Sun Haven?
Dialogue||What are your plans for Sun Haven?
Dialogue||It certainly comes with its challenges. At first, very few people accepted me as leader because I'm so young. I had to earn everyone's support gradually.
Dialogue||Now, everyone in town looks to me when there's a decision to make.
Dialogue||We're in an uphill battle to revive Sun Haven's economy. It's crucial that we bring more travelers and new shops into town. Every life in Sun Haven depends on my ability to make that happen.
Dialogue||Still, I'm not worried. Sun Haven has a bright future, and I will be there fanning the flames. Will you help me, XX?
Dialogue||To be fair, you are quite young.
Dialogue||I can't believe anyone doubted you.
Dialogue||I'm well aware, XX. If you have any doubts about me, just give it time. You'll come around.
Dialogue||Well, you did not see my first year as leader. I made my share of mistakes, then.
Dialogue||Suffice it to say I was incredibly lucky to have Elios guiding me along my path to becoming Archmage.
Dialogue||I'll do whatever I can to help our town.
Dialogue||I'm here for myself. I can't make any promises about the town.
Dialogue||I'm thankful, XX. There's something about you - I can't help but think Sun Haven is better for having you in it.
Dialogue||I suppose I don't blame you, but everyone has to contribute for a community to thrive. I hope you join us, XX.
Dialogue||You are fortunate to have earned my friendship.
Dialogue||Oh, XX. You haven't gotten your annual check-up. We should schedule one sometime.
Dialogue||You seem like you're always on top of everyone's wellbeing.
Dialogue||Why would I need an annual check-up?
Dialogue||You mean that as a good thing, right? I am a doctor after all. It's my job!
Dialogue||It's just good to stay on top of things, don't you agree? Especially health. You're always putting your body through the ringer, we should make sure you're in good condition.
Dialogue||It can be a little annoying, but I know it's for my own good.
Dialogue||Sun Haven is lucky to have a dedicated doctor like you.
Dialogue||Heheh. I know it might seem like a doctor nags at you, but trust me. We're in it to help you, it's what we do.
Dialogue||Hey, thanks. That... genuinely means quite a lot to me.
Dialogue||Nah, no thanks, doc.
Dialogue||Sure, pencil me in sometime soon.
Dialogue||I see. Well, I can't force you, though I think your decision is quite unwise.
Dialogue||Great. I'm actually pretty full up right now but it's good to know you take medical appointments seriously. I'll let you know when I have a spot available and we'll get you in.
Dialogue||Is it just me, or is there a little more magic in the air today than usual?
Dialogue||Hi XX. I'm going to play Dragons with Pod!
Dialogue||Your parents trust you to play without them watching?
Dialogue||How do you play?
Dialogue||I guess so. Anyway, Dad usually works on his sculptures outside so he can see me and Pod playing.
Dialogue||First you have to make a dragon - mine is an ice dragon so you can't choose that one. Then, you have a dragon battle!
Dialogue||You must be very responsible for your age.
Dialogue||Is your dad good at watching you?
Dialogue||I guess so. I don't know.
Dialogue||I'll choose... lightning dragon!
Dialogue||I'll choose... fire dragon!
Dialogue||Whoa, cool! Nobody's ever played lightning dragon before!
Dialogue||No fair, you just chose that because I chose ice. You play just like Pod!
Dialogue||... Hm? Oh, I must have missed what you said. I was thinking of an interlude in the song I'm writing.
Dialogue||We're lucky to have you here, XX.
Dialogue||I never noticed how defined your features are. I love looking at your face!
Dialogue||I bet I would look better in something made by you.
Dialogue||Every day I see your face is a good day, Lynn.
Dialogue||You mean like armor? I guess I could do that, but you'd have to put in an order with Solon and I would need your measurements.
Dialogue||Come on XX, you know I hate it when you make my face turn red!
Dialogue||You can measure me here and now!
Dialogue||Just kidding, I don't want to add to your workload.
Dialogue||You know, I'm actually really busy with other work, XX. Maybe another time.
Dialogue||Oh, XX you goose! You had me going there.
Dialogue||Uh oh, am I too gullible?
Dialogue||I'm surprised I still have that effect on you.
Dialogue||Even if you still get embarrassed, you've really come out of your shell since we met.
Dialogue||Honestly, I don't know if you ever WON'T have that effect on me. Just go easy on me, okay?
Dialogue||Thank you XX. I know I've come a long way, but I think you take a little credit for that, too.
Dialogue||Keep an eye out for local villains today. I mostly mean Topi and Pod, but you never know.
Dialogue||Hi again, XX. Do you want to chat? I've been trying to be more social lately.
Dialogue||If you want to be social, you should try the tavern.
Dialogue||So Lynn... do you have a partner back home?
Dialogue||I do go there, at the end of hard work days when I need to zone out. I like to find a corner of the tavern and listen to the chatter of voices for a while. It's oddly soothing!
Dialogue||As in, a romantic partner? Sorry, that caught me off guard.
Dialogue||Just pretend like I'm not blushing for a second!
Dialogue||The answer is no. Actually... I've never even been on a date.
Dialogue||Oh sheesh, why did I tell you that?? Pretend like you don't know that, okay?
Dialogue||I'm surprised you can zone out in the tavern with all that noise.
Dialogue||I'm surprised you don't join in the conversation.
Dialogue||Small talk is difficult for me, but a room full of voices has a good feeling to it. I'll even close my eyes to listen... and then it doesn't feel like I'm alone at my table.
Dialogue||If you lived in the Great City, I bet you'd get lots of dates.
Dialogue||I knew it.
Dialogue||Oh, shush or my face will get all red!!
Dialogue||Oh? Is it that... unsurprising? I guess I shouldn't be surprised, either.
Dialogue||As much as I hope this town gets its revival, I worry about competing stores opening their doors.
Dialogue||What? Are you worried the commoners will see you with me? Hah, let them look!
Dialogue||Elizabeth made a painting of me the other day. She's so adorable, and Jun loaned her some of his paints! I really need to thank him, but I'm just not sure how...
Dialogue||Why don't you know how to thank Jun?
Dialogue||Elizabeth must really love you to paint a picture of you.
Dialogue||I mean, I'm really grateful he let Elizabeth use his paints. It was very kind of him, but... how do I thank him the right way?
Dialogue||What if I try to get him a thank you gift and he doesn't like it? Oh, that'd be so awkward!
Dialogue||Shucks! Both my sisters love me! And I love them, too. Still, though, when I saw Elizabeth's little painting of me, I almost cried a little.
Dialogue||Ah, I can't believe I just told you that!
Dialogue||Just let him know what it means to you, that'd be enough.
Dialogue||If you're that worried, then don't do anything.
Dialogue||You think so, XX? Yeah, I guess you're right. Jun is a really peaceful guy, he wouldn't really be expecting a gift as a thank you. Hm, maybe a fresh batch of rolls though?
Dialogue||That seems like a fair gift in exchange for paint, I think.
Dialogue||That's even worse! I'm going to worry about this all night, now! All this over a painting, yeesh!
Dialogue||Don't be embarassed, Liam.
Dialogue||Everyone knows you love your sisters, it's no big deal.
Dialogue||Easier said than done! My cheeks aren't red, are they? Now I'm worried about that! And I'm still not sure just how to thank Jun!
Dialogue||I know everyone knows, but it's still a little embarrassing to cry at a painting, isn't it? My cheeks aren't red, are they? Now I'm worried about that! And I'm still not sure just how to thank Jun!
Dialogue||I only take my wedding ring off when I'm working - trust me, it's for the best.
Dialogue||I hope your day finds a good end, XX!
Dialogue||I've been thinking of romance a lot these past days. It's strange to me, how do you think people do it?
Dialogue||What's got you thinking about romance?
Dialogue||Haven't you ever wanted to fall in love?
Dialogue||I dunno. Just strange, I wonder how people seem so easily cut out for it.
Dialogue||Meeting, getting married, the home life. All that stuff.
Dialogue||I've never pictured myself doing it, at least. There's been times where I thought maybe I was feeling that way, but they never worked out.
Dialogue||If I think about the future, it's mostly just about my music.
Dialogue||I guess it just comes more naturally to some people.
Dialogue||Lots of people grow up with the expectation of falling in love and getting married.
Dialogue||Yeah. Still so strange, though. I wonder if it'll happen to me, or how I'd even make it happen. It's all so ethereal, I guess.
Dialogue||Suppose that's true. I never thought much about it, even as a kid, so I guess as I grew up it was still never something I thought about.
Dialogue||Most people seem like it's such a no-brainer to them.
Dialogue||Don't push yourself to conform to any standards that aren't your own.
Dialogue||You probably just never looked hard enough to find love.
Dialogue||Heh, thanks. I told myself something like that a long time ago, but it's good to hear it from someone else.
Dialogue||Well... you aren't wrong. I probably didn't, but you make it sound like that's inherently wrong, XX.
Dialogue||How have you been holding on, XX? I've been busier than ever!
Dialogue||What's got you so busy?
Dialogue||If you could take a vacation, where would you go?
Dialogue||Sun Haven has really picked up a lot of steam lately. There's more to take care of as Archmage! I don't mind the extra work, but it's more than I'm accustomed to.
Dialogue||I don't have any time to even think about taking a vacation, but... if I could choose anywhere...
Dialogue||Well, it's said that there are many ancient ruins in the Northern Region. Those would be pretty interesting to see.
Dialogue||And I could test my fire power out against the cold harshness of the north!
Dialogue||If anyone can do it, it's you!
Dialogue||You signed up for this when you became Archmage.
Dialogue||Well, that's certainly a good point. It doesn't matter how much I have to do, I'll go above and beyond for everyone in Sun Haven.
Dialogue||I am very aware of that, XX. I'm not sure why you felt a need to remind me.
Dialogue||I didn't expect such an adventurous answer.
Dialogue||That doesn't sound like a very relaxing vacation!
Dialogue||Serving Sun Haven is my life's work, but if I ever have the chance, it would be fun to adventure in a new land and experience new things. Maybe one day.
Dialogue||XX! I'm glad you're here, I could use a friendly face. I've been pretty stressed out...
Dialogue||Maybe a walk on the beach would relax you.
Dialogue||Why don't we meet up together? Sounds like we could both use it.
Dialogue||I've only been down there once. Maybe I should spend more time in nature. What do you think?
Dialogue||Oh! Wow, just... the two of us? That sounds nice! Let's do it.
Dialogue||Nature helps to clear your head, sometimes.
Dialogue||Nature won't help with your stress. Maybe you should talk to Jun.
Dialogue||Well, it's certainly a better solution than no solution at all. Thanks XX, I'll give it a shot.
Dialogue||Oh yeah, he's the counselor right? I don't know if I could do that, though. Just open up to a complete stranger... but maybe it wouldn't be so bad.
Dialogue||Tomorrow, then?
Dialogue||On second thought, we better not.
Dialogue||Yeah! I think I already know where we should go. Just meet me in front of my house tomorrow at 10:00 am!
Dialogue||Now that you mention it, I suppose you're right.
Dialogue||Feel free to sleep in my house whenever you want, XX!
Dialogue||One time I found a gold coin at the beach!
Dialogue||When Solon works hard, he works <i>really</i> hard! He was smacking a breastplate with such force the other day that he cracked the anvil nearly in half!
Dialogue||Your ears must be ringing at the end of the day.
Dialogue||Does it ever make you want to find a new place to work?
Dialogue||It's true! No one seems to think how loud working in a smithery must be! Thankfully Solon normally has enough wares that he only worries about selling the stock.
Dialogue||But whenever he gets on an anvil... my head rings for days!
Dialogue||Of course not! I find Solon incredibly inspiring, actually. To strike metal so hard you break your anvil! It's not just his raw strength that does that, you know.
Dialogue||Solon is working, all day every day, honing his mastery. If I could even be a tenth the blacksmith Solon is, I'd be so proud of myself.
Dialogue||You should try some kind of ear plugs.
Dialogue||My head hurts just thinking about it.
Dialogue||Hmm. To plug up my ears? That's maybe not a bad idea, XX. I'll have to look into that sometime!
Dialogue||Well, I hope next time you're exhausted after a hard day work that you count your lucky stars that you don't have to put up with Solon's hammering!
Dialogue||You're going to surpass Solon in no time!
Dialogue||A student could never surpass a master.
Dialogue||No matter what, it's what I want to do! I don't care how many hammer smacks I have to listen to!
Dialogue||Sorry XX, but I've never heard anything so ridiculous.
Dialogue||When I shut my eyes, you're the first thing I see. Do you see me too?
Dialogue||Mama lies down a lot, but she always plays games with me!
Dialogue||The farmer and the soldier... it almost sounds like the start to a fairytale.
Dialogue||"Married" is such an adult word. It's weird to think that it applies to me... I barely feel like an adult!
Dialogue||I was hoping my kid would look like me, but Topi inherited his father's hair...
Dialogue||Your magic seems a lot stronger now, XX. I'm really glad Elios gave you his blessing.
Dialogue||Have you ever visited Elios on Dragon's Meet?
Dialogue||You never got his blessing?
Dialogue||Yes, I visited Elios. It was a true honor being in the presence of such strong magic... though I didn't much like the hike up the mountain.
Dialogue||I'm glad I did it, but I'm also glad that I don't have to do it again!
Dialogue||No, I'm afraid not. Otherwise, I would be able to channel magic through my body like you and Lucia. But I think I get by just fine with my witchcraft.
Dialogue||I'm surprised that hiking is a challenge for someone like you.
Dialogue||The journey to Dragon's Meet is tough. I guess that means you're tougher!
Dialogue||Hiking is no problem, but being escorted through monsters and blazing heat is entirely different. Give me some credit, XX!
Dialogue||Aw, thanks! I had blisters on my heels for a week, haha.
Dialogue||Hard as it was, it was well worth getting a blessing from the Sun Dragon. Honestly, I don't think I've felt that good before or since.
Dialogue||It's amazing that you have such a deep connection with magic, then.
Dialogue||You have a truly unique relationship with magic.
Dialogue||Magic is everywhere, XX. Everyone has a connection to it, but some people don't pay attention. I just pay attention, that's all.
Dialogue||XX, good to see you! Do you need any help managing your finances? I have some great tips!
Dialogue||Since you know so much, why not just buy a shop in town?
Dialogue||I know you've traveled a lot for work. How many cities have you lived in?
Dialogue||My mobility is a key part of my success. To put it simply, I find my way out when the gold stops coming in. That's how I've survived this long.
Dialogue||It's a lot harder to leave if my shop isn't on wheels!
Dialogue||Oh jeez... I've visited too many to count but I only actually lived in about ten of them. A couple here in the Western Region, five in the Eastern Region, and three in the north.
Dialogue||Maybe if you put your effort into a store, customers would travel to you.
Dialogue||You've got some good survival instincts!
Dialogue||I put plenty of effort into my shop already, XX. Besides, a farmer is the last person I would take business advice from.
Dialogue||Of course I do! Whoops, I mean... thanks! Survival was the first thing I learned. The second was business.
Dialogue||You've never lived in the south?
Dialogue||You spent a lot of time in the east, huh?
Dialogue||One day I will, but only after I'm done with my merchant cart. Getting it to the islands in the south is a real pain - it doesn't float and transportation costs more than it's worth.
Dialogue||Easterners treated me very kindly. Plus, they have very loose pockets, if you know what I mean! They can be a little traditional for my taste, but everyone is welcoming no matter where you go.
Dialogue||Not to mention the food. The servings they give are huge!
Dialogue||From outsider to one of Withergate's top personalities. Well done, XX.
Dialogue||There's my farmer!
Dialogue||Do you think I'm "yours?"
Dialogue||So what are the rules for dating civilians, anyway?
Dialogue||Oh, of course not! I wouldn't think that. I just meant - well, I'm always happy when I can see you.
Dialogue||Well, the rules of decorum don't explicitly say anything against it... I don't think we have anything to worry about, XX.
Dialogue||Don't worry, Nathaniel - I'm kidding!
Dialogue||It's okay Nathaniel, I can be yours.
Dialogue||Oh man, you had me going there. The last thing I want to do is make you upset.
Dialogue||That's too bad - I kind of like breaking the rules.
Dialogue||That's good, I don't want to get you in any trouble.
Dialogue||Maybe you do, but I still have a career to protect.
Dialogue||Any trouble that comes my way is only on me, XX. Don't worry. Everything will work out just fine, I know it!
Dialogue||Good day, citizen! Heh, don't worry XX, I haven't forgotten your name.
Dialogue||I've been here long enough to know everyone's name by heart.
Dialogue||You're in a good mood.
Dialogue||How long have you been here, anyway?
Dialogue||I try to keep spirits up when I'm on duty. I find it calms the civilians. Besides, it's refreshing to wear a smile sometimes instead of my army face.
Dialogue||I shipped here about... five years ago now?
Dialogue||Wow, I never counted the years before. Time really flies by. But I guess that's part of what it means to dedicate your service to a cause.
Dialogue||Don't you worry that people won't take you seriously?
Dialogue||Keeping people calm in tense times is very thoughtful.
Dialogue||Not at all. At least, I didn't before you said that...
Dialogue||Why thank you, XX! The soldier's motto is "Duty through service," but that doesn't always have to mean combat.
Dialogue||That's a long time.
Dialogue||I'm surprised you can stay positive after all that time.
Dialogue||Duty through service, right? Luckily, Sun Haven is a great city. Even if I have to give five more years, I'm glad it's here.
Dialogue||Hi neighbor. Got something on your mind?
Dialogue||Would you say Sun Haven is a good place to raise a family?
Dialogue||So you're an artist?
Dialogue||Tonya and I have lived here our whole lives. Plus, we had Topi here. That's three generations of families, and we're all happy as clams!
Dialogue||Oh sure, I've been an artist since I was, well, close to your age. I only started sculpting about a year ago, so I'm still perfecting my craft.
Dialogue||You don't have any complaints about this town?
Dialogue||I guess we could use an art supplies store. I have to forage berries to make my own paint. It gets real messy...
Dialogue||A year isn't enough time?
Dialogue||No matter how long it takes, progress is progress.
Dialogue||I didn't realize I was speaking with such a critic. Artistic expression has no timeline.
Dialogue||That's what I say! Well, not exactly in those words. Actually, what I say is quite different. But I like what you said, too!
Dialogue||You know, we should work together. With your fresh ingredients, I could make some delicious treats!
Dialogue||Don't they say not to mix business with your personal life?
Dialogue||But your food is already so fresh!
Dialogue||Who says that? Is that a real thing? I haven't heard it before, but I'm often oblivious to these things.
Dialogue||Well yeah, but not as fresh as your crops! I'm really curious to know if there's a difference in the taste.
Dialogue||It's just a saying.
Dialogue||It's true, you know.
Dialogue||If I'm not supposed to mix business with my personal life, then I was doomed from the start. How caould anyone have a family business like that?
Dialogue||Okay, it sounds fun!
Dialogue||I don't think it's a good idea for us to work together.
Dialogue||Yeah? Great! I can't wait to see what we make together, XX!
Dialogue||Oh... Okay then, I understand. Forget I mentioned it.
Dialogue||Fine art is a satisfying form of expression, but farming seems pretty creative too.
Dialogue||How is farming creative?
Dialogue||What other kinds of art do you do?
Dialogue||You're over there growing living things all day. If you ask me, making a living thing is as creative as it gets!
Dialogue||I've dabbled here and there over the years. I've done my share of painting, and still do. I also used to whittle, but I stopped because I kept cutting my fingers.
Dialogue||That's true, it's very rewarding.
Dialogue||I don't think of it like that.
Dialogue||I know how you feel. My art is fulfilling too, but it's nothing compared to having Topi. He's my best work yet!
Dialogue||Ah, maybe you're not much of an artist then.
Dialogue||What's your favorite art form?
Dialogue||How do you choose which art form to practice?
Dialogue||I haven't been sculpting that long, but I'm completely obsessed with it. I'm probably just in the honeymoon phase, though. I'm sure I'll discover something new in a couple months.
Dialogue||When something new finds me, it I become completely obsessed with it. I know I'm just in the honeymoon phase with sculpting right now.  I'll probably discover something new in a couple months.
Dialogue||Lucia is both direct and kind. She's truly a born leader.
Dialogue||This talk about Withergate has me on edge. Am I the only one?
Dialogue||Look around you. Everything the darkness touches will be mine someday.
Dialogue||It's surprising there aren't more married couples in Sun Haven. Hey, maybe we'll start a trend?
Dialogue||I'm something of a queen among my fellow merchants, you know. Yep, you're dating royalty!
Dialogue||You smell wonderful today, XX. Oh - you're not wearing any perfume?
Dialogue||Hey XX, having fun yet? There's always something to do here!
Dialogue||I spend a lot of time just exploring the town. When I'm not working, of course.
Dialogue||Do you have any hobbies just for fun?
Dialogue||Do you have a favorite spot around town?
Dialogue||I like cooking big meals for myself, if you count that. I usually make too much, though. Say, I should give you some leftovers the next time I cook.
Dialogue||I just love the windmills on the way to the beach. You've seen them by now, right?
Dialogue||Try this, lie in the grass and watch the windmills spin against the sky. Without fail, it always takes my mind away. The way they spin in unison is mesmerizing. I wonder, how do they do that?
Dialogue||You shouldn't waste food like that.
Dialogue||That sounds great! I bet you're a fantastic cook.
Dialogue||Relax XX, I don't waste food. I share with my pet mouse, Charlie. Let's not make assumptions about each other, okay?
Dialogue||Hey, don't take my word for it. Bring me some potatoes and I'll make you a great egg hash!
Dialogue||I'll have to try it!
Dialogue||Spinning things make me dizzy...
Dialogue||Just be careful not to get sunburned. I fell asleep out there once and came back looking like Peter's pet crab.
Dialogue||In that case, there's always the beach - plenty of natural beauty there, too. That's the thing about Sun Haven, you find beauty no matter where you look.
Dialogue||I'm just trying to make the best life for myself here, same as anyone.
Dialogue||XX, my muse, my love. My future. Am I the only one having trouble believing that this is reality?
Dialogue||What makes our marriage so unbelievable?
Dialogue||I look forward to the songs you'll compose throughout our lives together.
Dialogue||It's impossible for me to imagine perfection. If I do something, then inherently it will have flaws. That's just how I've always been, and how I've done my music.
Dialogue||But... I can't seem to find anything imperfect about us. It's new to me, but I think I can adjust.
Dialogue||In the past, something like that might have made me feel as if I were put under pressure. But now, I feel excited. Inspired. This is the best I've ever felt in my life, maybe.
Dialogue||I look forward to the songs I will compose during our marriage, too.
Dialogue||Well believe it or not, we're perfect together!
Dialogue||I thought you'd feel better about our marriage.
Dialogue||I think so too, XX. I've committed my everything to you, and I know I won't ever regret it.
Dialogue||I didn't mean it like that, XX. I'm sorry if I upset you.
Dialogue||It's nice to finally see you feeling so inspired.
Dialogue||It's about time you got your inspiration back so strong.
Dialogue||Heh, is that why you married me? To see me inspired? I'm joking, of course.
Dialogue||We could spend more time together if we weren't both so busy. Maybe I'll take some time off... maybe.
Dialogue||Another quiet day.
Dialogue||Do I smell funny? A potion blew up on me this morning. Witchcraft can be a messy business...
Dialogue||So what got you into witchcraft, anyway?
Dialogue||Is there anything you hope to accomplish as a witch?
Dialogue||This might sound bad, but I started looking at spells when I was a kid so I could play tricks on my littermates. I managed to keep it secret for months!
Dialogue||All I want from my craft is to make life comfortable for myself and my loved ones. Witchcraft makes that a whole lot easier.
Dialogue||You figured out witchcraft as a child?
Dialogue||You were so mischievous!
Dialogue||Yep, I got a bit of a head start. It was definitely more power than a kid should have, that's for sure.
Dialogue||It's certainly paid off now - my whole living is based off my magic!
Dialogue||I was! Thankfully I grew out of misusing my magic.
Dialogue||To be honest, I started a lot of fights. It's a good thing my mother caught on.
Dialogue||Why practice magic if you don't have any big goals?
Dialogue||All that matters is that you're happy doing it.
Dialogue||You should keep in mind that I've been practicing since I was just a kid. I know what I'm doing, and I really don't need any criticism from you, XX.
Dialogue||I think so, too. Sometimes just keeping yourself happy is enough.
Dialogue||Hey, maybe I could show you some spellcraft sometime!
Dialogue||Using a rolling pin all day is a surprisingly tough exercise. I'm still waiting for the muscles to come in...
Dialogue||I decided a long time ago to give my life in service to Sun Haven.
Dialogue||How've you been, XX? Good company is always welcome by me.
Dialogue||Is there anyone here you'd consider bad company?
Dialogue||Do you ever worry about Sun Haven's future?
Dialogue||Not in the slightest! Part of why I love Sun Haven is because I consider everyone here to be a friend of mine.
Dialogue||You mean with all the rumors that have been going around about that monster city? It's a little unnerving, so I try not to think about it too much. Sun Haven seems to be doing pretty well, anyway!
Dialogue||What about Calvin?
Dialogue||What about Solon?
Dialogue||Calvin is a riot! Have you spoken to him? He acts so grumpy all the time - it's hilarious!
Dialogue||Of course I get along with Solon - he's an artist like me! It's impossible not to respect the level of mastery he's reached in blacksmithing.
Dialogue||It sounds like you're avoiding the problem.
Dialogue||I agree, Sun Haven is going to be just fine.
Dialogue||Heh, yeah maybe I am. I have to keep a brave face sometimes for Topi. I figure there's no point in worrying unless Nathaniel or Lucia tells us to.
Dialogue||Even if you're wrong, it's just nice to hear someone else say that!
Dialogue||Ever since we got together, I've been gaining weight. It's good - I was a little skinny before.
Dialogue||I thought you looked a little healthier.
Dialogue||Since we're together, do I get free medical care?
Dialogue||Oh yeah? Well feel free to mention it next time! I'm not opposed to flattery, you know. Who doesn't enjoy a nice compliment?
Dialogue||I still have to make a living, you know. Unless you want to take over paying my bills?
Dialogue||All right then - nobody wears a white cloak like you do!
Dialogue||I don't want your head getting too big.
Dialogue||Despite the fact that nobody in Sun Haven wears a white cloak other than me, I'll take the compliment. Haha, thank you XX!
Dialogue||Is this a legitimate concern of yours? I'm a grown man, XX. I know how to handle my own ego.
Dialogue||You're on your own there, Wornhardt.
Dialogue||I'll always support you, even paying your bills if I have to.
Dialogue||Haha, I think I'll manage! A doctor's paycheck is pretty good, you know.
Dialogue||Thank goodness it won't come to that. A doctor's paycheck is pretty good, you know.
Dialogue||Science is like a kind of magic, too. At least, it looks like magic to anyone who doesn't understand it.
Dialogue||I wish I could stay to chat with you, really. Unfortunately, I must be going.
Dialogue||Ah, my little ray of darkness. It's good to see you.
Dialogue||Hello again. XX, isn't it?
Dialogue||You mentioned your work before. What kind of work do you do?
Dialogue||I'm a composer, so I make music. Making music is all I've ever done, and all I really care to do.
Dialogue||I'm hardly ever not working. But when I do take a break, I'll stop in the tavern to have a meal or go for a walk. That's maybe once a day.
Dialogue||I'd love to hear your music, sometime.
Dialogue||Is that how you got so rich?
Dialogue||... Really? Funny, people don't usually show interest in my work.
Dialogue||Typical - all anyone ever cares about is my money.
Dialogue||You only get out once a day?
Dialogue||What do you like to eat?
Dialogue||We can't all be farmers, XX.
Dialogue||I prefer a good soup. I try to get meat and vegetables in one sitting in case I forget to eat again that day.
Dialogue||How are you, XX? You're looking really good!
Dialogue||You seem to be doing well these days, too.
Dialogue||You've gained some muscle yourself.
Dialogue||You know, maybe it does feel like the days are getting easier. I don't even know what changed, to be honest.
Dialogue||Really? I don't know why that would be... I guess I've been lifting more bags of flour now that business is starting to pick up a bit.
Dialogue||I know what changed - you!
Dialogue||It must be because of Jun's work.
Dialogue||I guess so, huh? Or, you know, it could even be because of a new relationship... Can you tell I'm talking about you? Because I am!
Dialogue||I get what you mean, but I'd like a little credit too.
Dialogue||I'll add bags of flour to my exercise routine.
Dialogue||I'm glad to hear business is good!
Dialogue||Yeah right, like you need any help! Between the farming and adventuring, I'd say your routine works just fine already.
Dialogue||Oh right, I never mentioned - I had my best week yet! Peter asked for thirty loaves of bread. I didn't want to ask why and jinx it, but... I mean, why??
Dialogue||Sun Haven's really starting to feel like home to me now.
Dialogue||Hi again. Sorry, it's XX, right? It's been a while since somebody new moved in.
Dialogue||No offense Liam, but you look like you need a nap.
Dialogue||What do you do for a living, Liam?
Dialogue||That's only because I do... Sorry, I don't mean to complain. I'm just burning the candle at both ends these days.
Dialogue||I run the bakery. I mean, I'm a baker. I also take care of my sisters. Usually, I'm doing both at the same time.
Dialogue||You should take better care of yourself.
Dialogue||If it makes you feel better, you smell fantastic.
Dialogue||I'm aware, thanks.
Dialogue||Oh? Must be the gingerbread. Hey, that's an upside to baking that I never thought about. Thanks!
Dialogue||Do your sisters help in the bakery?
Dialogue||How old are your sisters?
Dialogue||Emma and Elizabeth, they're just kids. They tried helping me bake once and it went... not too good.
Dialogue||Calvin returned a cake with glitter in it. I couldn't stop giggling because he had sparkles in his teeth. He was pretty mad...
Dialogue||How is everything with your work, my love?
Dialogue||Hi, farmer! Remember me? I'm Elizabeth!
Dialogue||You remember me?
Dialogue||Are you Liam's new best friend now?
Dialogue||Funny, funny, like how Liam does sock puppets!
Dialogue||That's right, and he's told me a lot about you.
Dialogue||We're not best friends yet.
Dialogue||Liam talked to you about me?? Hehehe!
Dialogue||Oh. Hm... you should be best friends, instead.
Dialogue||Is he good at making sock puppets?
Dialogue||Does he do funny voices too?
Dialogue||The puppets are funny. They bonk each other on the head - bonk!
Dialogue||Yeah, funny voices too! I laugh a lot when he does it, hehe.
Dialogue||Nya nya nyaaaa...
Dialogue||Where are you going, nya? Can I come too? Oh wait, I forgot I'm so so busy!
Dialogue||I never saw myself as a farmer's wife... It's not so bad!
Dialogue||Catherine is a great neighbor, and it's really nice living so close to where I work. You're all the way out there on your farm, don't you ever get lonely?
Dialogue||I tend to keep pretty busy.
Dialogue||It's hard to get lonely with such good friends, though.
Dialogue||That is very true. You're always coming and going, it seems. I don't know where you find the energy!
Dialogue||That's a very sweet thing of you to say. You must have met most of the people around town by now. I'm still a little shy, even after all this time.
Dialogue||I see you working hard all the time, too.
Dialogue||Hey, I'm Blessed and you're not.
Dialogue||Do you really notice? Solon is always telling me to slow down, but my mother was a real whip cracker! I don't know how to slow down, sometimes!
Dialogue||Maybe I'm not Blessed like you, but you seem like you're being a little bit rude about it...
Dialogue||You're doing fine, Lynn. Everyone is glad to have you.
Dialogue||Come out of your shell a bit sometime.
Dialogue||You're right, XX. I should come out of my shell a little more often and get around town! Thanks for giving me a confidence booster.
Dialogue||Yeah, I should try getting out and seeing more things Sun Haven has to offer. Kitty keeps asking me to visit her pet shop!
Dialogue||There are times when I look over Sun Haven and remember that I'm in charge. As a young girl, I never would have imagined it.
Dialogue||So you were born in Sun Haven?
Dialogue||What do you think you would be doing if you weren't Sun Haven's Archmage?
Dialogue||Yes, I'm proudly native to Sun Haven! I was raised here by my grandparents.
Dialogue||I would not have gained control over my magic as a child without Grandfather. Now I think about him whenever I cast a spell. In that way, I keep his memory alive.
Dialogue||Hm... I imagine I would go into teaching, like Jun. I could teach kids how to control magic like my grandfather did for me.
Dialogue||Oh, then my pupils would call me master! Little firebugs, how adorable!
Dialogue||Your grandfather left a good legacy behind.
Dialogue||Do you ever think that you're holding onto the past too much?
Dialogue||That's sweet, XX. Thank you for listening. It may be childish, but I like to remember him out loud in stories.
Dialogue||Either you're completely out of touch with your emotions or you've never lost anyone important. For your sake, I hope it's the latter.
Dialogue||You'd be an excellent teacher.
Dialogue||Maybe you can do that when you're finished as Archmage.
Dialogue||Thank you XX, I think so too. Oh, and then I could leave stamps on students' homework! Stamps with sayings such as, "YOU'RE ON FIRE!" and "HOT STUFF!"
Dialogue||All right then, it's settled. I would be a teacher - if only for the fun stamps.
Dialogue||In truth, I've no idea when that will be.
Dialogue||I'm quite protective over this town, so I intend to retain my position until I find a replacement about whom I'm absolutely certain.
Dialogue||I guess this means I shouldn't play on the farm anymore.
Dialogue||When's the last time you climbed a nice, tall tree, XX? We should go climbing together sometime, nya!
Dialogue||I don't really climb any trees.
Dialogue||Where do you usually climb trees?
Dialogue||Nya?! Well you should start! It's a great pastime!
Dialogue||Any tree is a good tree to climb, nya. Out in the forest there's always big, soft, lazy Snaccoons sleeping under the trees!
Dialogue||They're just sooo big and cute, I wish I could keep one as a pet, like my kitties!
Dialogue||What if I fall?
Dialogue||You're probably a lot better at it than me.
Dialogue||You just land on your feet, silly! Wait, you're good at that, right? Kitty is! I've never landed anywhere else, nya!
Dialogue||Heheh, I bet you aren't wrong! I've climbed trees my whole life, and I'm very good at it, nya!
Dialogue||A Snaccoon would be a cute pet, but hard to feed!
Dialogue||Don't be crazy, you couldn't keep a Snaccoon as a pet!
Dialogue||That's truuueee, XX! But they sleep a lot, so it gives Kitty plenty of time to find them some food!
Dialogue||You think too small, XX! You gotta dream like Kitty: big!
Dialogue||Hello XX, you've got a funny funny look on your face. Did you sleep okay?
Dialogue||I had a lot of fun on our first date...
Dialogue||Kitty, what do you like most about your work?
Dialogue||Me too, XX! And I can't wait for the next one!
Dialogue||Oh, sooo many things. The pet store looks so cute on the outside. But even most of all is the adorable animals! I always get along with animals so it's easy and fun for me, nya.
Dialogue||Would you like to go out again tomorrow?
Dialogue||I think we should just be friends, Kitty.
Dialogue||AH! Yes, I'd love to! Oh so fun, nya. You should come to my house tomorrow at 5:00 pm!
Dialogue||Oh, really? I thought different, but okay... I'd rather be friends than nothing, nyaa.
Dialogue||Of course you get along with animals.
Dialogue||You're lucky to have a job you love.
Dialogue||What do you mean, nyan?? That's very very rude, XX! You need to treat Kitty nicer.
Dialogue||I agree, teehee! It's much more fun. Sometimes I see Emmett in the store and he doesn't look so happy... but I can tell you like your farm, nya!
Dialogue||You're looking nice, XX. I like keeping company with orderly people.
Dialogue||I feel like we're getting to be pretty good friends.
Dialogue||Do you ever wish you had more close friends?
Dialogue||Well... sure. I suppose I'd call us friends at this point. I mean, if you think so too.
Dialogue||No, never. People are distracting.
Dialogue||Friends and family make a lot of people happy, but it's just different for me. Nobody seems to understand that.
Dialogue||That doesn't sound very friendly.
Dialogue||I'm glad to hear you say that, Claude!
Dialogue||That's about as friendly as I get, XX. You can take it or leave it.
Dialogue||Thanks for not teasing me about it.
Dialogue||Everyone needs somebody in their life.
Dialogue||Everyone finds happiness in their own way.
Dialogue||Apparently, you're one of those people who don't get it.
Dialogue||That's exactly right. It looks like you're both thoughtful and fashionable.
Dialogue||Oh, did you see that? The wind just blew in a little circle... what could it mean?
Dialogue||Sorry, I'm quite busy.
Dialogue||Hey there, XX. I hope you're doing well these days.
Dialogue||You always smell like fresh soil. I love it!
Dialogue||... Hm? Oh - pardon me, XX. I was in another world, thinking about music.
Dialogue||You still haven't told me much about your music.
Dialogue||Do you ever share your music?
Dialogue||I don't know what to tell you. I make it, it comes out wrong, I make it again.
Dialogue||I don't share my music with anybody.
Dialogue||Nothing great ever happened on the first try.
Dialogue||Maybe you should just move on to another project.
Dialogue||There's truth to that, even if it's kind of an annoying truth. I'll try to remember that, XX.
Dialogue||Thanks XX, but I don't need you to tell me how to give up. I already know how to do that.
Dialogue||Wouldn't it be helpful to have other people listen to it?
Dialogue||If you ever want an outside opinion on your work, I'm happy to help.
Dialogue||It's about meeting my own standards, XX. What do I care what other people think?
Dialogue||I guess you're probably my first choice at this point. I don't want to get your hopes up, though.
Dialogue||Solon is having me craft a set of very intricate gauntlets! It's precise work so I'm trying really hard not to mess it up.
Dialogue||"Gauntlets," those are a suit of armor's gloves, right?
Dialogue||Why did Solon give you such a hard task?
Dialogue||That's right. They go on the hands, so there's all the little finger pieces I have to do, and the palm measurements have to be super accurate.
Dialogue||It's making me anxious just thinking about it, but I want to do my best.
Dialogue||Solon says he sees a lot of potential in me, and that makes me really happy. But I also think he's testing me, and what if I fail?! Oh, XX, I can barely stand to think about it!
Dialogue||I'm sure you're more than capable.
Dialogue||Just do your best. If you mess up, you mess up.
Dialogue||Thanks for the vote of confidence, XX. I'm really scared that Solon won't like what I make, but I still really want to meet his expectations.
Dialogue||In a way, that leaves me feeling... excited.
Dialogue||I like your way of looking at it, XX. I'm really scared that Solon won't like what I make, but I still really want to meet his expectations.
Dialogue||You're going to fail if you don't relax.
Dialogue||Be honest with Solon and tell him you're having trouble.
Dialogue||I know! That's just making it impossible for me to calm down! I should just tell Solon I'm not ready for this. He'll be dissappointed, probably...
Dialogue||D-do you really think I should do that? He is my teacher, after all. Maybe he'll understand, or even help me out. Hmm, it's a little scary, but I think you're right, XX!
Dialogue||Or, at least, I hope you're right...
Dialogue||Hi XX. You look far off... Something on your mind?
Dialogue||Topi and Pod have me thinking. What's your favorite childhood memory?
Dialogue||Speaking of far off... If you could travel anywhere, where would it be?
Dialogue||I don't really have an answer. Look, I had a rough childhood. I didn't have birthday parties or lollipops whenever I scraped my elbows. And in case my tone isn't clear, I don't like getting into it.
Dialogue||That's easy, the Southern Region. I've always wanted to live in a tropical paradise, and the water there is warm enough to swim in every day. I can already see my cabana on the beach!
Dialogue||I'm sure there was someone who could have helped you.
Dialogue||If you ever do want to talk, you can talk to me.
Dialogue||How can you say that when you don't even know what happened? Don't try to help people who don't ask for it, XX.
Dialogue||Thanks for the offer, I guess. Jun has tried to squeeze it out of me before but he's so... tender. He means well, but it annoys me. I appreciate what you said though, XX. I'll keep it in mind.
Dialogue||Do you think you would continue working as a merchant?
Dialogue||Why do you want to live on the islands?
Dialogue||Of course! My plan is to have a partner in the north send me items that I can label as "exotic" in the south. Then I could open a shop that's small but with high-value goods.
Dialogue||Low work, high payoff. That's the life!
Dialogue||The Southern islanders know how to live! They work the days and celebrate the nights. Plus, the islands get a lot of tourists.
Dialogue||It's the perfect work-life balance - work off the tourists and live with the natives.
Dialogue||My family mailed me a package of my mother's homemade honeycakes. I was going to share them with everyone, but I... kinda ate the entire box. They were just so good!
Dialogue||You ate an entire box of cakes?!
Dialogue||So your mom is a baker, huh? I thought she was a blacksmith.
Dialogue||It isn't like I meant to!! It just made me realize how much I miss my family back home. Even if Liam is twice the baker my mom could ever be, it's like I could taste the love.
Dialogue||Well, my mother bakes. She isn't really a 'baker' like Liam. I have a cousin who is a pretty good baker, but he ended up moving away up to a bigger village.
Dialogue||When I'm a master smith, I always wanted to travel up there and pop in on him as a surprise! He'd never expect quiet little Lynn to do something like that!
Dialogue||Are you thinking about moving back home?
Dialogue||Everything tastes better when mom makes it.
Dialogue||No, I miss it sometimes, but I'm focused on Sun Haven for the time being.
Dialogue||Maybe there'll come a day when I move back home, but it won't be until after I become a master smith!
Dialogue||Right? Now I'm super regretting that I ate them all myself!! I swear, next time she sends me something, you're going to be the first to try it! Well, after me, at least!
Dialogue||I'm sure he wouldn't want to be bothered like that.
Dialogue||The look on his face is going to be priceless!
Dialogue||We were actually really close growing up. I know he'd be thrilled to see me, so you probably don't know what you're talking about!
Dialogue||Tell me about it! I don't even think he knows I left the village, even. Busting into his bakery and flexing my master blacksmith skills on him? I bet he'd be likely to fall faint!
Dialogue||You're less an outsider every day, XX.
Dialogue||After all this time together, I only feel closer than ever with you, XX. I don't know how I could get any happier.
Dialogue||Have you ever been this close with someone before?
Dialogue||Jun, more and more I feel like we were meant for each other.
Dialogue||I'm curious... What if I had been? How would that make you feel?
Dialogue||I strongly believe in fate and I'm sure that my fate is with you. XX, let's allow our destinies play out.
Dialogue||That might be a disappointment, but nothing I couldn't move past.
Dialogue||I wouldn't mind - you're your own person.
Dialogue||Thank you for your honesty. Don't worry XX, I've only had passing fancies in my time. I've never connected with anyone like you before.
Dialogue||A very healthy mindset. XX, I have a suspicion you would make a good counselor yourself!
Dialogue||To answer your question, I've only had passing fancies in my time. I've never connected with anyone like you before.
Dialogue||I don't believe in fate at all.
Dialogue||Fate definitely brought us together!
Dialogue||Well, that's not very romantic...
Dialogue||And nothing in this world will break us apart, XX. Nothing.
Dialogue||I've already tasked Xyla with designing your crown. It will be extravagant without match, and all the more once it's on your head.
Dialogue||Lately a big, mean dog has been chasing my kittens, nyan!
Dialogue||Are your kittens okay?
Dialogue||You must really hate this dog.
Dialogue||They're all safe and sound right now, nya! The first time that dog came by, though, it was terrible! Kitty had to look everywhere for the kittens after they ran off!
Dialogue||I don't <i>hate</i> the doggy, even if it chases my kittens. Kitty has tried to make friends with dogs before, but it's so hard, nyan! They just wanna chase Kitty, usually!
Dialogue||Kitty has been friends with dog Amari before, so why can't cats and dogs get along?!
Dialogue||Do you think your kittens are in danger?
Dialogue||I hope your kitties are okay!
Dialogue||Nya. It's fine, mostly. I always scoop them up quick quick when I hear the dog coming, now. Kitty has very good hearing, you know!
Dialogue||Dogs and cats getting along would be so cute.
Dialogue||Dogs and cats aren't supposed to get along.
Dialogue||See, nya? You get it, XX! Kitties and puppies being friends, friends, friends! Very cute, yes?
Dialogue||Nyan. That's not a great way to look at the world. It must be so sad, thinking you couldn't be someone's friend just because of how you are!
Dialogue||Let me clear something up - you're still not getting any discounts.
Dialogue||Hup-two-three-four, hup-two-three-four... Oh! Hey, didn't see you for a second. Sorry, my mind is kind of wandering right now.
Dialogue||What was that hup-two thing you were saying?
Dialogue||What has your mind wandering?
Dialogue||Ohh, was I saying it out loud again? Ah, Kitty heard me doing it once and she started repeating it for a whole week. I dunno if she was just being silly or making fun of me!
Dialogue||It's the beat we learned to march to when I attended military training in the Great City. It's drilled into my brain. I'll... never get rid of it.
Dialogue||I love my life and duty, but the daily grind can get a little dull. It gives me lots of time to think, but sometimes I end up daydreaming a bit.
Dialogue||Heh, does that sound bad? Daydreaming on the job?
Dialogue||You did military training in the Great City?
Dialogue||You must mean you trained at the Military Academy.
Dialogue||Yeah! You're originally from the Great City, too, right? Maybe we passed by each other one day and never realized. Pretty crazy, huh?
Dialogue||The Military Academy there is second to none. I was very fortunate to get in, all thanks to my mom. It was strict, but I survived. Came out better for it, too.
Dialogue||Oh right, you're originally from the Great City yourself, aren't you? So of course you know about the grand Military Academy.
Dialogue||The Academy there is second to none. I was very fortunate to get in, all thanks to my mom. It was strict, but I survived. Came out better for it, too.
Dialogue||You're only human, it's fine to slip up a little.
Dialogue||You're way too lax to be captain of the guard.
Dialogue||Thanks for not being hard on me about it, XX. Good people like you are why I do what I do! The grind is always worth it, no matter how dull.
Dialogue||Speaking of which, I need to get back to work... Hup-two-three-four...
Dialogue||Do you really mean that? I guess that puts things into perspective. Maybe I need to buckle down and stay more focused.
Dialogue||Hi, XX. You look distracted. Is there something on your mind?
Dialogue||Oh, I was just imagining being rich. What would you do if you were rich?
Dialogue||Actually, I was thinking... of asking you on a date.
Dialogue||I think I would buy a big house and start my own school. That would be a dream come true, actually.
Dialogue||XX... I've been hoping you would ask me that, but now I'm afraid I'm dreaming!
Dialogue||That's not a very fun answer.
Dialogue||That's very you, Jun!
Dialogue||No? Well I'm concerned with being more helpful than fun.
Dialogue||Ah, do you already know me so well? I'm flattered!
Dialogue||Actually Jun, I don't think this is the best time.
Dialogue||Don't be silly - this is real! What do you say?
Dialogue||And just like that, the dream becomes a nightmare...
Dialogue||Absolutely, this is exactly what I've wanted!
Dialogue||XX, let's meet outside my house tomorrow at 10:00 am.
Dialogue||Looks like you're making yourself right at home in Sun Haven! It took me a while to really get comfortable here as a native.
Dialogue||So what brought you to Sun Haven to begin with?
Dialogue||Did you ever go to see Elios on Dragon's Meet?
Dialogue||You could say my work brought me here. But really, I just needed a change. There came a time when I realized that the island just wasn't home to me anymore.
Dialogue||No, I haven't visited the Sun Dragon. When I first arrived here, Lucia told me that I should wait a while before seeing him.
Dialogue||I don't see what Elios would do for me, anyway. I don't mean any disrespect, but I don't use magic - I'm a doctor. I stick to what I know.
Dialogue||You must miss your family and friends, though.
Dialogue||Do you ever wonder how the island managed without you?
Dialogue||These days, I keep myself looking forward. No point in looking back when there's a beautiful future ahead. I'm sure you can relate, having just moved here yourself.
Dialogue||I'm sure Elios could help your practice, somehow.
Dialogue||You seem to know what's best for yourself, I'd trust your instincts.
Dialogue||I don't mean to offend you, but you just don't know what you're talking about.
Dialogue||Thank you, XX. Sure, the idea that Elios can magically make your life better is appealing, but it's not helpful to me.
Dialogue||Hey there, "business partner."
Dialogue||Emma is shortest but only by a tiny bit.
Dialogue||Hey XX, I was just thinking about you. Actually, you've been on my mind a lot lately.
Dialogue||Oh yeah? I hope they've been good thoughts.
Dialogue||I've been thinking about you a lot, too.
Dialogue||They definitely have been. In fact XX, I was hoping we could go out on another date soon.
Dialogue||I trust that you're not thinking poorly of me, but the little voice in my head can't help but worry.
Dialogue||Actually Wornhardt, I don't think we should.
Dialogue||That sounds wonderful!
Dialogue||Oh... Lost interest, huh? That's okay. It happens.
Dialogue||Fantastic! Meet me at my house tomorrow at 5:00 pm. XX, this is going to be great!
Dialogue||Don't worry Wornhardt, I only have positive thoughts about you.
Dialogue||Sometimes I do think of you in a romantic way.
Dialogue||Heh... you don't know how much of a relief it is to hear you say that.
Dialogue||Oh? Well now I'm really curious! If it's gushy romantic stuff, you don't need to be embarrassed.
Dialogue||We're adults, XX. We've all seen gushy romance before, and we all know how embarrassing it is!
Dialogue||Hey now, there's my favorite farmer! I hope you have a long and successful stint on the farm, XX.
Dialogue||Do you consider yourself successful, Wornhardt?
Dialogue||So what's your plan for the long term, Wornhardt?
Dialogue||Wow, that's a hefty question. Let me think a moment...
Dialogue||You know, I think I do. Mainly because I found a place I'm happy to call home. That's all the success I need.
Dialogue||Long term, huh? I'll be honest with you. I'm still kind of getting myself settled into life here. I haven't thought one bit about any far future. I'm really just trying to enjoy the moment.
Dialogue||You're a surprisingly simple guy, Wornhardt.
Dialogue||I hope to find success the way you have.
Dialogue||Thanks, but you might not think that once you get to know me better!
Dialogue||Just hang in there, XX. I'm completely certain that you'll find your success someday soon.
Dialogue||That's pretty irresponsible, especially for a doctor.
Dialogue||Focusing on the present is important.
Dialogue||What's irresponsible is expecting too much of yourself - and others.
Dialogue||We both agree on that! It's easy to get caught up in life and forget to enjoy yourself.
Dialogue||Remember our date by the windmills? Now <i>that</i> was enjoying the moment.
Dialogue||I'm actually very quick but this armor is really heavy.
Dialogue||Hello there, farmer. Do you hear the birds today? There are so many songs to listen to!
Dialogue||Anyway, what's on your mind?
Dialogue||Are you seeing anybody in town, Wornhardt?
Dialogue||Wornhardt, I want to ask you... on a date!
Dialogue||Me? Oh, no. I mean, some people have certainly caught my eye, but I don't really put myself "out there" if you know what I mean.
Dialogue||Oh! Haha, that's the last thing I was expecting! It sounds fun to me, I guess I'm just a little surprised that you're interested.
Dialogue||You know, you could change that whenever you want!
Dialogue||You don't seem like the type of person to do that.
Dialogue||Oh! Really, you think? I guess I am a doctor, after all. Who knows, maybe now is the right time for me to get "out there."
Dialogue||I'm... not sure how to take that?
Dialogue||So, what do you say?
Dialogue||Maybe it's not the best idea after all.
Dialogue||XX, of course I'd like to go out with you! Why don't we meet out front of the hospital at 10:00 am tomorrow?
Dialogue||Oh no? Hm, that's disappointing. But, I'm glad you thought it through.
Dialogue||Hey, good lookin'!
Dialogue||So should I call you sweetie now?
Dialogue||Being together is a relief - I was getting tired of flirting.
Dialogue||Call me anything other than Anne, and I'll buy your farm out from under you. Then you'll be farmless!
Dialogue||Yeah, I was getting tired of your flirting too!
Dialogue||There's no way you could afford that.
Dialogue||I would laugh, but I know you really could.
Dialogue||Don't make me prove you wrong, XX!
Dialogue||You're smart. I actually thought about buying that land a while back. Good thing I didn't or you wouldn't have a home.
Dialogue||Hey, that's uncalled for!
Dialogue||Wait, was I bad at flirting?
Dialogue||Relax, I'm just messing with you. I'm glad we're done playing games, too. Being together is loads easier.
Dialogue||I'm bad with compliments, but you look really good today.
Dialogue||Are there any spots outside of your house that you like?
Dialogue||I had fun on our date the other day. We should do that again!
Dialogue||There's a waterfall below the cliff outside my house. Sometimes I sit there when I need to clear my head.
Dialogue||Oh, you're being serious? Sorry, I just thought you must be joking.
Dialogue||Okay then, if you want that XX then I'd be happy to.
Dialogue||I knew it would be something like that!
Dialogue||That doesn't count.
Dialogue||Hey, it's a pretty spot. I can admire a lot of your farm from there, too.
Dialogue||Have you met me? I don't go places.
Dialogue||Actually, maybe we shouldn't.
Dialogue||I'm completely serious, Claude!
Dialogue||Ah, I see. I knew something like this would happen.
Dialogue||In that case, meet me at my house again. Let's say 12:00 pm tomorrow. We can have a sort of picnic... outside.
Dialogue||Withergate is especially lively these days. Maybe we have you to thank for that, XX.
Dialogue||I've got a busy day so unless you're giving free back massages, you should keep walking.
Dialogue||It may be a cold night, XX. If you need help starting a fire, I need only cast a simple spell. Don't be afraid to ask!
Dialogue||Actually, I wanted to ask you about your magic. When did you discover it?
Dialogue||What do you like most about your magic?
Dialogue||Don't worry, most people have questions when they meet me.
Dialogue||I became Blessed when I was eight years old. My magical abilities strengthened dramatically, though I'll admit there was a bit of a learning curve.
Dialogue||This was long before I had any skill with magic. That is to say, it was completely out of my control.
Dialogue||Thankfully, my late grandfather taught me some control. Those times spent training with him as a child are some of my most cherished memories.
Dialogue||Oh, it's certainly useful for everyday things. But more than that, it has earned me respect as a young leader.
Dialogue||Having been blessed by Elios, Sun Haven's citizens rallied behind me as a strong user of magic. Being Blessed shows not only power, but discipline and competence.
Dialogue||Pod even called me his "guiding light!" It was just darling!
Dialogue||It seems irresponsible to give that power to a child.
Dialogue||No wonder you're so skilled with it!
Dialogue||I wouldn't go that far, XX. Elios never acts in ignorance and only does what is best for Sun Haven. He knew I was to become a powerful leader for the people of this town.
Dialogue||Controlling my magic has been a lifelong journey, one that I'm still on. Over time, I developed a profound relationship with magic.
Dialogue||That journey helped me become the leader I needed to be for Sun Haven - an Archmage.
Dialogue||What everyday things can be done with fire magic?
Dialogue||Do you think your job is easier because of your magic?
Dialogue||Well firstly, I never need a lantern. I also power the lighthouse with a charm that lasts through each night.
Dialogue||Oh yes, and I keep all of the torches in town alight when it rains. It's actually quite fun for me to walk through the rain and hear it sizzle away on my skin.
Dialogue||Certainly, it gives me an advantage. However, Sun Haven needs any and all advantages it can get right now.
Dialogue||Even when it's struggling, Sun Haven is a gorgeous town. And having you here makes it that much better!
Dialogue||Are you worried about Sun Haven, with the monster town nearby?
Dialogue||Do you have a favorite spot in town?
Dialogue||Are you talking about Withergate? I'm not worried about monsters attacking the city, if that's what you're asking. I am concerned for Sun Haven's people, though.
Dialogue||It's never good when tensions are high throughout a whole community.
Dialogue||It isn't very exciting, but I love my home. I have a bench to sit on outside, and when the sun sets over the wheat field... is it silly to call that my happy place?
Dialogue||People will just panic and make things worse.
Dialogue||I have faith in the people here.
Dialogue||I can't say I agree. You'd be surprised how good people can be when given the chance. I hope you get to see that goodness in action soon, because it sounds like you need it.
Dialogue||I agree wholeheartedly. Sun Haven is blessed with thoughtful and caring citizens. Like you, XX.
Dialogue||I don't think it's silly - it sounds beautiful!
Dialogue||Isn't there anywhere else you like to go?
Dialogue||You're welcome to come by, then. I can't think of a better way to spend time with yourself than in a quiet, beautiful space. I'm lucky to call it my home.
Dialogue||Well, I can just barely peep the top of your farmhouse from my home. Honestly, your farm looks really peaceful too - at least from what I've seen.
Dialogue||I thought marriage would be scary, but it really isn't. Not with you, XX.
Dialogue||Hello, XX. Have a wonderful day.
Dialogue||Farmer! Are you here for playtime?
Dialogue||Maybe next time, Pod.
Dialogue||What is your favorite game?
Dialogue||Aw, boring. You should play more, then you wouldn't be so boring.
Dialogue||I love tag the most. I'm really good at it, especially when we play hide-and-tag.
Dialogue||I can't play because I'm too busy with work.
Dialogue||I can't play because I'm... going to fight monsters!
Dialogue||I wanted you to be a fun grown up. You're just a regular grown up though.
Dialogue||No way! Real live monsters, not just pretend??
Dialogue||Topi is scared of monsters, but not me.
Dialogue||What do you like most about tag?
Dialogue||What's your best hiding spot?
Dialogue||I get to run around a lot. Topi is faster than me but I fit under the bushes where he can't get me!
Dialogue||No way, I won't tell you or you'll tell Topi.
Dialogue||XX! Are you happy to see me? I'm happy to see you, of course!
Dialogue||Kitty, I have a special question for you. Do you want to go on a date?
Dialogue||Are you okay? You look anxious.
Dialogue||A date? With XX, and Kitty? For real, nya?
Dialogue||Kitty's excited! I have a surprise for you, XX. A gift from me!
Dialogue||Yes, for real!
Dialogue||Actually Kitty, I think it's a mistake.
Dialogue||OH MY GOSH! Yes XX, nyaaa! You can meet me in front of my house in the morning at 10:00 am for our first date!
Dialogue||Oh no, is it my fault? Whatever it was, I didn't mean it...
Dialogue||You got me something?
Dialogue||Thanks Kitty! What is it?
Dialogue||I made it myself! It's a toy to keep you from getting bored, nya. It's my favorite one, and it's for you because you're my favorite friend! Here, take it take it!
Dialogue||XX? You're... <i>gazing</i> at me. It's almost romantic, though. Almost.
Dialogue||I've been thinking about our future.
Dialogue||Anne, are you happy with our relationship?
Dialogue||Our future? I've got a plan for my own future, XX.
Dialogue||If your future plan joins with mine, then great! But I'm not changing course anytime soon.
Dialogue||Whoa - that was out of the blue! What, you think I'll leave you for a business opportunity or something?
Dialogue||Sure, my life is a constant race with money at the goal, but that's business. And I still want to race, you know?
Dialogue||But now I have you and suddenly I find myself thinking of something other than the next big score.
Dialogue||Wow... I wasn't even sure of that until I said it out loud!
Dialogue||I would expect nothing less from you, Anne.
Dialogue||I love that about you - you're as determined as a young dragon.
Dialogue||I feel like that can be taken either as an insult or a compliment, so I'll choose compliment!
Dialogue||Ooh, you said a young dragon? I like that! Maybe I should make that my shop's new insignia.
Dialogue||Do you ever really stop thinking about money?
Dialogue||Maybe what you need is a partner in your race.
Dialogue||Nope. Never have, never will. If you ever want to have a life with me down the road, you have to consider that.
Dialogue||Aw, using my own analogy to say something sweet! Unoriginal, but sweet. I knew there was a reason I fell for you, XX.
Dialogue||Maybe you're right - maybe I could use a partner like you in my race. But if you join me, it has to be for good.
Dialogue||Are you getting the hint, XX? Well here's another - I could really use a new ring!
Dialogue||I love seeing you around town, XX. You make Sun Haven a little more perfect!
Dialogue||I feel like I could tell you anything, Jun.
Dialogue||What does a perfect day look like for you?
Dialogue||I cherish the ability to gain someone's trust. People confide in me because I'm good at keeping secrets - really good. You can trust me more than anyone, XX.
Dialogue||Hm, good question. I'd most likely paint in the morning and walk around town in the afternoon. I enjoy seeing the people that I know just living their lives.
Dialogue||Then in the evening, I would watch the sunset from my house with a nice, hearty salad.
Dialogue||You had my trust a long time ago.
Dialogue||On second thought, I'm not so sure.
Dialogue||To hear you say that... Well, the feeling is mutual. I don't have as many people to confide in as I have confiding in me, so I'm grateful to have you, XX.
Dialogue||I understand. Take your time, XX.
Dialogue||Everything about that screams, "Jun."
Dialogue||I can't think of a more perfect day.
Dialogue||Oh, I forgot something important! The day wouldn't be perfect without you in it, XX.
Dialogue||It's great to see you, XX... Whoa, you're staring pretty hard. Is something wrong?
Dialogue||I've been waiting a while to say this, but... you have some really great hair!
Dialogue||Sorry, I didn't mean to stare.
Dialogue||Oh! Hah, thank you. It actually grew out before I moved here, when I wasn't taking very good care of myself. But then I decided to keep it!
Dialogue||No harm done, XX. I know I can look a bit run down at times. That's to be expected after twelve years of medical work.
Dialogue||It definitely suits you.
Dialogue||It looks like you're taking better care of yourself now.
Dialogue||I'm glad you think so. It's always nice getting unexpected compliments.
Dialogue||Thanks! I must be having a really good hair day, haha!
Dialogue||Actually, I was going to say that you look pretty good!
Dialogue||It's nothing a good night's sleep can't fix.
Dialogue||Oh? Heh, you're a real charmer, XX! I hope we get to spend a lot of time together.
Dialogue||Oh? Hm. I wasn't really looking for that kind of advice, but thank you anyway.
Dialogue||Are the fish biting for you?
Dialogue||You're strong from farming, but I've gained some muscle from my work too. I wonder which of us is stronger... Oh, I don't mean that as a challenge!
Dialogue||Hello, XX. Don't mind me, I was just recalling a memory of my grandfather.
Dialogue||Do you have any favorite memories of your training days?
Dialogue||Your grandfather must have been an extraordinary person.
Dialogue||Of course! All my memories with my grandfather are dear to me, though some stories really stick out, like this one time...
Dialogue||Early in my training, it was obvious how talented I was. I got such an attitude! Grandfather proposed a challenge, and I eagerly accepted.
Dialogue||I was challenged with igniting four torches, and to keep them all blazing simultaneously. I thought it sounded like a breeze, and went at it with all my power.
Dialogue||...Which is exactly what Grandfather knew I'd do. In the end, I completely incinerated the torches in my attempt to keep them all aflame. I had little control of my magic.
Dialogue||I'd completely failed the challenge, but the experience taught me a very important thing: humility. I'll never forget it.
Dialogue||He was indeed. Though he wasn't Blessed, as you and I are, it didn't stop him from applying basic, universal principles to my training.
Dialogue||Those principles are what helped forge me, and I live by them to this day.
Dialogue||That was quite the story, Lucia. Thanks for sharing it.
Dialogue||Wow, you really do have some great stories to tell.
Dialogue||Don't mention it, XX. I love remembering my days with my grandfather. I should thank you for listening.
Dialogue||That's very touching, Lucia.
Dialogue||Yeah but he's gone now, so forget about it.
Dialogue||It is, isn't it? My grandfather and grandmother may be gone now, but I can keep them both alive by teaching others the lessons I learned from him.
Dialogue||You should really learn which thoughts are best kept to yourself, XX.
Dialogue||I'm soooo bored in school. The work is easy because I'm the oldest kid in class.
Dialogue||Are you the oldest kid in town ,too?
Dialogue||You could ask for more challenging work.
Dialogue||I'm the oldest, unless you count Kitty.
Dialogue||I guess... but what if it's too hard then?
Dialogue||Why would I count Kitty?
Dialogue||Actually, I do count kitty.
Dialogue||She acts funny. She even plays with us, sometimes!
Dialogue||You're smart, you'll figure it out.
Dialogue||Then you work harder!
Dialogue||If it means I'm less bored then maybe I will. Thanks, XX!
Dialogue||Nooooo XX, I don't want that at all.
Dialogue||Look at us, married! It's like a little story book - The Farmer and the Witch.
Dialogue||Eh, maybe not.
Dialogue||I think "The Farmer and the Witch" sounds cute.
Dialogue||Is marriage everything you thought it would be?
Dialogue||Hehe, oh yeah? Then I guess this is the first chapter of our story together.
Dialogue||You know, I never thought about it that much. I only wanted to be in love and connect with someone on a deep level.
Dialogue||I think I really have that with you, XX. So I suppose marriage really is everything I thought it would be!
Dialogue||Let's make it's a fun story!
Dialogue||It will be the first of many.
Dialogue||Oh, XX. I was lucky to marry someone like you. I knew it all along.
Dialogue||My connection to you is unlike anything else.
Dialogue||I don't really get what you mean.
Dialogue||That makes me so happy to know, XX. I knew you were the one I was meant to be with.
Dialogue||Well, I can't expect everything about our marriage to be perfect. It's fine if you don't quite get what I mean, though I really wish you did.
Dialogue||Hey, you're that new farmer. Whatever you need, I can help - for a price!
Dialogue||Or are you just looking to chat?
Dialogue||You seem to like it here.
Dialogue||I don't think we were properly introduced. You're Anne?
Dialogue||What's not to like? Good weather means a lot of foot traffic, and a reputation as a trading hub sure doesn't hurt business either. Plus, I can enjoy the sunshine when business is slow.
Dialogue||Whoops, that's not the first time that's happened. Yep, I'm Anne, the best merchant in Sun Haven and don't let anybody tell you different!
Dialogue||It doesn't feel right to judge a town by the money it makes you.
Dialogue||I can appreciate a business-minded person like yourself.
Dialogue||I'm not sure, but it's definitely not right to judge people you just met.
Dialogue||You sound like you really get it. I look forward to seeing you around town - and I mean that in every sense!
Dialogue||Are you from Sun Haven originally?
Dialogue||What brought you to Sun Haven in the first place?
Dialogue||I got my start farther west. Traveled a lot for work. If you ask me, every big city is the same. Same people, same dirty streets, same same same.
Dialogue||But then I heard about Sun Haven and thought, "That sounds different."
Dialogue||It was a risk coming here, but risk often leads to reward. For me, anyway.
Dialogue||Hey farmer, can you teach me magics?
Dialogue||You want to learn how to do magic?
Dialogue||What would you do if you knew magic?
Dialogue||I tried to ask the red lady, but she just laughed and said I wasn't old enough! I'm old enough, aren't I?
Dialogue||I'd use a spell that makes Topi stop liking Elizabeth! And then I'd turn into a dragon!
Dialogue||If your mom says it's okay, then I'll teach you.
Dialogue||She was right, Pod.
Dialogue||Really?? Oh, I better go ask Mama!
Dialogue||Nooo, that's not true! I <i>am</i> old enough to learn magics!
Dialogue||Why don't you want Topi to like Elizabeth?
Dialogue||What would you do if you were a dragon?
Dialogue||It's because when she's around he only pays attention to her. I don't like it!
Dialogue||I would fly around and burn everything up! Hehehehe!
Dialogue||Solon had me working double-time yesterday. My shoulders are still sore...
Dialogue||I can't wait to see you order around the castle guard. What a treat that shall be to see!
Dialogue||I made myself a witch, but you made me a wife. Now I'm a witch-wife! Which wife? Your wife!
Dialogue||Doing homework stinks...
Dialogue||We're lucky to have so much rain here in Sun Haven. After a good rain, everything is all green and lush.
Dialogue||Be honest - does my armor look shinier today? I'm trying a new wax but I haven't noticed a difference.
Dialogue||Sheesh, you're cute... OH - did I say that out loud??
Dialogue||Keep walking.
Dialogue||Sorry, what did you say? I was off in my own world.
Dialogue||It's a good day to watch the windmills.
Dialogue||I like to keep in shape. I try to exercise every day outside of work.
Dialogue||I'm really glad we met on that train into town, XX. It's been really nice having a friend from the start.
Dialogue||Good day, XX. Have you gotten to know the town already? I'm still working on it.
Dialogue||Are you liking this town, Lynn?
Dialogue||Have you found any nice places in Sun Haven so far?
Dialogue||Well... I do miss my home, but everyone here is really really nice. Then again, Kitty can be a handful, and Anne scares me a little bit.
Dialogue||Overall, I guess I was expecting it to be more active. What do you think?
Dialogue||I love being in the quarry, especially at sunset. Don't make fun of me, but I imagine all the ore hiding inside the rocks just waiting to be turned into beautiful armor.
Dialogue||Plus, there's an echo!
Dialogue||I think Sun Haven is already on its way back up.
Dialogue||I think this town is on its way out.
Dialogue||Wow, do you think so? Who knows, maybe you're right. At least, I hope you're right, XX.
Dialogue||Oh, no, please don't say that - we must stay positive.
Dialogue||Why do you go at sunset?
Dialogue||I've never heard of someone so passionate about rocks!
Dialogue||The light at sunset makes all the rocks stand out. You can see the layers of rock in different colors - that's called stratification! I think it's gorgeous.
Dialogue||No fair, I said no teasing! But, well, you're not wrong either.
Dialogue||Jordan really saved me today. I forgot to do an egg wash on the bread last night, but he came in early and took care of it for me.
Dialogue||He really helps out, huh?
Dialogue||Are you being replaced as the town's best baker?
Dialogue||Jordan? Absolutely! I just wish I could pay him more... Anyway, he seems to genuinely like working in the bakery.
Dialogue||Heh, I don't know about that. But Jordan really is a skilled baker. I wouldn't be surprised if he opened his own shop one day!
Dialogue||He's a good friend.
Dialogue||You really should pay him better.
Dialogue||Yeah, I guess he is a friend!
Dialogue||I don't know why, but I've only ever thought of him as my coworker. But we've worked together for so long, how could we not be friends?
Dialogue||I'm paying all I can afford right now, XX. Please don't make me feel worse about it.
Dialogue||Wouldn't that be competition for you?
Dialogue||I'm glad you're supportive of him.
Dialogue||Oh. Right. Aw man, what if he bakes better bread than I do?
Dialogue||I better start thinking of some specialty items... and I should stop telling Jordan all my recipes.
Dialogue||Yeah... wait, do you think that's a bad idea? What if he becomes my competition? And what if he bakes better bread than me?
Dialogue||I'm thinking about investing in some property around Sun Haven.
Dialogue||I didn't take you for a property dealer.
Dialogue||Which property were you looking at?
Dialogue||Only sometimes. It's profitable, but I prefer to be able to pick up and travel with my goods.
Dialogue||Until I find someone versed in magic who knows how to move land, property is a firmly fixed asset.
Dialogue||The mines! Can you believe no one really owns it? Bernard at the town hall might sell me the deed of ownership. It's incredibly expensive, but just imagine!
Dialogue||I could charge an entry fee, a minecart fee, a charge for ore collection... so many options!
Dialogue||You should buy a farm, like me!
Dialogue||Someone that can move land? That's a wild idea!
Dialogue||Hm, no thanks. You of all people should know that land meant for farming needs considerable preparation and upkeep.
Dialogue||I've no interest in hiring workers to turn undeveloped land into something worth reselling. And I'm sure not doing it myself!
Dialogue||Hey, I didn't entirely mean it as a joke. If someone can dream it, then they can do it. And then I can pay them to do it for me!
Dialogue||If there is someone out there who can actually move land, then I'll find them, contract them, and make a fortune!
Dialogue||What would we get in return for those fees?
Dialogue||That sounds greedy.
Dialogue||Well for starters, did you know the entire mine is dangerously unstable? It'll need to have support beams installed, which isn't cheap.
Dialogue||And the minecart tracks haven't been cleaned or repaired since being laid down years and years ago.
Dialogue||There's a lot of work to be done and it won't come cheap, but I can make it happen if I'm smart about it.
Dialogue||I might charge people to use the mines, but then I'd also be responsible for making sure it's safe - something no one is doing.
Dialogue||It's a lot more than just me making a quick buck, but thanks for assuming the worst of me XX.
Dialogue||I think the girls are planning to attack you with stickers the next time you're over. Don't say I didn't warn you!
Dialogue||If there's ever a night you aren't busy, you'll really have to join us for dinner sometime.
Dialogue||What do you like to do when you aren't busy?
Dialogue||What would you do if you couldn't deliver mail anymore?
Dialogue||Sometimes I pose for Giuseppe when he needs a model for a new sculpture, or painting, or whatever art phase he's in.
Dialogue||When I'm all alone, though? I actually enjoy a little birdwatching! The trees near my house always have a bird or two chirping away, so I can make a cup of tea and watch right out the window.
Dialogue||That's a funny question. My courier job fits my lifestyle so well that I don't know what I could replace it with. Hm, maybe I'd work with Solon at the smithery?
Dialogue||Now <i>that</i> would be a physical challenge.
Dialogue||That sounds so peaceful for you.
Dialogue||That sounds so boring.
Dialogue||Heh, people are always surprised to learn that about me. Even I know that you have to slow down once in a while.
Dialogue||Oh? Well, it's not for everyone. Kitty, on the other hand, <i>loves</i> it. I've even seen her waiting in the trees for birds to come by!
Dialogue||You know, I wonder if she was doing more than just watching the birds...
Dialogue||I could see you working at an anvil.
Dialogue||You could be a physical trainer.
Dialogue||Is that so? Giuseppe has his sculptures so maybe I could try metalworking. I know he'd love that since he's always encouraging me to find new ways to express myself.
Dialogue||You mean like a teacher, but for exercise? That's... a really good idea! Maybe someday I'll hang up my courier pouch and open my own training grounds!
Dialogue||It feels like seeing you has become part of my routine, like pruning my plants.
Dialogue||It must be a lot of work caring for all those plants.
Dialogue||I'm too eager to wait - let's go on another date!
Dialogue||Of course, but I love them! Plants are sensitive and reactive - just like people.
Dialogue||I don't know, I guess sometimes I feel more connected to plants than people. That must sound weird...
Dialogue||Oh! XX, you're such a sweetheart. I'm flattered that you're thinking about me!
Dialogue||You're right, that's weird.
Dialogue||Not at all, there's a lot we can learn from plants.
Dialogue||See, this is why I prefer plants.
Dialogue||Exactly! I'm glad you agree. It makes me feel like less of an oddball.
Dialogue||Actually, I'm starting to think we should just be friends.
Dialogue||Is that so? Well jeez XX, that's pretty disappointing. But, I'm glad that we still get to be friends.
Dialogue||Absolutely, yes XX. Come by my house tomorrow at 5:00 pm. I can't wait!
Dialogue||Adding the old farm to my delivery route should boost my cardio nicely!
Dialogue||XX, my better half! Life in Sun Haven is perfect now that we're together.
Dialogue||Do you think people will talk about us?
Dialogue||How long do you expect to stay in Sun Haven?
Dialogue||Knowing the people in this town... most likely, yes. But what does it matter? I don't care a bit, personally.
Dialogue||Oh, I don't plan to leave ever. This town has my heart... like you. That isn't a problem, is it?
Dialogue||You're right, it shouldn't matter.
Dialogue||I can't help but think about it.
Dialogue||You've got a good head on your shoulders, XX.
Dialogue||If it really bothers you, just remember that it will pass. Gossip doesn't last forever, right?
Dialogue||Not at all - I feel the same way.
Dialogue||I can't imagine staying here forever.
Dialogue||You don't know how much of a relief it is to hear you say that.
Dialogue||Oh... Is that so? I'm surprised that you feel that way, XX.
Dialogue||You work real hard, don't you? I wonder if you've made as much money as I have since coming to Sun Haven!
Dialogue||How much money have you made?
Dialogue||What do you make all your money for, anyway?
Dialogue||Well, a good merchant never sells and tells. I'm not going to give up sensitive information like that!
Dialogue||Don't forget, information can fill a wallet just as quick as it can drain it.
Dialogue||At first, it was simple survival. But then I learned to like the taste of success and the comforts that come with it.
Dialogue||You're just being dramatic.
Dialogue||That's a smart precaution for a business owner.
Dialogue||Call it dramatic if you like, XX. I've been in the game a long time, so I know I'm not just blowing smoke.
Dialogue||It might sound like I'm being dramatic, but I've been in the game a long time.  I know I'm not just blowing smoke.
Dialogue||Oh, but it's not that I don't trust <i>you</i>, of course.
Dialogue||You're a very driven person.
Dialogue||At least invest everything wisely.
Dialogue||True, but I still know how to have fun! I'll slow down some day. Maybe in the distant future, heh.
Dialogue||Wisely? XX, you're a farmer! You want me to invest in potatoes? Oh wait, I already did - it's called dinner!
Dialogue||Oh. The farmer, right?
Dialogue||Sore arms, sore back, sore legs, tired eyes... Smithing is a full-body workout.
Dialogue||I've heard people calling you farmer a lot. Do you like that? I think it's endearing!
Dialogue||Do you have any nicknames?
Dialogue||The people here really are nice.
Dialogue||Well... All right, XX. I'll tell you this because I'm starting to really trust you. But please don't repeat this!
Dialogue||My grandfather called me "cinderhead" when I was a child. Usually when I was getting up to mischief. And - just between us, XX! - I still call myself cinderhead sometimes.
Dialogue||The citizens are my favorite thing about Sun Haven. They make this town what it is. Without them, I would have no purpose here. What's a leader without people behind her?
Dialogue||What if I started calling you cinderhead?
Dialogue||I promise I'll keep your nickname a secret!
Dialogue||I'm afraid that would necessitate a hostile response...
Dialogue||I'm joking, XX! Though the look on your face was certainly satisfying.
Dialogue||I believe you, XX. I don't know why, but I felt a sense of trust in you the moment we met.
Dialogue||I'd like to get to know the people better.
Dialogue||A leader should be able to stand alone.
Dialogue||Oh, good!
Dialogue||Perhaps try to strike up conversations with more of your neighbors. Getting to know people is the best way to find one's place in a new community.
Dialogue||I don't mean to offend you, XX, but that is a truly ignorant statement. It's clear you've never been in a position of leadership.
Dialogue||Something smells fishy... oh, that's me.
Dialogue||Hey XX. Have you put on some muscle? You look really good!
Dialogue||I haven't asked, what kind of music do you listen to?
Dialogue||So when are we going out again?
Dialogue||I don't have many records, but I like anything with a good rhythm. Something you can move your body to, you know what I mean?
Dialogue||You really think you're in for a second date, huh? Just like that?
Dialogue||Sounds like you need to expand your tastes.
Dialogue||We should hit the dance floor sometime!
Dialogue||I have the best taste in town, thanks very much.
Dialogue||Wow, a farmer AND a dancer? You must fancy yourself quite the catch!
Dialogue||Of course I do!
Dialogue||Actually, maybe that's not the best idea.
Dialogue||Then let's do it! Come by my cart at 4:00 pm tomorrow.
Dialogue||Oh... really? Well, all right then XX. If that's what you think.
Dialogue||Yesterday a man flew out of the sky! I told Lucia but I don't think she believed me...
Dialogue||I believe you!
Dialogue||What did this person want?
Dialogue||Yeah? I knew you would believe Kitty, XX! Thank you for always being good to me, nya.
Dialogue||The man said his name was Vaan. He was an Elf from the forest!
Dialogue||I don't think he wanted anything, nya. He said he was only visiting. But he hid from the guards when they came by, and then he left! He was a funny guy, hehe.
Dialogue||Okay, now your story is getting a little far fetched.
Dialogue||I hope he was nice to you.
Dialogue||Nyan!? You don't believe me after all...
Dialogue||He was very nice indeed, yep! He asked me what I do here. And then he gave me some greenroot, yuck!
Dialogue||It's weird that he didn't want anything.
Dialogue||I can't blame him for wanting to visit!
Dialogue||I had the same thought after he left. I guess Sun Haven is popular to everyone - even sky Elves!
Dialogue||Me neither, nya! I had the same thought after he left. Sun Haven is popular to everyone - even sky Elves!
Dialogue||Good day, XX. I have a spot of free time if you would like to chat.
Dialogue||Is there anything you'd like to know?
Dialogue||I'm curious... what's your favorite dessert?
Dialogue||So is your hair naturally red, or is that magic too?
Dialogue||There's a delectable dish I've only ever found in other regions. It's called moon cream pie. If you have the opportunity to try it, I recommend that you do!
Dialogue||I will never understand the people's fascination with my hair. Catherine's hair is much more colorful!
Dialogue||I don't get it. What's it like?
Dialogue||Is it really that hard to find?
Dialogue||It's like... Oh, this almost certainly sound like nonsense... But it tastes like sweet moonlight. Imagine a cream that is so fluffy that it makes you feel lighter when you eat it.
Dialogue||I once asked Liam to try making it, but it didn't come out quite right. Oh, but let's keep that between us!
Dialogue||I didn't want to hurt his feelings, so I told him it was perfect. I know I shouldn't have lied, but I couldn't crush Liam like that.
Dialogue||You're right, her hair is prettier than yours.
Dialogue||Sure, but yours looks like actual fire.
Dialogue||I didn't quite mean that...
Dialogue||Well... thank you. I admit that it is a coincidence, but it's nothing more than that.
Dialogue||The animals seem extra playful today, nya!
Dialogue||I'm fine today, thanks. Just stretching my legs before I go back to work... where I stand all day.
Dialogue||To be honest with you XX, I'm really trying not to screw this up with you.
Dialogue||Have you been taking a little extra relaxation time? You're looking really good!
Dialogue||You're looking good too, doctor!
Dialogue||So how does Sun Haven's doctor relax?
Dialogue||You think so, huh? I've been trying to exercise a bit more lately. Good to know it shows!
Dialogue||The tavern is so warm and cozy, it's the best place to unwind. Ronald and Mari are fun conversationalists too, and if I'm lucky I'll catch Camila there in the evening. I often have good talks with her.
Dialogue||Oh, I was only being polite.
Dialogue||I thought you must be doing something different. Good for you, doc!
Dialogue||I don't know why you would tell me that, XX.
Dialogue||You know XX, I try and make people feel good about themselves when I talk to them. But I don't often get to feel that way myself.
Dialogue||I guess I'm just trying to say thanks!
Dialogue||Are you close with Camila?
Dialogue||What's your go-to order at the tavern?
Dialogue||I guess you could say so. It's nothing romantic - she's a bit young for me that way. But she's good company on slow nights.
Dialogue||I just like a drink of something to go with a nice big burger... Oh man, now you've got me thinking about food. Did Mari send you? She's a clever one, so I wouldn't put it past her!
Dialogue||Do I look worried? It's just because I found an ingot in my pocket and I don't remember what it's for... Solon is going to chew me out over this.
Dialogue||XX, let me ask you something. Does this hat make my ears look big? You know what - forget I asked.
Dialogue||Actually, I can't tell if those are your real ears, or if that's the hat...
Dialogue||Big ears just means better hearing, right? Music must sound amazing!
Dialogue||At least you asked. Too many people just reach up and yank on them. It hurts!
Dialogue||Oh, and I suppose that answers your question. Yes, these are my ears. Please don't pull on them.
Dialogue||Oh, that is true. I absolutely love listening to the piano. Sometimes though, I just need to hear something with energy. That's when I reach for my Gavin Knapp record. They play guitar better than anyone I've ever heard!
Dialogue||I've never met a rabbit Amari before you.
Dialogue||I have to ask - do you have really really good hearing?
Dialogue||I'm happy to be your first! And yes, I have very very good hearing. I know you didn't ask, but I don't need to be a witch to see that you were about to.
Dialogue||Saw that one coming... Yep, I can hear someone whispering from across the town square.
Dialogue||Forget records, I prefer live music.
Dialogue||I never knew you had such great musical taste!
Dialogue||Well sure, live music is always better. You don't have to be a snob about it though.
Dialogue||Actually, I never listened to music that much before I had a conversation with Claude about it. No really, a full conversation!
Dialogue||Anyway, I bumped into him outside the record store and he opened me up to the world of music. Now I go to the record store every week.
Dialogue||Working hard, farmer? I suppose you'd have to, huh?
Dialogue||What do you do for work?
Dialogue||You're right, farming is hard work.
Dialogue||I rent a room out to travelers. Business has been down lately, as you can imagine.
Dialogue||Don't I know it. That's why I never bothered with farming.
Dialogue||Why wouldn't your customers just stay at the inn above the tavern?
Dialogue||That's a smart business model.
Dialogue||People are happy to pay for a private space. The inn can get pretty raucus on a busy night.
Dialogue||It was Anne's idea. She's a great resource if you're planning a business. She's good company, too!
Dialogue||Afraid of a little hard work?
Dialogue||Good thing, or I wouldn't have a job right now!
Dialogue||A good friend told me to work smart, not hard. That thinking has kept me very comfortable here.
Dialogue||Heh, I guess that's right. I'm glad it worked out for the two of us, then.
Dialogue||I knew you'd be back, XX. Something I can help you with?
Dialogue||You have good taste, right? What's your favorite food?
Dialogue||I was just wondering, have you gone to see Elios?
Dialogue||When I asked what I could do for you, I meant in terms of merchandise, but...
Dialogue||Are we talking favorite food of all time? Then I have to go with raspberry cheesecake. So creamy and rich! How can anyone say no to that?
Dialogue||I went to see the Sun Dragon on my fourth day in town. It was mostly for publicity though - don't want to snub the local traditions, right?
Dialogue||Anyway, I'm not Blessed like Lucia. Who needs magic when you've got a steady income?
Dialogue||Good to know.
Dialogue||Do you think I should try it?
Dialogue||I don't like that look on your face. Let me just say that whatever you're up to, it's not going to work and it better involve raspberry cheesecake.
Dialogue||You haven't had it before? XX, that's completely unacceptable! Go to Liam's bakery and grab a piece immediately! ... And bring me a piece too!
Dialogue||Pretending to value a town's tradition is worse than not participating in it at all.
Dialogue||You seem so strategic, no wonder you're such a success.
Dialogue||You're right, how dare I receive the Sun Dragon's blessing and make an honest living for myself! I'm so ashamed...
Dialogue||... I hope you can tell that I'm being sarcastic.
Dialogue||Ooh, surprise flattery! Be careful XX, you're starting to grow on me.
Dialogue||Nathaniel said he noticed a skip in my step. I guess I'm feeling a bit better these days.
Dialogue||XX, I had hoped to run into you today. Why? Oh, for no reason in particular!
Dialogue||Lucia, you're giving me a look.
Dialogue||So, can I start calling you cinderhead now that we're officially dating?
Dialogue||Yes indeed I am! I'm just a bit nervous. I've brought you a gift!
Dialogue||You may, but I cannot be held accountable for any burns you may suffer as a result!
Dialogue||What a surprise!
Dialogue||This is a charm to boost your magical abilities. I know you're blessed just as I am, but this charm will bring your power to the next level.
Dialogue||I made this myself when I was still young and lacked control. I don't use it much because it's more powerful than I need. I believe it could prove useful to you!
Dialogue||Fine, I won't call you cinderhead... in public.
Dialogue||Whatever you say... cinderhead.
Dialogue||Oh, now you're just pushing my buttons!
Dialogue||You're nearing the line between humor and annoyance, XX.
Dialogue||When I first came here, I didn't think I would stay. It seemed like just another stop on the road.
Dialogue||Now I've got my own home and practice here, a wonderful partner, and I've even met the Sun Dragon. It feels almost like it did back on the island.
Dialogue||You said it feels like it did on the island?
Dialogue||Do you still miss the island?
Dialogue||Yeah! Like my life is actually here, you know? I guess some people call that "putting down roots." In any case, the point is that I'm not leaving Sun Haven for a long time.
Dialogue||Sometimes, yes. I had friends there, you know. But it's behind me, and I really only remember it fondly. You don't have to worry about me running back south - this is my home now.
Dialogue||I don't know if I want to stay here.
Dialogue||I feel the same way.
Dialogue||Shoot, really? Here I thought you would want to stay for sure, especially since you have the farm. We'll have to talk about that soon.
Dialogue||I figured you would, especially since you have the farm. Obviously, you're a huge part of my decision to stay... That is obvious, right?
Dialogue||I'm sure your friends think of you, too.
Dialogue||I'm proud of you!
Dialogue||I hope so. I bet they're all happy. I hope so, anyway.
Dialogue||It's too bad Jun didn't hear me say all that. He would be ecstatic to see my progress, maybe even enough to give me a candy!
Dialogue||I know the candies are for kids, but Jun lets me take one every now and then, heheh.
Dialogue||Heh, thanks! I guess I've made some progress lately.
Dialogue||So you're staying in Sun Haven with us? I like that.
Dialogue||So you want me to stay?
Dialogue||What do you like most about Sun Haven?
Dialogue||Of course, we're friends! I want all my friends to stay.
Dialogue||I like Liam's friend Lester. He's silly, hehe.
Dialogue||I haven't decided if we're friends yet.
Dialogue||Okay, then I'll stay!
Dialogue||What? No way! You're teasing, right? I don't like teasing.
Dialogue||Yay, yay! I'm telling Liam and Emma that I got you to stay. Now we can all play games forever!
Dialogue||Why is he so silly?
Dialogue||I don't know Lester.
Dialogue||I don't know, he's just silly! He's good at games and playing, too.
Dialogue||You don't? You should be friends! He's a real guard, with a sword and everything.
Dialogue||Hey, farmer. I'm having a great cardio day. Here's a cardio tip for you - have a kid!
Dialogue||It's amazing that you stay so positive these days.
Dialogue||In your experience, what's the hardest thing about being a mom?
Dialogue||Do you mean because Sun Haven is hurting a little bit right now?
Dialogue||You know, I could waste my energy being worried about it if I wanted to, but I don't see any point in that. So I focus on other things, like my job and family.
Dialogue||The hardest thing? Hm, let me think... I guess it's not knowing what kind of trouble goes on while I'm gone during the day.
Dialogue||Giuseppe is great at being a dad, but not always the best at being an adult.
Dialogue||It's important to focus on what makes you happy.
Dialogue||It sounds like you're ignoring reality.
Dialogue||Exactly. Stressing out about the bad stuff never helped anyone.
Dialogue||Call it what you want, farmer. We all have to get by somehow.
Dialogue||Does that get tiresome?
Dialogue||At least he makes Topi happy, right?
Dialogue||Sure, but it's also why I love him. He reminds me that I'm allowed to have fun, too.
Dialogue||When it comes down to it, that's all that really matters... but it helps that he watches Topi when I take my afternoon nap, too.
Dialogue||Sometimes I think that if I wasn't a witch, I'd have been a farmer like you.
Dialogue||"Lynn, the farmer's wife", oh, I still get giddy when I say it!
Dialogue||I married the pretty blacksmith.
Dialogue||Did you ever think you'd marry a farmer?
Dialogue||Farmer and blacksmith really seem to fit together, don't they? That has to settle it, it was fate that we met each other, XX!
Dialogue||I honestly didn't know who I'd marry. I never thought I'd leave home, really. Back in my village, it's customary for the women to choose their husbands and propose marriage.
Dialogue||I never saw myself feeling confident enough to do something like that, but before you proposed, I secretly chose you!
Dialogue||To myself, anyways. So I guess I sort of adhered to traditon?
Dialogue||I really don't think it was fate.
Dialogue||Whatever it was, it brought you to me.
Dialogue||...Yeah, I guess it's silly to think it was 'fate'. But I'm still glad we met on that train.
Dialogue||And me to you, XX. Oh, now I'm feeling all giddy again...
Dialogue||You "secretly" chose me? You're so adorable.
Dialogue||You should've proposed to me!
Dialogue||Hey, you ended up proposing, didn't you? Good thing too, because I'm not sure I would have made a mess of it if I tried to!
Dialogue||My back's been aching the last couple of days. Makes bending down a real pain!
Dialogue||Have you been to the hospital for it yet?
Dialogue||You should take it a little easier on yourself.
Dialogue||Eh, I didn't really want to trouble anyone... I think it's fine, really. It's just a little crick in the back, you know?
Dialogue||Yeah, you're right, XX. I should, but I've gotten so many orders lately. People in Sun Haven really depend on me, so I have a real hard time telling anyone "no".
Dialogue||Go see a doctor, Liam.
Dialogue||Doctors like Wornhardt are here to help, you should get checked out.
Dialogue||I just don't want to be a bother is all... oh, alright, XX. I'll go make an appointment...
Dialogue||It's okay if you can't always help everyone.
Dialogue||You have to learn to turn people down.
Dialogue||I know, XX. I just have a really hard time feeling like I'm letting someone down, especially when they need me for something.
Dialogue||This is a problem I'm really trying to work on, so thanks for being supportive.
Dialogue||Something like that is just too hard for me. Look, can we forget I said anything, please? I'll just put up with the extra work. It's fine, really.
Dialogue||So Withergate's wannabe citizen returns to pester the prince. Don't you know how busy I am?
Dialogue||Hopefully you have time to relax in your daily work as prince.
Dialogue||The responsibilities of a prince must be a burden.
Dialogue||Unsurprisingly, you continue to show your ignorance. I work when I want and take what free time I please, as a prince should.
Dialogue||I consider them a privilege. That's the differences between us - we're simply cut from a different cloth.
Dialogue||I can only imagine what the prince does with his free time.
Dialogue||I envy you, my prince.
Dialogue||What I enjoy more than anything is observing my citizens. Sometimes I walk through my streets and give my goodwill to the loyalists. It's important to maintain my presence as prince.
Dialogue||We aren't so different.
Dialogue||I long to understand the world you live in.
Dialogue||Brash fool... The dirt on my heels has seen greater luxury than you will in your entire life.
Dialogue||Perhaps you will get a taste of my world one day. If you work hard and earn your place at my table.
Dialogue||Lately, I've been inspired to learn all sorts of new things!
Dialogue||What are you learning about now?
Dialogue||How do you find time to learn so much stuff?
Dialogue||Anne had a set of these curious cards. She told me that witches in the Western Region are crazy about them right now. They're called "tarot cards."
Dialogue||I can learn to divine fate with them, similar to my tea leaves.
Dialogue||If I really want to do something, I let nothing stop me. It's important for me to make room in my life for new passions, you know.
Dialogue||Do you really need to learn more magic?
Dialogue||You're so curious, I love it.
Dialogue||Do I <i>need</i> to? Maybe I don't, but that doesn't mean I don't want to. I thought you'd be excited to hear what I was up to, but I guess not.
Dialogue||Pretty soon I'll learn all the cards, and then I'll divine our future with them! It'll be so much fun.
Dialogue||But you're so busy, how do you do it?
Dialogue||You sound even busier than I am.
Dialogue||Hey, I'm a pretty quick learner! And if I get my work done a few minutes faster every day, then it really adds up.
Dialogue||I want to live every day to the fullest. If there's time to spare, I want to spend it either learning something new, or with you!
Dialogue||XX, my sweet. You're radiant as ever in tonight's darkness.
Dialogue||I never knew you to be so sweet!
Dialogue||It's time I asked... is there a story behind your sword?
Dialogue||I put on a strong front for the people, as a prince must. But you're not "people" XX. I want to be authentic with you.
Dialogue||This sword... Yes indeed, but I don't know how you'll feel about it.
Dialogue||When Demons reach the end of their life, their bodies become as stone. The stone is different for each Demon, but stronger demons make harder stone.
Dialogue||When my grandfather passed, his last wish was to continue serving his people. Then he became a hard, shining red stone almost like glass.
Dialogue||We forged my grandfather into this sword to honor his last wish. He is always with me, as my protector.
Dialogue||I like this authentic version of you.
Dialogue||What if everyone in Withergate saw you like this?
Dialogue||Of course you do! But don't go and spread rumors about me. I need to maintain my public presence, after all.
Dialogue||Don't go and spread rumors about me. I need to maintain my public presence, after all.
Dialogue||Besides, nobody would believe you anyway. And if they did, I would lock them up.
Dialogue||Wasn't there a less creepy way to honor him?
Dialogue||That's a beautiful way to honor him.
Dialogue||If you think that's creepy, then don't bother asking what we did with Grandmother.
Dialogue||I think so, too. In fact, I want the same thing for myself one day. One day in the far, far future of course.
Dialogue||Sun Haven is such a pleasant little town. It's unbelievable that some people are scared to travel here.
Dialogue||Are you worried about the rumors?
Dialogue||How long do you think you'll stay here, Wornhardt?
Dialogue||Ah yes, Withergate, land of monsters, city of the underbelly... I don't know about any of that, but the idea of a monster attack is worrying even if it's unlikely.
Dialogue||I haven't thought about it too much, but as long as I'm happy then I don't see any reason to leave.
Dialogue||It's a good thing we have you in town, just in case.
Dialogue||I don't think it will come to that.
Dialogue||Right, it's a good thing... But I hope it doesn't come to that. I moved to Sun Haven to avoid that kind of action.
Dialogue||Neither do I, but there is this little voice in the back of my head that keeps reminding me of things like that, things that worry me. I've been trying to ignore that voice for a long time.
Dialogue||It's important to let yourself be happy.
Dialogue||So you'll just abandon Sun Haven as soon as you're unhappy with it?
Dialogue||I agree. We should enjoy the happy little things while they're here with us.
Dialogue||I like chatting with you, XX. For some reason, the conversation just flows.
Dialogue||That's not what I said, XX. There's no need to get worked up. Why don't you take a few breaths and relax?
Dialogue||Isn't your name XX? So good to meet you, I'm Catherine. I own the farming store here.
Dialogue||That's right - wait, how did you know my name?
Dialogue||Oh, don't you know? I'm surprised you can't tell. I'm a witch! It wasn't hard to divine the name of our new farmer.
Dialogue||A friend like you is great to have, XX. Not many other people really understand me.
Dialogue||In my whole life here, I've never seen the town so very very quiet as this last year.
Dialogue||Are you worried about the rumors going around?
Dialogue||What was it like growing up here?
Dialogue||You're talking about Withergate, nya? A city of monsters sounds bad! But maybe they're nice monsters? I think it's scary not to know!
Dialogue||Sun Haven has always been fun for me to explore, nya. There's lots of trees to climb, you know. Perfect for a growing kitty, nya nya!
Dialogue||One time I got stuck and Nathaniel had to come save me, teehee!
Dialogue||You don't need to be scared of rumors.
Dialogue||I'll protect you, Kitty!
Dialogue||Maybe... but I can't help but be on guard.
Dialogue||Nya!! Thank you, XX! You're such a brave friend!
Dialogue||Sun Haven wouldn't be the same without you, Kitty.
Dialogue||It sounds like you've been causing trouble your whole life.
Dialogue||Ah!! You're too nice, nya! You make Sun Haven even better than it was before, too.
Dialogue||Trouble? Kitty? Nyaaan...
Dialogue||I've been learning how to read palms. It's a little tricky, but also very fun!
Dialogue||I didn't know a palm could be read.
Dialogue||Why learn to read palms?
Dialogue||Well, you don't read them like you read a book. It's more about tracing both the physical shape of your palm and the aura that flows through it.
Dialogue||It's said that a hand can tell you a lot about a person, after all. Their past and their future.
Dialogue||It interests me, is all. Besides, it may be useful someday to someone. Helping someone out in the future is a good a reason as any, I think.
Dialogue||Do you worry about the future often?
Dialogue||Do you think about the past often?
Dialogue||I don't think there's any good in worrying about the future too much, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't think about it.
Dialogue||I want to use the time I have in the present to make sure everyone I care about is comfortable in the years to come. Maybe palms can help me!
Dialogue||I don't think it's helpful to dwell on the past very much, but who we were in the past is still really important. I wouldn't be the same person if it wasn't for the past I had.
Dialogue||I'm sure most people feel the same. So it's good to rediscover your past once in a while.
Dialogue||That sounds pointless.
Dialogue||The world needs more people who think like you!
Dialogue||Maybe it sounds "pointless" to you, but it's invigorating for me. Everyone is different. You know that, right?
Dialogue||Hehe. It does, but then I wouldn't be so unique! I'm just kidding, it would be great if more people felt the same.
Dialogue||Hi, stranger!
Dialogue||Are you a farmer? Magic Red Lady visited yesterday and said a farmer was coming.
Dialogue||That's right, I'm a farmer. My name is XX, what's yours?
Dialogue||My name is XX... Hehe, no it's not - I'm Pod!
Dialogue||At this point, there's not much about me you don't know. It's a funny thing, getting to know so much about a person.
Dialogue||I can find something new about you - what's the most exciting thing you've done?
Dialogue||What's so funny about getting to know someone, anyway?
Dialogue||Heh, you're good at this relationship business!
Dialogue||Okay, there was one time when I won a talent show in the Eastern Region. I don't normally go for stuff like that, but there was a cash prize and I happen to have the voice of a siren.
Dialogue||What, can't you imagine me on stage?
Dialogue||Not funny like a joke or Nathaniel's face or anything. I guess I'm saying it's... unfamiliar. In a good way. A fun way.
Dialogue||I can see it - you're already a complete showstopper!
Dialogue||You don't strike me as much of a performer.
Dialogue||You've got that right! Maybe one day I'll find a stage to sing on again.
Dialogue||For your information, I got a standing ovation when I was done singing.
Dialogue||I'm surprised, you're usually so confident.
Dialogue||It will feel familiar soon.
Dialogue||Make no mistake, I'll always be sure of myself. It's how I grew up, remember?
Dialogue||But even I can admit when I'm in uncharted waters. That's what our relationship feels like to me - an unpredictable adventure.
Dialogue||Even I can admit when I'm in uncharted waters, XX. That's what our relationship feels like to me - an unpredictable adventure.
Dialogue||I love my ears, but I wish I had whiskers too. What, you don't?
Dialogue||Not that it's a real surprise, but people are always buying all the prettiest plants I sell. But really, some of the most useful plants are often the least pretty.
Dialogue||Plants can be complicated, right?
Dialogue||You must be good at seeing value in everything.
Dialogue||True. It might be a very complicated subject, but I think it's still a very fascinating one. Some plants and herbs are useful for witchcraft, some are useful for everyday things.
Dialogue||Most are useful for both, in different ways.
Dialogue||It's not that I expect everyone to know as much about plants as I do, it's just sort of sad.
Dialogue||Stinkwort is perfect for getting stains out of anything, but it smells funky and looks dull, so no one ever buys any.
Dialogue||I think there's value to everything, you just have to know where to look.
Dialogue||I will never doubt your knowledge of all things green.
Dialogue||How did you learn so much about plants?
Dialogue||I don't know if you're poking fun of me, but I agree! Never doubt me, hehe.
Dialogue||Well, what began as a childish hobby ended up blossoming into a much more serious interest. I've learned from experience and reading botany texts. Lots of both.
Dialogue||Oh, and the "blossoming" pun was intended!
Dialogue||If it isn't selling, then maybe you should get rid of it.
Dialogue||Maybe you could teach people about the uses of different plants?
Dialogue||If I didn't even offer it, then that would just make the problem worse. Then no one would <i>ever</i> know what value Stinkwort has.
Dialogue||I get where you're coming from on a business side of things, but that just isn't me.
Dialogue||"That's actually a really great idea, XX. I'm a little too busy for that, but I know Emmett always has time.
Dialogue||He's not as well versed as me, but he could swing it! I'll have to talk about adding it into his schedule.
Dialogue||XX! For a moment I forgot I was awake. Sometimes I see you in my dreams.
Dialogue||You've dreamed about me?
Dialogue||Don't read into this, but what would be a good gift if I wanted to surprise you?
Dialogue||Sometimes... actually, quite often. I hope that doesn't make you uncomfortable. They're just silly dreams, anyway.
Dialogue||Oh, XX, don't tease me. I'd love to just spend time with you. I don't need any fancy gifts.
Dialogue||I think it's flattering.
Dialogue||It is a bit weird...
Dialogue||Oh thank goodness - I was worried you'd think I was being a creep!
Dialogue||I was worried you would feel that way. I'm sorry XX, but I can't control what happens in my dreams.
Dialogue||Aw, come on!
Dialogue||Oh well, at least I tried.
Dialogue||All right, let me think... I suppose I have been looking for a new decoration to go in my home. I would love a new houseplant!
Dialogue||You're so full of surprises, XX. I think I know every little detail about you and then you come back with another surprise.
Dialogue||Ah, XX. It is good to have you in my company.
Dialogue||Withergate's future is steeped in glory, and we shall sit at the top!
Dialogue||Hey there, XX. You must do a bit of cooking, right? I always wondered, what do you think of my bread oven? Caroline is the real star of the bakery!
Dialogue||Your bread oven has a name?
Dialogue||How many loaves of bread do you bake in a single day?
Dialogue||I don't know why the oven has a name, but when I bought the bakery way back when, I found the name "Caroline" etched into the brickwork on the inside of the oven.
Dialogue||I've just referred to the oven that way ever since. You don't think that's silly, do you?
Dialogue||For a long while it seemed like I didn't need to do much more than a dozen loaves a day. But now I'm selling thrice that, at least!
Dialogue||Honestly it's real tough to keep up with the demand sometimes.
Dialogue||That's a very charming story.
Dialogue||It's a little strange to give your bread oven a name.
Dialogue||That's a relief! I was worried you were going to think I was weird or something... I'm glad you liked the story.
Dialogue||Oh... you were actually the first person I had told this to, besides Emma and Elizabeth. Maybe I should stop calling my oven by name...
Dialogue||At least you make plenty enough for your sisters.
Dialogue||It must be a sign of Sun Haven turning around.
Dialogue||Those two are why I get out of bed every morning, I don't know if I could handle all this work if not for them.
Dialogue||Oh, I'm sorry, XX. I'm not trying to dump all of my complaints on you. We should talk about something else...
Dialogue||I think so, too. I'm glad the town is turning around, but the extra orders have gotten really exhausting.
Dialogue||Hey hun, how's your work been?
Dialogue||I've been keeping myself busy. How about you?
Dialogue||What kind of energies do you read in our marriage?
Dialogue||I was a little worried that married life would cut into my work.
Dialogue||But honestly, nothing's really changed. I never thought marriage would be so... comfortable. I love it!
Dialogue||Oh, it's difficult to explain. But when it comes to how I interpret auras and energy, it takes time to get a clear reading.
Dialogue||But that's okay. You and I can take all the time in the world.
Dialogue||You're married, but you still have a life of your own.
Dialogue||You should focus on our relationship more.
Dialogue||Oh believe me, I know that! But you're so compatible with me XX, I can't believe how lucky I am. We truly were made for each other, weren't we?
Dialogue||I... truly hope that isn't how you feel, XX. I need our relationship to be liberating, not confining.
Dialogue||I'd be happy to wait with you forever, if that's what it takes.
Dialogue||Well I'm reading energies right now that say you're super cute!
Dialogue||Hehe, of course you'd say something sappy like that!
Dialogue||Well if it isn't one of my favorite people in Sun Haven!
Dialogue||Actually, I say that for a lot of customers. But for you it's kind of true!
Dialogue||Wait, it looks like you're hiding something...
Dialogue||When are you off work? I was thinking I could see you after.
Dialogue||Aw, you caught me! All right XX, listen up.
Dialogue||The first time I ever had enough money to buy myself something nice - just for fun, not like food or shelter - I bought myself pearl earrings.
Dialogue||This is one of the two earrings. I'm keeping the other, but I want you to have this one. You're becoming a good friend and I guess I want to show you that it means something to me.
Dialogue||But you better not lose this! Just stick it in your pocket or something, as long as it's safe.
Dialogue||Oh, is that what you were thinking? Well I'm always open for business, but I close my cart around 4.
Dialogue||Are you sure? It sounds important.
Dialogue||I'd be happy to keep it for you.
Dialogue||Keep it safe like I said, okay? It's lucky, you know!
Dialogue||Let's call it a date!
Dialogue||Actually, forget about it.
Dialogue||Oh, how unusually forward of you... I could get used to that!
Dialogue||Sure, let's give it a shot. Why not! Come by my cart tomorrow at 4:00 pm.
Dialogue||Oh? If you say so, XX.
Dialogue||Oh hi there, XX. I hope your day is going well.
Dialogue||Me? My arms are sore today.
Dialogue||Don't you get tired of working so hard?
Dialogue||What made you want to be a blacksmith?
Dialogue||Sure I do. I try not to complain though. It's like Solon says, "Every breath goes into the forge."
Dialogue||At least I'm learning a lot. In the end, I just want my family to be proud of me.
Dialogue||In the Eastern Region, women are the blacksmiths. My mother and grandmother supported our whole family with smithing, so I guess you could say it's in my blood.
Dialogue||Your work should be for yourself, not for other people.
Dialogue||You'll make your family proud, I know it.
Dialogue||In my village, the only people that think that way don't have any friends or family.
Dialogue||Aw, thank you XX. I'll have to make you some fantastic armor one day!
Dialogue||Tradition is nice, but how do you know if this is what you really want?
Dialogue||Tradition is important. It's good that you're representing your culture.
Dialogue||When I'm forging steel, I feel connected to something bigger than myself. It's too bad you don't share that feeling or else I'm sure you'd understand.
Dialogue||When I'm forging steel, I feel connected to something bigger than myself. I'm glad you understand that kind of connection, too.
Dialogue||Take a stroll through my wheat field sometime, it's really peaceful. Just don't trample the wheat, please.
Dialogue||I just met a couple of travelers from the Northern Region. The north sounds so cold... I'm really glad it's warm here!
Dialogue||Are you from Sun Haven, or did you move here?
Dialogue||Have you traveled much outside of Sun Haven?
Dialogue||All of my siblings and I were born right here in Sun Haven. All eight of us!
Dialogue||The rest of my litter moved to other cities, but I just couldn't leave.
Dialogue||Not really. I went on vacation with my family once to the far west. It was very industrious and everyone seemed so busy. Honestly, I didn't love it.
Dialogue||What's keeping you here?
Dialogue||You love Sun Haven that much?
Dialogue||Hm... You know, I just see a future for myself here. And I don't mean literally, like in a crystal ball - I prefer tea leaves for fortune telling, anyway.
Dialogue||Oops, I'm rambling. To put it simply, I want to raise a family here. Simple as that!
Dialogue||Don't sound so surprised! I'm sure you'll agree once you get to know everyone. The people really make this town special.
Dialogue||If you thought the big city was boring, that's on you.
Dialogue||I don't see why anyone would want to live that way.
Dialogue||XX, life is only as boring as you make it. Or, right now, life is as annoying as you make it.
Dialogue||I'm saying that you're annoying me.
Dialogue||I completely agree! A busy town is fun, but at least give me some trees to sit under on a hot day.
Dialogue||Can you see yourself in my armor? I was polishing it all night!
Dialogue||When I'm older, I'm going to lead the army just like Nathaniel!
Dialogue||Hi hi, XX! Do you have a busy day? Don't let it get you down!
Dialogue||How do you stay so happy all the time?
Dialogue||I'm never sad with you around, Kitty!
Dialogue||Just look around XX, the whole world is happy, nya! Just look at the sunshine and flowers. They're so bright and joyful, I just copy them!
Dialogue||Aw! Same same, XX! Since we became two peas in a pod, everything has been happier. I'm very very grateful to have you with me!
Dialogue||That doesn't make any sense.
Dialogue||Does that make you a... copycat?
Dialogue||I don't know how else to explain to you, XX. That's all there is to it! If you don't understand, then Kitty can't help.
Dialogue||Heehee, XX! I can't believe I never thought of that - I'm a real copycat. How funny, nya nya!
Dialogue||I'm glad you're happier now, Kitty!
Dialogue||You make me happier, too!
Dialogue||I promise to always be happy with you, XX. And Kitty doesn't break promises!
Dialogue||You are welcome in Withergate, but that can change if you ever think of crossing us.
Dialogue||Hey there, XX! Buying anything today, or just looking for a chat?
Dialogue||You're always out for a sale, huh? How did you get started as a merchant?
Dialogue||Do you plan to stay in Sun Haven long?
Dialogue||Let's just say I've been supporting myself for a long time. I learned the ins and outs of trade to survive from a young age.
Dialogue||I'm living proof that survival is for the fittest!
Dialogue||If business doesn't pick up someday soon, I might have to move on. Sun Haven has been good to me though. I'm really pulling for this town.
Dialogue||That sounds hard on your own. Don't be afraid to lean on others for help.
Dialogue||That's actually inspiring, you're a real-life success story.
Dialogue||I didn't ask for your opinion, so keep your thoughts to yourself.
Dialogue||I know I am, but it's nice to hear it out loud!
Dialogue||Hold on, don't go thinking that compliments will get you a discount. They won't.
Dialogue||If I didn't know better, I'd say you like this town for more than its profitability.
Dialogue||I hope you're able to stick around.
Dialogue||Don't get me wrong, profit is my North Star. But, okay, there's part of me that likes Sun Haven for what it is.
Dialogue||Or maybe making friends is part of my marketing strategy - who knows!
Dialogue||Me too, XX. Packing everything up and moving is such a hassle for me, not to mention expensive.
Dialogue||No matter how well I secure the cart, something always comes loose and makes a huge mess...
Dialogue||You reek of inferiority.
Dialogue||Feeling well today? It looks like you got good sleep last night.
Dialogue||I dreamed I was flying with dragon's wings. Did you dream?
Dialogue||You always notice me, Jun. I'm lucky to have someone as mindful as you.
Dialogue||Dragon wings? Mine definitely wasn't as adventurous as yours.
Dialogue||In my dream I was a cloud in the sky watching all the people in town below. I could even see into their homes, like dollhouses. It was strange, but also quite unique.
Dialogue||XX, I noticed you right away. How could I not? I feel like the lucky one here!
Dialogue||Yeah, that's not quite so adventurous.
Dialogue||That sounds kind of fun!
Dialogue||Maybe next time I'll join you in the sky with dragon's wings. One can only hope!
Dialogue||You think so? Part of me thinks so too. It's too bad we aren't clouds in the sky, XX.
Dialogue||Strange, I didn't really notice you until we started talking.
Dialogue||I noticed you on my first day here, too.
Dialogue||Oh, huh. Not even once? That's a little disappointing...
Dialogue||Is that true? So we were sneaking glances at each other from the very beginning? That's too cute!
Dialogue||Do you know I almost learned to farm, too? I read about it in a book!
Dialogue||Can you tell me what crops I should plant, Kitty?
Dialogue||What kind of books do you like to read?
Dialogue||Ooh, my choice? I wish fish grew on trees but hm... Ooh or you should plant lettuce for Kitty!
Dialogue||Fairy Tales! My favorite one is about a cat who turns into a human princess. I'm sure you can guess why, teehee!
Dialogue||Lettuce it is!
Dialogue||I don't think lettuce is a good idea.
Dialogue||Yay! I know the general store has lettuce seeds, nya. Bring me some when it's grown!
Dialogue||No no? Well you would know, XX, since you're the real farmer.
Dialogue||Aren't fairytales meant for children?
Dialogue||That does sound like you, Kitty!
Dialogue||Fairytales are for everyone, nyan. Don't you like to use your imagination?
Dialogue||Aw, you think Kitty's a princess?? Thank you, XX!
Dialogue||I don't remember my dream last night, but I woke up feeling entirely at peace. I wonder what was going on in my head!
Dialogue||Don't you usually wake up feeling that way?
Dialogue||I bet I know what you were dreaming about.
Dialogue||People are often surprised to learn this, but I'm actually a rather restless sleeper. It's why a quiet morning routine is important to start my day.
Dialogue||Oh, stop you. I already know what you're going to say - you!
Dialogue||I appreciate quiet in the morning too.
Dialogue||I like to get straight to work when I wake up.
Dialogue||That makes sense. We're kindred spirits, you and I.
Dialogue||Ah, that makes sense. Farming is busy work, after all. But I'm afraid I wouldn't be mentally prepared for the day if I went straight to work.
Dialogue||Actually, I was going to say the sunset over the farm.
Dialogue||Of course it was me!
Dialogue||Oh! That's a good guess, actually. It almost feels right, too.
Dialogue||Oh well, I guess I'll never know. But now I'm in the mood to watch tonight's sunset!
Dialogue||You know XX, I do have other interests outside of you. However... you're probably right.
Dialogue||You've demonstrated that even someone of the lowest class can learn respect. You may ask questions of me freely from now on, outsider. But don't get cocky.
Dialogue||Who in town do you trust the most?
Dialogue||I've got to know... What does the prince like to eat for dessert?
Dialogue||Certainly, it's Xyla. I've worked with her closely over years. What's more, I'm the reason she lives here in the first place.
Dialogue||Having found her at a low point and raising her into glory... I know her loyalty is never in question.
Dialogue||Since I was little, our chef has made me an excellent moon cream pie. I'm sure you wouldn't stand it. It is an acquired taste.
Dialogue||One day, I'll earn your trust the same way.
Dialogue||What if she's just keeping up an act?
Dialogue||If I will it, certainly. But only if I will it.
Dialogue||If you think she could fool ME... the only fool here is you.
Dialogue||It sounds great!
Dialogue||It sounds weird.
Dialogue||Some of the street vendors in Withergate serve a lesser version of it, but nobody makes it like the royal family's chef.
Dialogue||I wouldn't expect an unrefined pallet to enjoy it.
Dialogue||Look at you, a successful farmer, and Blessed too! You've come a long way since you stepped off that train.
Dialogue||I didn't expect to find someone like you, XX.
Dialogue||I'm really curious to see how your farm turns out. That old land has needed a caretaker for years now.
Dialogue||Once I saw a lady dive into the ocean and disappear and I think she had a fish tail. No, really!
Dialogue||XX, great to see you again!
Dialogue||If you have the time, I'd love to check in with you. I am the town's counselor, after all.
Dialogue||Sure, let's check in!
Dialogue||What do you do as a counselor?
Dialogue||How are you settling in, XX?
Dialogue||Simply put, I talk to people about their problems. If you're feeling overwhelmed, come find me. Everybody needs someone to talk to.
Dialogue||I've been settling in well.
Dialogue||Sometimes I get lost around here.
Dialogue||That's really good to hear, XX. You already look much more comfortable than when you first showed up.
Dialogue||I would love to help, but... I'm terrible at giving directions.
Dialogue||People need to learn to deal with their own problems.
Dialogue||This town is lucky to have someone like you in it.
Dialogue||I'm surprised to hear you say something like that.
Dialogue||Thanks, XX. I knew you were a kind person.
Dialogue||XX, have you considered a change of profession? You are too fine a person to be digging in dirt.
Dialogue||You never told me, what kind of work do you do with your father?
Dialogue||If you weren't royalty, what job do you think you would have?
Dialogue||Look, I'm going to tell you something that you have to keep quiet. If I learn that you've spoken of this to anyone, you can consider yourself exiled from Withergate.
Dialogue||... My father does very little work. He once worked tirelessly, but now that Withergate is finished, he sits back and lets me handle everything. He calls it training. I find it infuriating.
Dialogue||Hm... That's something I've never pondered. Who knows? You're a farmer, and one with class. Perhaps I could have been like you.
Dialogue||You can trust me to keep this quiet.
Dialogue||That doesn't seem fair at all.
Dialogue||I know, XX, or else I wouldn't have spoken about it in the first place.
Dialogue||Fairness doesn't matter. He is both my father and my king. While he holds the throne, I have to respect him as both.
Dialogue||A farmer? I don't see it.
Dialogue||You would have done well for yourself!
Dialogue||Oh, you think yourself so competent? I'm certain I can till land and raise crops just as well as any farmer - better, even!
Dialogue||Then again, a farmer's life rather lacks dignity. Perhaps a merchant, instead. Surely, I would have become a wealthy owner of several successful shops.
Dialogue||Is someone there? I can barely see out of this thing...
Dialogue||It's good you're here. It has been a day of boredom in the castle.
Dialogue||What's it like living in the castle?
Dialogue||Have you ever tried living in sunlight?
Dialogue||Withergate Castle is the safest place in the world. It is comfortable and luxurious, certainly, but there was a time when it was the difference between life or death for demons.
Dialogue||XX... I've gathered a small fondness for you, but a question like that is an insult.
Dialogue||Demons were forced to live in sunlight for ages. Ages of blindness and anguish. Only in this eternal night have we found peace.
Dialogue||How long ago was it built?
Dialogue||I'm glad you had the castle. Otherwise, Withergate may not have been made.
Dialogue||My grandfather pulled the castle from the ground with his magic one hundred years ago, with the help of my father and me. I pride myself on having been there that day. When I look at the castle, I still feel that pride.
Dialogue||I didn't realize you were so sensitive, Darius.
Dialogue||I should have known better.
Dialogue||You're getting too comfortable with me., XX. If you don't correct yourself, I will be forced to make the correction.
Dialogue||Little XX... You're quick to regain my good graces. I seem to be developing a soft spot for you.
Dialogue||Submit to your prince.
Dialogue||Are my clothes dirty, XX? I just came back from the beach. It's fun digging in the sand!
Dialogue||When no one's looking, I hide snacks in my pants. But not in the pockets, 'cause that's what they expect.
Dialogue||Love you, sweetie!
Dialogue||The tavern has some good food, but it never tastes quite as fresh as I'd like.
Dialogue||Oh, don't mention that to Mari!
Dialogue||Hm? XX, you look perplexed. If someone has wronged you, I will have the guards on them in moments!
Dialogue||It's nothing like that. I'm just thinking about our future.
Dialogue||Ah, our future. I cannot wait, XX! The city will be ours to share. With your charm and my ferocity, certainly we will go down in history as great leaders.
Dialogue||XX, you little fool. I am quite happy with you. In fact, one day I will be Withergate's king and I want you beside me on the throne.
Dialogue||You really think I'll be a good leader?
Dialogue||As long as we're together, then I don't care where we are.
Dialogue||You're already a leader, XX. I can see it in you. If you can't see it then you're not looking with your eyes, because it is clear as the moon to me.
Dialogue||A silly thing to say, don't you think? Surely we would never forsake our power and responsibility to Withergate.
Dialogue||We can stay together right here, XX.
Dialogue||There's only one way to make that happen.
Dialogue||Is that what's best for us?
Dialogue||Indeed, now you're catching on! Heheh, I mean that I am ready for you whenever you're ready for me. And don't worry about the ring - any kind will do, so long as it's from you.
Dialogue||Of course it is. Do you doubt my word, XX? Or perhaps, you don't feel the way I do.
Dialogue||Hey XX, taking a break from farming? It's healthy to have interests outside of work.
Dialogue||I was wondering, if you weren't a soldier then what job would you want?
Dialogue||Do you have a hobby outside of work?
Dialogue||That's a good question. I would still want to help people somehow, that's for sure. I think I'd like building houses.
Dialogue||I don't know if it counts as a hobby, but I'm pretty good at skipping stones across the lake.
Dialogue||There's something about it that's mesmerizing. It should sink, but it skips instead. It's like a little miracle!
Dialogue||Does that make any sense, or am I just talking nonsense?
Dialogue||That's a surprising choice.
Dialogue||That makes perfect sense for you!
Dialogue||You think so? I did love making forts in the woods when I was a kid. At least, back when there was still some forested land left in the Great City. Now the Great City is all roads.
Dialogue||You think so? I did love making forts in the woods when I was a kid.
Dialogue||Now the Great City is all roads, so there's nowhere left to make forts.
Dialogue||It makes sense to me.
Dialogue||That does sound a little silly.
Dialogue||Oh yeah? Well don't get me wrong - I know it comes down to good hand-eye coordination. But I like to think that the rock actually skips because it refuses to sink.
Dialogue||Hey, I haven't told that to anyone!
Dialogue||Yeah, I know. I guess being a little silly just helps lift my spirits, sometimes.
Dialogue||My sisters are really interested in you - um, by that I mean farmers. They've never seen food grow before.
Dialogue||Is your farm quiet at night? I'd love to relax in the field with you sometime.
Dialogue||Once we started dating, I began planning a cake for our anniversary. I'm just telling you so I won't forget to finish!
Dialogue||What do you think of my necklace? I want people to think I look rich, but not too rich. I think I nailed it!
Dialogue||Who do you actually like to hang out with in Sun Haven, anyway?
Dialogue||You look like a queen in a storybook! Do you ever read stories like that?
Dialogue||I don't know if I really "hang out" with anyone, but I've had a few good conversations with the doctor. Wornhardt is a good man, even if he doesn't know it.
Dialogue||I don't read a lot of book with characters in them. I mostly like to read books about places.
Dialogue||It started as a way to get to know different cities that I was traveling to but, believe it or not, I actually enjoy it now! I know, sounds boring, huh?
Dialogue||Well, there's a lot of history out there. And some of it is actually pretty fascinating!
Dialogue||You don't like to spend time with anyone here?
Dialogue||I'm not one to gossip, but he's still working through some stuff from his past. If you really want to know, go talk to him about it. But don't expect him to open up right away.
Dialogue||I see plenty of people at work all day. Then, I hit the tavern. There's always someone there to talk with.
Dialogue||Ronald and Mari run a good business, so I'll chat with them. Heck, they probably know me better than anyone - but you're a close second at this point!
Dialogue||Interesting! You must know things about a lot of different places.
Dialogue||That sounds... yeah, kind of boring.
Dialogue||Sure I do. Did you know this town began as an archeological dig site? Sun Haven has an interesting history. There's a book in the library that tells the whole story. You should read up on it!
Dialogue||Hey, you're the one who started a conversation about reading. That's on you. Anyway, a lot of the stuff I've learned has helped me in my business.
Dialogue||For instance, don't try to sell earmuffs in the Eastern Region. They have a folk tale where somebody wears earmuffs for too long and their soul suffocates... or something like that.
Dialogue||Enjoying the day? It's hard not to!
Dialogue||Liam takes real good care of us!
Dialogue||I will always be the flame that lights your path, XX.
Dialogue||Finally, someone I can talk to.
Dialogue||Guess what, XX... I finally saw Elios today!
Dialogue||How'd it go??
Dialogue||So do you feel like a "Sun Haven Local" now?
Dialogue||Elios is so huge! I knew he'd be big, but it was pretty unnerving to stand right in front of him.
Dialogue||But of course everything went fine. I didn't get any blessing, but he did tell me some really nice things.
Dialogue||I guess I know Sun Haven pretty well, but I still miss my home a lot. My family, too. I still don't quite know where I fit in here, to be honest.
Dialogue||Are you sad you weren't blessed?
Dialogue||What kinds of nice things?
Dialogue||Maybe a little disappointed... but honestly, I don't know if I could handle that right now. I already feel like I'm doing the most I can.
Dialogue||If I suddenly became Blessed, I don't know what I would do!
Dialogue||Mostly he was talking about how strong I am. Can you believe it - a dragon telling me that I'm strong! It was amazing!
Dialogue||You're fitting in fine!
Dialogue||I could tell you were having some trouble.
Dialogue||Aw, really? Maybe I'm just overthinking again. Thanks XX.
Dialogue||You can tell? Maybe I really am the odd girl out here.
Dialogue||I have to say, Sun Haven has really been turning itself around lately. I hear you're the one to thank for that, XX.
Dialogue||Do you have any favorite customers around town?
Dialogue||Do you plan to ever leave Sun Haven?
Dialogue||Not trying to butt into my clientele, are we? Hah, just kidding XX! My favorite customer is the one handing me cash.
Dialogue||But if you want a name, then it's Kitty. Whenever I have pet food, Kitty buys it all up right away!
Dialogue||You know, I think you asked me something similar when we first met. I think I said that if business didn't pick up, I'd have to leave.
Dialogue||That's still true, but I really don't see myself leaving town anytime soon. Sun Haven's really bounced back!
Dialogue||Kitty buys <i>all</i> your pet food?
Dialogue||She does have lots of mouths to feed.
Dialogue||She might be a bit of a goof, but the girl does own her own business, after all. Seems like she's doing well for herself, too.
Dialogue||True, but I've seen her open a bag of the stuff and start munching on it right away!
Dialogue||She's a real character, but she pays well so I'm not complaining.
Dialogue||Looks like you owe me one.
Dialogue||Good, Sun Haven wouldn't be the same without you.
Dialogue||Excuse me? Listen, <i>maybe</i> you've had something to do with Sun Haven's dramatic turnaround, but the only one I owe for my profit is me.
Dialogue||Nowhere is the same without me, XX! I'm a bit of an icon, if you haven't noticed.
Dialogue||I hear music each time we speak, XX. A lovely duet.
Dialogue||I polish my ring every night. Good metal needs to be taken care of.
Dialogue||Sunny days are always nice, but I still appreciate a good gloomy day now and again.
Dialogue||Does Sun Haven get many gloomy days?
Dialogue||What do you like to do on a gloomy day?
Dialogue||Not usually. It's a bit out of our weather pattern, if you haven't realized that yet. I guess as a farmer, you would prefer it to be perfect farming weather, more often than not!
Dialogue||Well, it's a perfect excuse to relax at home. I like to lay back and maybe focus on mind games or a picture puzzle.
Dialogue||If you try looking on the positive sides, then I believe you can find something good about almost any situation.
Dialogue||Sun Haven does seem to have predictable weather.
Dialogue||As long as the weather is fine for farming, I'm not bothered.
Dialogue||That's a good thing, though, isn't it? No big surprises must make your farming much easier.
Dialogue||Ah, if only everyone could be as laid back as you, XX. The world would be a better place.
Dialogue||You must be good at always seeing positive sides.
Dialogue||No way, I hate days that are gloomy.
Dialogue||It's a skill I've gotten very adept at, that's for sure. It all stems from not wanting to take any days for granted, no matter what they are.
Dialogue||I see. Not shocking, I suppose, as most people would probably agree with you. Still, I feel like you're missing out by not seeing the good in every day.
Dialogue||I'm a bit busy, but it's nice to see you.
Dialogue||Let's see, divide by six, carry the two... ugh, you're distracting me from my calculations, XX!
Dialogue||I wonder if Solon has plans for the smithery after he retires...
Dialogue||I've come to truly enjoy your presence, XX. Strange, since you're merely a farmer.
Dialogue||The more I get to know you, the more you already sound like a king.
Dialogue||You're truly an icon. I long to be more like you.
Dialogue||I hope that isn't surprise I hear in your voice. Don't forget who you're talking to. Royalty is in my blood.
Dialogue||The only way you could learn to be like me is by spending more time with me. Alone. Together.
Dialogue||Perhaps we should... engage in a private meeting?
Dialogue||Yeah, but your dad seems way more kingly than you.
Dialogue||My prince, I only meant that Withergate will be lucky to have you as king.
Dialogue||Keep talking like that and you will beg my forgiveness when I hold the throne. Forgiveness I will not give.
Dialogue||Indeed. If everyone here treats me with the same respect you show me, then my rule will be easy.
Dialogue||If it pleases you, my prince!
Dialogue||I see. Forget it, it was a foolish idea anyway.
Dialogue||Of course it would. Be in front of the apartment building tomorrow at 5:00 pm. Don't make me wait around, XX...
Dialogue||This morning I met a traveler from the East. From what they said, the Eastern Region sounds beautiful!
Dialogue||You don't plan to ever leave Sun Haven for good, right Kitty?
Dialogue||I haven't asked, have you traveled much outside of Sun Haven?
Dialogue||Actually, I never thought about it before... Sun Haven is such a comfy home, the thought of leaving is so so sad!
Dialogue||Yes yes, I've gone across the big bridge once! ... Well actually, only halfway. Nyaaan - it's too scary!
Dialogue||I can't imagine staying.
Dialogue||I'd love to stay here with you.
Dialogue||Oh no... I don't know if I can leave, XX. If you leave, I might not come with you, nyan!
Dialogue||Ah! XX, that's a nice thought, nya. It will be so much more fun sharing this town with my partner!
Dialogue||I could walk across with you one day.
Dialogue||Wait, you've never even been across the bridge?
Dialogue||You're so brave!! Let's do that one day, nya. In the meantime we can just chase butterflies in the grass, yeah yeah!
Dialogue||Don't tease me about it! There's a lot of water under that bridge, eep! No thanks!
Dialogue||One day, all my work will pay off.
Dialogue||Hi, farmer!
Dialogue||Who's your best friend in town?
Dialogue||Do you like school?
Dialogue||Topi is my best friend, but mama is my BEST best friend.
Dialogue||Yuck, no.
Dialogue||That might change when you grow up.
Dialogue||Your mama is lucky to have you!
Dialogue||Huh? I AM grown up!
Dialogue||We have fun playing games every day, hehe!
Dialogue||Isn't there something you like about it?
Dialogue||We never learn anything important like hiding or sandcastles.
Dialogue||I like Mister Jun. He makes us laugh and sometimes he even has candy if we do good!
Dialogue||I wanna learn how to fish! But Peter says he doesn't have time to teach me, and Rupert is always too shy to talk to Kitty, nya!
Dialogue||Rupert is shy around you?
Dialogue||Why do you want to learn how to fish?
Dialogue||Yup yup, whenever I try to talk to him he gets sooo embarrassed, he can't even be grumpy! I guess he never learned how to talk to cute girls, teehee!
Dialogue||Fish is my favorite food, you know that, right? Usually I just fish with my claws, but people using fishing rods catch sooo much more fish!!
Dialogue||It's against Kitty's better instinct as an Amari, but I must learn the secret of fishing rods, nya!
Dialogue||I wouldn't think he'd have such a soft side.
Dialogue||I guess Rupert likes cats.
Dialogue||Hehe. It's cute, but he still won't teach Kitty how to fish!
Dialogue||I couldn't picture you using a fishing rod.
Dialogue||If you ever learn, we could go fishing sometime!
Dialogue||Nyan?! Is it so strange Kitty wants to learn something new, XX?
Dialogue||Ohh, that's a fun idea! We could see who catches more fishies, and then Kitty could eat them all! Right?
Dialogue||Keep your eyes on the sea - she will tell you anything you need to know about the weather.
Dialogue||Ah, the outsider. If you're staying, then you may call me "My Prince." The pleasure is yours.
Dialogue||... Well?
Dialogue||So you're the prince of Withergate?
Dialogue||What exactly do you do here?
Dialogue||That should be obvious. Learn who you're speaking to before opening your mouth, peasant.
Dialogue||Do I look like an advisor to you? It's not my job to answer your questions.
Dialogue||Someone woke up on the wrong side of the bed this morning.
Dialogue||I beg forgiveness, my prince.
Dialogue||You don't seem to understand who you're addressing. Actually, I'll rephrase - you don't seem to understand how close I am to locking you in my dungeon.
Dialogue||That will do for now. Keep that up, and you might yet earn your place here.
Dialogue||I'm sorry, I didn't know.
Dialogue||Well if you're not an advisor then what is your job?
Dialogue||Consider yourself forgiven, but I can only accept so many of your mistakes.
Dialogue||Do you prefer a crowded jail cell or a solitary cage hanging from the ceiling? Oh nevermind - I'll surprise you.
Dialogue||I know everyone pretty well. It's easier getting to know people when you talk to them every day.
Dialogue||I got a letter the other day from my mother. She can't believe I married someone as incredible as you!
Dialogue||What's so hard to believe about you marrying me?
Dialogue||How's everyone doing back home, anyways?
Dialogue||Well, I never told you this, but when we first started getting a little serious, I wrote to my mother about you. At first she didn't seem to approve of you.
Dialogue||...But after hearing more about all the incredible things you've done, she really came around. I'd love it so much if you could meet one day in person.
Dialogue||Oh, everyone is getting by just well! They all say they miss me, but it's okay. They're never too far away, after all.
Dialogue||I'm glad I got her seal of approval.
Dialogue||Your mother seems really judgy.
Dialogue||She can be a bit old fashioned, but she always means well. She knows farming is dutiful and important, but she always envisioned me with someone "worthy."
Dialogue||I guess you're more than worthy for her taste, XX!
Dialogue||She can be... really old fashioned, yeah. But she means well. I hope you don't think she's too judgmental or anything.
Dialogue||How long does it take to get back to your home village?
Dialogue||You should visit them all.
Dialogue||Well, it's about two days by train, but that's only because it takes a day to travel from East Station to the Mountain Station.
Dialogue||The two train stations aren't connected by rails yet, but someday they will be. Then going right from Sun Haven to my village will be a single train ride!
Dialogue||We'll be able to visit all the time, and my mother will finally see why you're the one I married, no matter what she thinks!
Dialogue||That's a wonderful idea, but I could never visit them without bringing you! We're both a bit busy for that right now, though.
Dialogue||It's just two days of travel by train, but the railroad ends at the Eastern Station, so you have to travel on foot to the Montain Station to continue on to my village.
Dialogue||Someday, though, the railroads will be connected, and it'll be a straight shot from Sun Haven to my village!
Dialogue||I'm eager to rule with you by my side, one day. The future has never looked so dark!
Dialogue||Don't you mean bright?
Dialogue||Do you think I'll be welcomed by the citizens?
Dialogue||Hm? I said what I meant, XX! I wince at the thought of a bright future. Of course, I understand you live your life in the sunlight. But one day, you will join us in beautiful darkness.
Dialogue||You will be welcomed, I'll make sure of it. Anyone who dares criticise you will answer to me. And trust me, it only takes one strong example for a whole city to learn a lesson.
Dialogue||I can't wait for that day.
Dialogue||When do you think that day will come?
Dialogue||Neither can I, XX. My father has many years yet to rule, however. In the meantime, let us simply enjoy each other's company. And the power of a prince, of course.
Dialogue||My father has many years yet to rule, however. In the meantime, let us simply enjoy each other's company. And the power of a prince, of course.
Dialogue||That sounds almost wicked.
Dialogue||I can't wait until I can wield power like yours.
Dialogue||Yes, exactly... though I don't know why you say that like it's a bad thing.
Dialogue||Patience, my love. You have to learn how to use it first. Of course, your teacher is well-versed in the different uses of power.
Dialogue||Gotten to know everyone yet? We're not the biggest town on the map, but we sure do have spirit.
Dialogue||You're one of the most spirited people in town, Giuseppe.
Dialogue||What do you want Topi to be when he grows up?
Dialogue||Aw gee, you think? Heh, thanks farmer! It's not often I get a compliment out of the blue.
Dialogue||I try to stay positive. If ever I'm feeling down, I just channel that into my art.
Dialogue||I don't want him to be anything, specifically. It's up to him to figure that stuff out. As long as he does what he loves and supports his family, I'd be proud.
Dialogue||That sounds unhealthy.
Dialogue||That explains a lot about you.
Dialogue||Huh? But Jun told me it was good practice. Maybe I should check in with that guy.
Dialogue||Oh, don't get the wrong idea! Not <i>all</i> of my art comes from a dark place. Making art is more like a kind of meditation that calms me down. That's how Jun explained it to me, anyway.
Dialogue||Do you support your family?
Dialogue||You're a good role model for him, then.
Dialogue||Alright, let me rephrase it: so long as he does what he loves and at least marries someone who supports a family, I'd be proud.
Dialogue||I just want to be a grandpa one day!
Dialogue||Sure! Except for the, um, "support the family" part since Tonya brings in all the money.
Dialogue||If Topi is lucky enough to find someone who will support his dreams like Tonya does for me, then I'd be proud too. Really, I just want to be a grandpa one day!
Dialogue||I never learned to use a sword. I wonder if that's a problem?
Dialogue||You are Withergate's third most important person, but you will forever be the most important to me.
Dialogue||Hi Nathaniel - OH! I'm so sorry, XX! My brain just got mixed up for a moment there.
Dialogue||Hey, XX. I always have a moment for you.
Dialogue||Hey, XX. Have you gotten a chance to check out everything we sell at the smithy?
Dialogue||How is life in Sun Haven different from back home?
Dialogue||You seem to be adjusting to life in Sun Haven.
Dialogue||Oh, that's such a good question. Well, for starters, Sun Haven might be a pretty small town to you, but it's so much bigger than my home village!
Dialogue||The oddest thing in Sun Haven is that I make stuff that we turn around and sell. We make so much stuff every single day!
Dialogue||Back home, our village is so small that everything the blacksmiths make is meant for use by the villagers.
Dialogue||Oh, do you mean that? I'll be real honest, at first I actually wasn't sure if I'd ever really like living here. But the more the days go by, the more I think I'm really fitting in!
Dialogue||That sounds like a very tight-knit community.
Dialogue||Sounds awful, I bet you're glad you came to Sun Haven.
Dialogue||I suppose it is, isn't it? Our blacksmiths make some spare money from repairing or replacing parts, but mostly our little village shares what everyone makes.
Dialogue||It's very quaint, and Sun Haven is a lot different. But that doesn't mean I don't like it here! Sun Haven is so big and full of people and things, which is nice in its own way.
Dialogue||You think my home sounds awful? I'm sorry you think that, but I guess I understand why. They're two very different places, after all...
Dialogue||Sun Haven is better with you here.
Dialogue||You're going to do just fine, Lynn.
Dialogue||You mean even little ol' me makes a difference? That's very sweet of you to say, XX.
Dialogue||I want nothing more than to honor my heritage as a blacksmith by mastering all of the advanced techniques that Solon can teach me!
Dialogue||Thanks, XX. I'm really starting to think so, too.
Dialogue||You're so breathtaking.
Dialogue||Oh! Was that out loud or just in my head? Heh, nevermind!
Dialogue||I've heard that some people play music for their plants. It's supposed to help them grow. Putting music and plants together, I think it's a fantastic idea.
Dialogue||What kind of music would you play to a plant?
Dialogue||Do you think music really makes plants grow?
Dialogue||I don't know. I like to think that even music has an aura. The sounds and vibrations and rhythm, all of it has an energy to it. At least, that's what I think.
Dialogue||Maybe it depends on how I want the plant to grow. Noisy and loud for big and bountiful, quiet and reserved for soft and small? Who knows!
Dialogue||I don't know! Really, I just think it sounds like fun, even if it doesn't work. Besides, it's a good excuse to listen to a lot of music.
Dialogue||You seem to have lots of questions about the world.
Dialogue||That's a lot for me to get my head around.
Dialogue||Hehe, I'm sure it didn't take you this long to notice that, XX. Life is a mystery, and I like to figure it out.
Dialogue||It might seem pretty crazy, but that's how I like to think. Life is a mystery, and I like to figure it out.
Dialogue||Sounds like it might be a waste of time.
Dialogue||I can picture you playing your music to all your plants now.
Dialogue||Nothing is a waste of time if you enjoy doing it. Try to live without limiting yourself to things you think are "worth the time", XX. I certainly do.
Dialogue||It is kind of funny, huh? I told you it sounded fun! Now I'll have to try it sometime. It'll be interesting to see if it really works or not!
Dialogue||Of course, it's really the fun of it that counts, right?
Dialogue||The days have all been so beautiful lately. Rain or shine, I could get lost just gazing up at the clouds as they roll by.
Dialogue||Do you ever predict bad things in the future?
Dialogue||Don't you read clouds?
Dialogue||I predict all sorts of things. Sometimes good, sometimes bad. It's important to always take an unbiased stance towards any prediction, though.
Dialogue||It's not up to me to decide what fate entails, I just translate the meaning from what I see. It's hard to be totally unbiased, though.
Dialogue||Well, the study of aeromancy involves studying the shape and consistency of clouds to predict fates. Most of the time I'm not that serious about cloud watching,though.
Dialogue||Sometimes it's nice to disconnect from all of that and just relax, not thinking about anything.
Dialogue||Sounds complex.
Dialogue||You sound like you have a good grasp on it.
Dialogue||It is a bit tricky, but once you've been at it for awhile it gets a lot easier. The hardest part is clearing your mind and staying receptive to the universe.
Dialogue||Cloud watching sounds like a boring pastime.
Dialogue||That sounds very peaceful.
Dialogue||Hm, I didn't know I had asked for your opinion.
Dialogue||It really is. You should try it sometime. Even if it's just for relaxation, our minds and bodies - and our energy! - need that from time to time.
Dialogue||Whenever I see Topi and Pod running around, I know it's only a matter of time before I'll need to treat a scraped knee. I've already got bandages in my pocket, just in case.
Dialogue||Maybe I should be spending more time at the beach... What do you think?
Dialogue||Are you having trouble making friends in town, too?
Dialogue||What, haven't you made any friends since you moved here?
Dialogue||Have you met Elios yet?
Dialogue||Well, I really like Lucia. She speaks with such confidence. I can see why she's the leader here.
Dialogue||Oh, and Nathaniel! He's so tall and strong...  Oh my, I can't believe I just said that! Forget you heard anything!
Dialogue||Lucia thinks I should wait and get more adjusted to the town first. I'm fine with waiting, because the journey sounds a bit scary.
Dialogue||Don't worry, I won't say a thing.
Dialogue||I didn't hear anything!
Dialogue||Oh, phew. I'm having a hard enough time here without people gossiping about me.
Dialogue||You can't let everyone tell you what to do all the time.
Dialogue||It's smart of you to wait until you know you're ready.
Dialogue||Do you think so? I didn't think it was that big of a deal...
Dialogue||You think so? I was worried that I was just being a chicken, but hearing you say that tells me I made the right choice.
Dialogue||Tonya works hard delivering mail, so I don't mind watching Topi during the day.
Dialogue||How's the farm, XX? I wish I had more time to visit and see how far it's coming.
Dialogue||Farmers are good because they make food. That's what Mama says.
Dialogue||I'm not really in a mood to talk, thanks. I've got a lot on my mind.
Dialogue||I have plenty of work of my own to focus on, sorry I can't join you in the fields, love!
Dialogue||Sometimes Emma and I stick our fingers in the sugar when Liam isn't looking... Hehehe.
Dialogue||I'm trying to find a good book for the kids to read, but I've almost read everything the library has to offer.
Dialogue||Maybe you could make up your own stories.
Dialogue||What kind of books do you like to read personally?
Dialogue||Heh, that's a creative idea! I'm afraid I'm not as creative as you, though. I've tried storytelling before, and I'm no good unless the story is written down.
Dialogue||This is a little embarrassing, but I'm a sucker for a good romance. Anything with a "happily ever after" does the trick for me.
Dialogue||I bet you could become a great writer with practice!
Dialogue||You don't have to tell me.
Dialogue||Ah, thanks! I'm not so sure, but everything is worth a proper try, I suppose.
Dialogue||Oh... I'm sorry, have I bored you with my stories in the past? Or... do you mean right now? Hm.
Dialogue||Romance? I should have known!
Dialogue||Romance? I don't see the appeal.
Dialogue||Why, uh, do you say that? Actually you know what, don't answer that question.
Dialogue||No, not even a little? That's too bad. I have one I thought was perfect for you, but I guess I'll just return it to the library.
Dialogue||Grandfather would be so proud to see me now. He'd be proud of you, too, XX. I know it.
Dialogue||I'd love to keep talking, but I'm a bit too busy right now. I'm sure I'll see you later!
Dialogue||For the first time in a long while, the future looks brighter than the present.
Dialogue||Do you remember when we first met?
Dialogue||Sun Haven seems to be doing better these days.
Dialogue||Of course I do! In hindsight, I'm glad Nathaniel walked off with Lynn after you two arrived. I was glad to make an impression of you right away!
Dialogue||I've noticed the same thing! Some extra traffic in town is long overdue, so I'm certainly glad to see it now.
Dialogue||The flames are finally catching, XX. I'm sure Sun Haven will be a roaring fire again soon.
Dialogue||What did you think of me at first?
Dialogue||Were you expecting someone like me?
Dialogue||Well... I was just excited that you were taking over the farm. We needed a farmer quite badly, as you know.
Dialogue||Actually, it was more than that. I was impressed by the risk you took, moving here. You were surprising me right from the beginning, XX!
Dialogue||It's better not to get our hopes up.
Dialogue||I feel like I could live here forever.
Dialogue||For once XX, I disagree. Now is exactly when to get our hopes up.
Dialogue||I've felt that way for a long time now, XX. But having you here makes it that much easier. I know we have a bright future together!
Dialogue||Oh, the farmer. I have a nice view of your farm from my upper story.
Dialogue||Um, did you want to talk for some reason?
Dialogue||I haven't seen you around too much.
Dialogue||That giant house is all yours??
Dialogue||I'm not surprised. I'm usually quite busy at home.
Dialogue||That's right. Living alone in a spacious home helps me focus on my work
Dialogue||What brings you out today?
Dialogue||Do you need help with anything?
Dialogue||I'm hoping to get some inspiration from a new record... again. It won't be long before I buy every record in the store, I swear.
Dialogue||I suppose so, but not help you can give me.
Dialogue||That sounds miserable.
Dialogue||It sounds great to have all that space to yourself!
Dialogue||Call me miserable, then.
Dialogue||You think so? Well that makes two of us.
Dialogue||Seeing you run around town brightens my day.
Dialogue||Why hello again, farmer. Good to see you're getting to know our town.
Dialogue||Do you care to chat for a bit?
Dialogue||I wanted to say, Catherine is a lovely name.
Dialogue||Last time we talked you said you were a witch.
Dialogue||And here I thought I was the charmer! I'm glad to see our newest new neighbor isn't just a stick in the mud.
Dialogue||That's right. Don't tell me that concerns you? Certainly you've already met Lucia.
Dialogue||She doesn't practice witchcraft like I do, but she is Blessed. If her internal connection with magic didn't put you off, I'm sure you won't mind my witchcraft.
Dialogue||What do you mean, newest new neighbor?
Dialogue||Did you expect me to be a stick in the mud?
Dialogue||I only just met the other new arrival, Lynn. Sweet little thing, but not very outspoken.
Dialogue||Nothing against her, but I need someone to keep up with the conversation you know? I feel like such a blabbermouth when someone doesn't talk as much as me.
Dialogue||Not really. It's just that most farmers I've met are not quite as... spirited as you. I promise I mean that in a good way!
Dialogue||So you practice dark magic?
Dialogue||I don't mind it one bit!
Dialogue||I'll only say this once so don't forget - dark magic is for dark wizards. Witches - like me! - practice magic without hurting other people or animals. Got it?
Dialogue||I don't even need to read your aura to see that we will get along famously.
Dialogue||Have you been doing your own smithing? If not, you should give it a try. I bet you'd be great at it!
Dialogue||You've shown me the kind of happiness I didn't think was possible, XX.
Dialogue||Is it just me, or does Sun Haven feel like a different town than it did a few weeks ago?
Dialogue||I guess you never can know what the future holds.
Dialogue||So then, what's the next step for your future?
Dialogue||Nathaniel, What's your proudest moment?
Dialogue||You mean after the service? Hm, I don't really know.
Dialogue||Maybe I really could try to be a sailor, like we talked about.
Dialogue||My proudest moment? Hm... out of all my time in the military, one day stands out.
Dialogue||It was very early in my career. Walking home one night, I heard a lady scream about a monster, so I ran to assist. I put myself between her and the monster and drew my sword.
Dialogue||The monster turned out to be a raccoon eating a really big fish, but I was still proud of my response! That's when I knew I had the instincts of a real soldier.
Dialogue||That's a great idea!
Dialogue||You really think you could?
Dialogue||So you weren't just humoring me on our date?
Dialogue||Heh, nobody's ever supported a dream of mine that wasn't about the military. In fact, I don't know if I've <i>had</i> a dream that wasn't about the military.
Dialogue||If my military time has taught me anything, it's that I can do anything I set my mind to - even if not everyone thinks so.
Dialogue||That's a pretty heroic story... I guess.
Dialogue||Monster or not, you sprung into action!
Dialogue||It was an important moment for me, so I don't even care what anyone else thinks about it.
Dialogue||Exactly! Most people just laugh at that story, but you see things the same way I do.
Dialogue||I heard we were getting a new neighbor. Welcome to Sun Haven, my name's Giuseppe.
Dialogue||What an interesting name! My name is XX.
Dialogue||You think so? I come from a town on the border of the Northern and Eastern Regions. It's a pretty standard name there.
Dialogue||A peaceful society starts with the citizens.
Dialogue||I thought I saw someone flying in the sky over Sun Haven today. I must have been mistaken, right?
Dialogue||My sisters are already talking about you like a parental figure. I hope that doesn't weird you out.
Dialogue||I think that's sweet.
Dialogue||I haven't been a parent before.
Dialogue||Ah, thank goodness for you XX. You're not only perfect for me, but you seem perfect for my sisters too.
Dialogue||Don't worry, I'm still figuring it out too. For the most part, I just try to keep them clean and fed. It's been working so far!
Dialogue||I don't mind them, as long as you're doing the work.
Dialogue||I'm so happy to be part of your family, Liam!
Dialogue||You don't want to help? Not even a little bit? Oh sheesh... we might have a problem, XX.
Dialogue||Honestly, it's a relief having someone to help carry the load. You're too good for me, XX.
Dialogue||There must be more to it than that?
Dialogue||Haven't you had any trouble with them?
Dialogue||Honestly, the girls are big enough now to stay out of trouble on their own.
Dialogue||Sometimes I need to do a little parenting, sure, but they're already very mature for their ages. I lucked out with Emma and Elizabeth!
Dialogue||Settling in all right, are we?
Dialogue||What's on your mind, farmer?
Dialogue||Have you lived here your whole life, doctor?
Dialogue||You're the only doctor in Sun Haven?
Dialogue||No, I relocated from the Southern Islands just about a year ago. The south is great, but I'm lucky to be here. Sun Haven has been good for me.
Dialogue||Don't worry, I'm well-equipped to take care of this town. Besides, almost everyone here is in great health. It's honestly a little boring for me, but I'd much rather be bored than stressed out.
Dialogue||Do you miss the Southern Region?
Dialogue||The south? But you're so...
Dialogue||I'll tell you what I do miss, the fruit. Fruit trees grow all over the place down there. I used to pick a free breakfast while walking to work every day! One less thing to worry about, you know?
Dialogue||I know what you're going to say - I'm very pale. Believe me, it was a challenge growing up on a tropical island with this complexion.
Dialogue||Some people might think that makes you sound lazy.
Dialogue||More people could use a little boredom in their life.
Dialogue||It's a good thing I don't care what some people think!
Dialogue||I agree completely. I always feel better after slowing down and taking a breath. Sun Haven has let me to do that more than ever before.
Dialogue||XX, glad to see you. I don't need anything, or anything like that. I mean, it's just nice seeing you is all.
Dialogue||Er, do you have a question for me? You look like you have a question for me.
Dialogue||I was wondering, do you like to read much?
Dialogue||What's more important to you, being rich or being happy?
Dialogue||Sure! At least, I think I still do. I haven't finished a book in a long time.
Dialogue||Well, being happy is always most important. But it's a lot easier being happy when you've got money... Or, it makes life easier, at least. Ah, does that make me a bad person?
Dialogue||Why is that?
Dialogue||What if you made that a new goal?
Dialogue||Maybe because I'm busy. But, also maybe because I haven't found anything good to read? It's hard to tell.
Dialogue||Sure, I actually feel like I can take on a new goal right now. Will you choose the book for me? I really like adventure novels!
Dialogue||No, you're right. Being comfortable is important.
Dialogue||Money doesn't buy happiness, Liam.
Dialogue||Oh, phew. I thought for sure you'd think I was a greedy person.
Dialogue||Maybe not, but a lack of money sure can make life harder.
Dialogue||Working in Sun Haven is a challenge. I never treated Amari patients before coming here!
Dialogue||Was being a doctor easier where you used to live?
Dialogue||Wouldn't it be easier if you could just chill out all day?
Dialogue||Not necessarily "easier". I used to only provide care to Human patients, but medicine is still difficult whether you're treating a Human or an Amari.
Dialogue||Maybe "simpler" is a better way of putting it. Do you have any idea how good Catherine is at hearing, for instance? Giving her a hearing exam is a real challenge!
Dialogue||It would! But I have to earn my living somehow. Besides, if I got lazy and stopped working, people wouldn't be taken care of. Sure, a new doctor would come around, but...
Dialogue||The only way I know for sure that everyone is getting what they need is to do it myself.
Dialogue||Broadening your horizons never hurt.
Dialogue||So you're saying Catherine has super-hearing?
Dialogue||I've come to appreciate learning more about caring for a diverse range of patients, at least. It's a tough job but someone's gotta do it, and I'm happy it can be me.
Dialogue||Ehh, alright, forget we talked about that, alright? Catherine is a little sensitive of how well her ears work compared to Humans...
Dialogue||I shouldn't have went off and revealed my patient's private matters. Man, where's a windmill when you need one?
Dialogue||You don't have to stress so much.
Dialogue||Sounds like you're a bit egotistical.
Dialogue||You're right. Jun tells me the same thing. I have trouble worrying about everyone's health whenever I take a break, though. Maybe I do need a vacation...
Dialogue||A short one, at least.
Dialogue||Oof, is that how it comes off? I'm just concerned for everyone's well-being.
Dialogue||That Pod is a troublemaker, but I don't mind it. Topi's such a calm boy, he could stand to get into a little mischief.
Dialogue||I'm smiling a lot lot more now. And that's saying something, nya!
Dialogue||I'll remember our wedding day for the rest of my life, XX.
Dialogue||Don't you feel Sun Haven picking up speed? It almost feels like it did ten years ago!
Dialogue||Do you think Sun Haven is actually going to bounce back?
Dialogue||Do you think you'll miss the peace and quiet?
Dialogue||I've always had faith in our little home, you know that. Maybe I'm reading into some misleading energies, but I really think Sun Haven turned a corner recently.
Dialogue||Maybe, but there will always be a quiet corner of Sun Haven. That's part of why I love it here. No matter who you are, there's a place for you here.
Dialogue||I think I've noticed the same thing. Sun Haven is coming back!
Dialogue||One day I hope to be as optimistic as you.
Dialogue||I'm so excited for you to see the town in its prime! Oh, and the tavern is so fun when it's full of strange travelers. XX, I'm glad you're here for this.
Dialogue||It's not optimism, XX. Optimism has no basis. I'm going off of things I see and feel. There's a big difference.
Dialogue||I know I've got a place here... with you!
Dialogue||I'm just glad we can stop worrying so much for the town's future.
Dialogue||Oh, extra cheesy today? Mm, I love that kind of cheese!
Dialogue||Maybe, but let's not declare victory just yet. We shouldn't slow down before we're there, you know?
Dialogue||XX, let's keep working to make Sun Haven the best it can be!
Dialogue||Hoy, XX! Can you feel that wind? It's going to be a beautiful day.
Dialogue||You have a question for me?
Dialogue||So are you from Sun Haven originally?
Dialogue||Have you always been a fisherman?
Dialogue||I've lived here all my life, so you tell me! Yep, I know this town backward and forward. Not a thing I would change about it. Other towns just can't compare.
Dialogue||Not always. I used to run trade with my ship, but I got tired of that. I don't like traveling on routes as much as sailing the sea freely.
Dialogue||There are a few things I would change...
Dialogue||I'll take your word for it!
Dialogue||Well, change them or don't. Complaints don't solve a thing.
Dialogue||Well I've visited every port town on the western coast, so I'm not just blowing hot air here!
Dialogue||Does fishing allow you more freedom, then?
Dialogue||Did you like having a trade ship?
Dialogue||Sure does! Now I just follow the weather and my own natural instinct. The sea guides me.
Dialogue||It was a decent living with regular work. Boring, though. Not nearly as exciting as feeling the first nibble on the end of your fishing line.
Dialogue||I was just thinking about you, XX!
Dialogue||I have some free time. Want to chat?
Dialogue||Say, what kind of music do you like?
Dialogue||Do you like pets, Nathaniel?
Dialogue||I'm not picky, I like just about anything I can dance to.
Dialogue||What's with the look? I'm a great dancer, ask any of the soldiers! Except Calvin. He's very, very sarcastic.
Dialogue||I grew up with a dog named Pancake, but we can't have pets in the barracks. But I would love to have a dog again one day!
Dialogue||When did you learn to dance?
Dialogue||What's your best dancing story?
Dialogue||It was on deployment in the far west. There was a fun band playing in a tavern and a pretty woman just dragged me onto my feet.
Dialogue||She may have stolen my wallet, but I didn't even care because she made me feel like the best dancer in the world!
Dialogue||I love dogs too!
Dialogue||I've never been a dog person.
Dialogue||I knew you would! Dogs are so loyal, they're the perfect companions. We even use them in the military to find lost people, sometimes.
Dialogue||That's a surprise. Dogs are so sweet and fun! How can you not like them?
Dialogue||Hey there, XX. How are the, ehm, seeds growing?
Dialogue||What makes you ask about my seeds?
Dialogue||You should start your own garden!
Dialogue||Heh, it was a bad attempt at small talk, I know. We've been talking so much recently, though. I wanted to try asking you something related to farming.
Dialogue||...But I suddenly realize I know nothing about it, really. I feel guilty, you've talked to me so much about my music.
Dialogue||I don't think I could do anything like that. What would I even grow? Flowers? Potatoes?
Dialogue||I appreciate the effort.
Dialogue||Yeah, maybe stick to your music from now on.
Dialogue||I've never been the best at making friends, XX. I want to try and change that, though. So thanks for giving me some credit.
Dialogue||That seems unusually blunt for you, XX. If that's how you feel, then forget it.
Dialogue||I could show you the ropes sometime.
Dialogue||Maybe gardening isn't for everyone.
Dialogue||An... interesting proposal, but I don't know about that. I like to stick with what I'm comfortable with, but the offer is appreciated.
Dialogue||This is true. I was never cut out to be a farmer, if that wasn't incredibly obvious.
Dialogue||The most exciting thing about being a witch is seeing what others don't. The energies have been so active lately! It feels like something big is right on the horizon.
Dialogue||Was it hard to learn how to read those energies?
Dialogue||It took a lot of work to get where I am as a witch, but I've never been left feeling like it didn't pay off.
Dialogue||I wouldn't be the same person without my abilities. You can relate to that, can't you?
Dialogue||I can answer this without reading any energies. I'm very happy with our relationship together, XX.
Dialogue||When you first moved to town, I felt a special aura about you. I just never expected to be part of it! I'm glad though, because when I think of the future, it's you I see.
Dialogue||Honestly? I can.
Dialogue||Honestly? I'm not sure.
Dialogue||Heh, I knew I didn't even have to ask. You understand completely.
Dialogue||You really don't know for sure? That's not what I expected to hear. I guess you don't feel the way I do.
Dialogue||Hopefully you aren't wrong.
Dialogue||I see you in the future, too, Catherine.
Dialogue||Is there a reason you think I'd be wrong, XX...?
Dialogue||Do you mean that? It's looking like the universe brought us together for a reason!
Dialogue||XX, have you ever tried painting? I'll teach you how sometime!
Dialogue||You're so talented, Jun. I'm jealous!
Dialogue||You're always teaching. Do you ever get tired of teaching the kids?
Dialogue||It's no big deal, I just find things that relax my mind and practice them. It's the same with meditation.
Dialogue||Do you have a hobby like that, something that relaxes you?
Dialogue||I'll never get tired of it, especially with the children. Helping them learn how to problem-solve and follow their curiosity makes my days feel meaningful.
Dialogue||One day I'll be teaching my own kids and watching them grow, and that will be even more meaningful.
Dialogue||For me, it's farming.
Dialogue||You relax me more than anything, Jun.
Dialogue||Of course, I should have guessed that one.
Dialogue||Ah, XX! You're too good at making me blush!
Dialogue||Aw Jun, you're going to be the best dad one day!
Dialogue||I don't know how you can stand being around kids that much.
Dialogue||Thank you, XX. That means a lot, especially coming from you.
Dialogue||I didn't know you had so much trouble with children, XX. That could be a problem one day.
Dialogue||My life in Sun Haven was always warm and sunny, but now it's better than I ever could've imagined. I love you, XX.
Dialogue||Hi XX! I'm a little bored. Any ideas, nya?
Dialogue||Do you have any hobbies?
Dialogue||You seem like the kind of cat who'd like dancing!
Dialogue||I try teaching tricks to my pet kittens, but they're too sleepy to learn. Oh, and I loooove sewing and knitting clothes! I especially love yarn, it's so soft and colorful and happy!
Dialogue||Oh yes, but only to the right music. I can't dance to boring music, like what Claude listens to. It has to be energetic, like Kitty!
Dialogue||I'm not so sure cats could use their hands that well.
Dialogue||Looking at your dress, I bet you make really great clothes!
Dialogue||Cats are very good with their hands. Plus, you haven't even seen my stuff I've made, nyan.
Dialogue||Oh yes, even the house cats love them! No you silly, I don't put them in the clothes, they like to lay on top of them!
Dialogue||What's the right kind of music?
Dialogue||Somehow I think you could dance to anything.
Dialogue||Fast music, for certain. I like a fast beat, nya! That's what gets my paws tapping!
Dialogue||Maybe, maybe. Kitty dances in the grass, sometimes with no music at all!
Dialogue||Keeping a sharp mind and body, XX?
Dialogue||Why do you ask if my body is sharp?
Dialogue||Look, I've always been meaning to ask. How do you do your hair?
Dialogue||Good question. Well, it's my belief that mental and physical health are very closely linked with one another.
Dialogue||A healthy body is important in order to have a healthy mind and spirit. That's why I tell all my clients to try to eat a good diet and get plenty of sleep.
Dialogue||Catherine developed it for me, using her plants. I had no idea something like Greenroot could be used to make a hair dye! I think my hair really expresses my individuality.
Dialogue||That's a very interesting theory.
Dialogue||Maybe save physiology for Wornhardt.
Dialogue||It is, isn't it. It's important that we be mindful to keep every component of ourselves healthy and strong.
Dialogue||I'm sorry you don't see the importance of a mind-body balance, XX. I hope you do well and feel good, regardless.
Dialogue||But is your hair blue with dark dye, or dark with blue dye?
Dialogue||You're certainly a unique person, Jun.
Dialogue||Oh, I can't spoil the mystery completely, can I? You'll just have to use your imagination, XX, heh.
Dialogue||Everyone is unique in their own way. Whether it's a hairstyle or a favorite food. In a way, we're all different. That's what makes the world so special, I think.
Dialogue||I'm always looking for a new way to express myself.
Dialogue||I've been in such a good mood lately. I think I have you to blame!
Dialogue||Have I told you that you're glowing? Because you're glowing.
Dialogue||You're always cheerful, even before we were a couple.
Dialogue||Oh, shut up! You're just saying that because you think you have to.
Dialogue||I guess that's true. Well, mostly. I don't get angry often, but when I do it is <i>not</i> pretty. I hope you never have to see it.
Dialogue||I'm saying it because it's true.
Dialogue||I don't have to, but I like to!
Dialogue||OH! I just realized - I dropped a bag of luminous powder in the back of my shop. That must be why I'm glowing.
Dialogue||... I still liked the compliment, though.
Dialogue||I bet you're pretty when you're angry, too.
Dialogue||I'm curious now, I want to see it.
Dialogue||That is so not what I meant! You get away with it this time, XX.
Dialogue||Don't even joke, XX. I'm telling you, I don't hold back when I'm mad. Even for you!
Dialogue||My blade has grown ever so dull. I suppose it <i>has</i> been fifty years since I had it sharpened.
Dialogue||Your sword sure does make you look imposing.
Dialogue||It's been fifty years since you sharpened your sword?
Dialogue||You really think so, hm? Of course you do. I am Darius, prince of Withergate! Son of Minos! Might is my right, and my choice in arms reflects that.
Dialogue||This blade is more powerful than most any other. I've cut down foes in full Mithril as if they were wheat to a scythe.
Dialogue||It rarely needs service, despite how often I might use it.
Dialogue||It isn't just a weapon, however. It is a symbol of my family's raw strength. What I hold here is my family's legacy.
Dialogue||Isn't it heavy?
Dialogue||I'd like to give it a swing sometime.
Dialogue||For lesser beings, maybe. For me, commanding this blade is second nature.
Dialogue||You have bold desires, XX. But this blade belongs solely to me. Besides, I doubt you could even lift it from the ground, let alone swing it.
Dialogue||This is a blade meant for a wielder who is of, shall we say... a higher caliber.
Dialogue||I suppose such a powerful blade suits you.
Dialogue||You'd better take care of it quickly.
Dialogue||You are right, XX. I have to keep myself in perfect condition, especially my weaponry. My reputation must always precede me, after all.
Dialogue||I'll have Xyla deal with it.
Dialogue||Watch how you speak, XX. We are friends, but I am still the prince. You don't give the commands, <i>I do</i>.
Dialogue||Don't you just love the open ocean? Breathing in that salty air... it gives me life!
Dialogue||I still can't believe someone like you would marry someone like me... Obviously I'm happy about it!
Dialogue||Maybe the "long white coat" look is going out of style...
Dialogue||XX, I just realized I never ask you about your farm. I feel like such a jerk! I hope it's going well for you.
Dialogue||I enjoyed our last date!
Dialogue||Liam, did you ever go to visit Elios?
Dialogue||Oh, me too! It was nice getting my mind off everyday things.
Dialogue||I did, not long after moving here. Roza escorted me up the mountain with Emma and Elizabeth.
Dialogue||At first I was scared of the monsters, but then I saw Roza in action. She's scarier than any monster up there, that's for sure.
Dialogue||Elios didn't bless me, but he did say he saw promise in the girls. We're supposed to visit him again in five years and I really don't know what to make of that.
Dialogue||Maybe I could take your mind off things again? Let's go on another date!
Dialogue||It was fun, but we should just be friends.
Dialogue||Really? I mean, sure! I'd really like that. I'm pretty busy with the girls though. Would you mind a night in at my house? If that's fine, then come by tomorrow night at 5:00 pm.
Dialogue||Oh. I mean, yeah. I was just going to say, uh, the same thing. Yep.
Dialogue||It was dangerous for you to bring your sisters.
Dialogue||I'm glad Elios welcomed you. It's nice having you here.
Dialogue||Roza really had everything under control. I wouldn't purposely put my sisters in danger, you know.
Dialogue||Oh, yeah? Heh, I'm glad too. New places aren't always so welcoming. Moving to new towns in the north, it can be weeks before you even learn someone's name.
Dialogue||I'm feeling good about Sun Haven. Actually, I'm feeling good about everything!
Dialogue||What are you staring at? Haven't seen a classy lady like me before?
Dialogue||XX, look! See that cloud? That's a sign of good fortune to come! ... Or a sign of personal injury. Hang on, I need to check my aeromancy booklet.
Dialogue||Keep your head up, XX.
Dialogue||I caught a huge fish last night! It was too beautiful to keep, so I let it go.
Dialogue||... Okay, it broke my line.
Dialogue||That's unlucky. You'll get it next time.
Dialogue||Not with my lines, but this was one tough customer. I fought it for a full hour!
Dialogue||That's the right attitude. A fisherman's best tool is patience. I learned that from an old fish-trapper while I was waiting out a storm in the east.
Dialogue||Can you believe they do all their fishing with traps over there? It's true, no lines or nets!
Dialogue||It sounds like your gear failed you.
Dialogue||Some fish are really amazing.
Dialogue||My equipment is top-notch, buddy. You think you can make a stronger line? Be my guest.
Dialogue||No kidding! This isn't a loss for me though - it's a challenge. One day, I'll catch that fish.
Dialogue||Do you use traps?
Dialogue||Do traps work better than rods?
Dialogue||Nah, I prefer the struggle between fish and man. The instant you get a bite on the hook is a special experience. For a split-second, nothing else in the world matters.
Dialogue||Maybe for small fish, but I'm always after the big fish. You strike me as a big fish kind of person, too!
Dialogue||How does being married to the Archmage of Sun Haven feel? Hopefully it feels as good as being married to the farmer of Sun Haven!
Dialogue||Happy day, XX!
Dialogue||I'm pretty busy today, but I'll be thinking of you the whole way through.
Dialogue||Hmph. That's odd, could I seriously have miscounted?
Dialogue||I'm shocked you made a mistake in your counting!
Dialogue||So what's the problem?
Dialogue||Hey, no one's perfect. My income does rely on being precise, however...
Dialogue||It seems I accidentally ordered too much iron ore. I had a contract to supply Rex, but now I've got extra...
Dialogue||I'm sure you'll find it again, and then it's like a bonus!
Dialogue||So work double-time and make up the loss!
Dialogue||Heh. XX, I like the way you think. I'd prefer to have it now, but I suppose that's just life sometimes.
Dialogue||That's a good idea. Glad I thought of it first! I'm already calculating how to make up this little mishap. More importantly, though, is how to ensure it doesn't happen again.
Dialogue||So what? Just give him the extra ore as a gift.
Dialogue||Maybe Solon would buy it?
Dialogue||I... I... I don't know what to say... That is genuinely a terrible suggestion, XX!
Dialogue||I'm trying to run a business. If Rex wants the extra ore, Rex can pay for it.
Dialogue||Silly XX, trying to play merchant like me.
Dialogue||Solon is only interested in refined bars, though perhaps if I had someone to turn the ores into bars for me then I could make my money back.
Dialogue||Hey there, sweetie. How does it feel to be the other half of Sun Haven's number one couple?
Dialogue||I didn't realize we were ranked!
Dialogue||Does being married change your plans at all?
Dialogue||Sure we are! Look at everything we get done on our own - we practically run this town apart, so think of what we can do now that we're together! This is the start of a venture like no other!
Dialogue||I guess it isn't a whole lot different than before. But with you on my side, there's no end to what I could accomplish!!
Dialogue||Well, what <i>we</i> could accomplish, I mean. Sorry, my head is racing right now with possibilities.
Dialogue||All right, I'm on board!
Dialogue||All right, don't get ahead of yourself.
Dialogue||Of course you are XX, this is a lifelong commitment after all. I can already see our success building right in front of us...
Dialogue||Sorry XX, my momentum only ever increases. Better get ready, because you're in this with me, now!
Dialogue||What kind of possibilities?
Dialogue||I'm glad to be your inspiration!
Dialogue||The most obvious one is, I could sell your produce on my cart. Heck, I could even cart it to nearby villages and charge extra!
Dialogue||Two great people are going to have that affect when you put them together, aren't they?
Dialogue||Ah, my trusted companion. I'm always glad to see you, XX. You distract me from my daily troubles.
Dialogue||I feel close to you too, Darius.
Dialogue||You make me feel invincible.
Dialogue||Then we should go out again. Surely, your answer must be yes?
Dialogue||I have something for you, XX. It won't make you invincible, but it's as close as you can get. My family's enchanted heirloom.
Dialogue||This royal heirloom will make you undefeatable. Will you take it as a gift from me?
Dialogue||I'm afraid not, Darius.
Dialogue||I would love to, Darius!
Dialogue||I see. Not just anyone can reject the prince of Demons. You're truly something special, XX.
Dialogue||Fantastic! Meet me outside of the apartment building tomorrow at 5:00 pm.
Dialogue||Of course, I accept!
Dialogue||Are you sure?
Dialogue||I know this heirloom is destined for you. Take it, keep it proudly and let its strength flow through you.
Dialogue||We should spar one day!
Dialogue||XX, be honest... Does my face look more square today? I've been trying to exercise my jaw.
Dialogue||I think it's working! I think.
Dialogue||I had fun on our date the other day. I was thinking we could do it again!
Dialogue||Oh I almost forgot - XX, close your eyes! I have something for you.
Dialogue||I did too. Talking to you is easy for some reason. It's not often I get to speak so freely. I'd love to go out with you another time!
Dialogue||Okay, my eyes are closed.
Dialogue||No way, just give it to me!
Dialogue||All right, here. This is my helmet. It was crafted specially for me when I first joined the military.
Dialogue||XX, this helmet saved my head more than once. I want it to protect you now. Go on, have it!
Dialogue||Great, let's do it!
Dialogue||It should probably be a one-time thing.
Dialogue||Meet me at the barracks tomorrow at 5:00 pm. I'm looking forward to it!
Dialogue||Do you think so? If that's what you want, I'll respect your wishes.
Dialogue||Living here is a lot easier now that I have someone I can really count on... Oh, of course I'm talking about you!
Dialogue||Hello, you must be the one who bought the old farm. I'm Liam, it's good to meet you.
Dialogue||Pleasure to meet you, Liam. I'm XX.
Dialogue||Likewise! My name's Liam. Wait, I said that already...
Dialogue||Ever since we started dating, the soldiers have been whispering and giving me funny looks. I don't get it!
Dialogue||They must be curious about us.
Dialogue||Are you worried this will affect your authority with them?
Dialogue||Lester and Allison, maybe. But Calvin? I can't imagine he cares one bit.
Dialogue||Oh, no. If anything, they will make some jokes behind my back and forget about it. I've been their captain too long for them to see me as anything else.
Dialogue||Be honest - do you like the attention?
Dialogue||Does it bother you that they talk about us?
Dialogue||I've never cared to be the center of attention, not unless I'm addressing my soldiers. But I guess there's something kind of fun about it!
Dialogue||The way you maintain your authority is always impressive.
Dialogue||I wouldn't be so sure.
Dialogue||Heh, you think so? Well thanks, XX.
Dialogue||Somehow you always find a way to boost me up, even when I don't think I need it.
Dialogue||You don't know them like I do, XX.
Dialogue||No thanks, I'm not feeling too chatty right now.
Dialogue||I hope you don't think it's boring that I'm just a baker.
Dialogue||Everything seems so golden and new to me. I have you to thank for that.
Dialogue||Don't worry about acting proper just because you're dating the Archmage. I like you best when you're relaxed.
Dialogue||Sometimes I see Roza's sword and think I should get an upgrade... What do you think, XX?
Dialogue||You shouldn't compare.
Dialogue||Why does she have such a big sword anyway?
Dialogue||Heh, you almost sound like my mother. You're right, anyway. Her sword is just so <i>big</i>.
Dialogue||In battle, she uses her sword as a shield in a tight spot. I've seen it in action, Roza switches between offense and defense in the blink of an eye.
Dialogue||It's a big part of why I made her my second-in-command. Not just because she's tough, but because she's smart.
Dialogue||Your sword is a little dinky.
Dialogue||You know that doesn't matter.
Dialogue||I knew it... the soldiers must have been laughing at me this whole time.
Dialogue||You're right, you're right. A sword is only as sharp as the soldier that holds it.
Dialogue||Have you ever sparred with her?
Dialogue||That's a ridiculous strategy.
Dialogue||Heh, actually I haven't. And I don't plan to! There's no point in making me look bad in front of the soldiers.
Dialogue||You say that, but you haven't seen her in battle. Trust me XX, she knows what she's doing.
Dialogue||Sometimes I get bored at home, but it's easy to relax around you. XX, you're like magic!
Dialogue||It's funny - I can never tell when you're relaxed.
Dialogue||Kitty, are you happy in our relationship?
Dialogue||That's because I'm still a kitten at heart, nya nya. Even when I'm relaxing, I am ready to pounce!
Dialogue||Wha? Of course Kitty is happy! I'm always so joyful around you, XX.
Dialogue||In fact... I have been thinking a looot about the next step for us! Do you know what Kitty is talking about, XX?
Dialogue||Kitty will give you a hint - I'm ready to be with you <i>forever!</i>
Dialogue||That's what makes you fun!
Dialogue||I want to be more like you, Kitty - I want to have more fun!
Dialogue||I think so too, even if some people say I need to grow up. I only want to be my natural self!
Dialogue||It's a good thing we're dating, nya! We can always have fun together!
Dialogue||I don't understand.
Dialogue||I think I understand!
Dialogue||Oh nyan... Maybe this isn't the right time after all.
Dialogue||Good good! It's the perfect time, XX. I'm ready and very very excited!
Dialogue||What do you think about the barracks? Pretty cool, right?
Dialogue||You've grown so much stronger since you arrived. It's a relief knowing that you can handle yourself if you have to.
Dialogue||You make Sun Haven feel more like home than ever before. I didn't think that was a possibility!
Dialogue||Do you think people will talk about you, marrying a farmer?
Dialogue||You seem more relaxed these days.
Dialogue||I should think not. Regardless, it doesn't matter one bit - people can talk all they want, but their words don't have to mean a thing to us.
Dialogue||I'm sure I know why that is - don't act coy, clearly I'm talking about you, XX!
Dialogue||I have more balance between work and my personal life than I ever have before. I'm surprised at how much of a relief I feel, to be honest.
Dialogue||I don't know, I wouldn't want to hurt your career.
Dialogue||You're right, it's none of their business
Dialogue||My career is mine alone to worry about. Focus on your own problems, XX.
Dialogue||I would prefer to worry about ourselves and forget about others when we're together.
Dialogue||You're not worried that you're working less because of me?
Dialogue||It's delightful to see you smiling so much.
Dialogue||Not one bit! Even if I am working slightly less, it actually feels like I'm thinking more clearly. I would even say I'm getting more work done than I was before.
Dialogue||XX, for that I have you to thank. My inner fire is burning brighter than ever with your love.
Dialogue||Hey, XX! Running into you during the day is always a treat.
Dialogue||Giuseppe is such a softie. I love it!
Dialogue||I never thought I would find somebody to marry this early in my life. I'm happy it turned out this way!
Dialogue||Keep your chin up, XX - it's going to be a good day.
Dialogue||Are you single, Nathaniel?
Dialogue||Nathaniel, are you busy tomorrow? I think we should go out together!
Dialogue||Sure am! Hm, maybe I shouldn't say that so excitedly.
Dialogue||Er, yes. Currently.
Dialogue||I'm busy every day, but I can make time for a friend. What did you have in mind?
Dialogue||I figured you would be.
Dialogue||I'm sure you have an admirer or two in town.
Dialogue||Oh. Am I... that bad?
Dialogue||Well, I wouldn't know about that... I just try to be friendly, is all.
Dialogue||Let's go on a proper date.
Dialogue||Actually, nevermind.
Dialogue||Oh! Absolutely, that sounds like fun!
Dialogue||You can meet me at the barracks at 12:00 pm and we'll go from there.
Dialogue||Oh? Okay, well come find me if you need anything else.
Dialogue||I want a little sister, but mom says dad is too lazy to go and get one!
Dialogue||You should tell your dad to try harder!
Dialogue||What would you do if you had a little sister?
Dialogue||I try to, but he never listens. He just says "we'll see about it soon," but I want a sister now!
Dialogue||That's easy. I'd teach her where my best hiding spots are, and how to play Dragons!
Dialogue||I'd bet you'll have a little sister before you know it.
Dialogue||You shouldn't whine like that.
Dialogue||You really think so, XX? I hope it's a sister and not a brother, or Pod will get jealous!
Dialogue||You sound like my mom.
Dialogue||What if she's better at Dragons than you?
Dialogue||Where are your best hiding spots?
Dialogue||Then we'd be the best brother and sister Dragon team ever!
Dialogue||Well there's one right behind the record shop where... just kidding! I'm never telling you, XX!
Dialogue||All these Withergate rumors... they're not what Sun Haven needs right now.
Dialogue||Ah, XX... You make my heart beat so so strong!
Dialogue||When you walk up to me, my heart starts beating fast. But for a totally different reason than with everyone else.
Dialogue||I've got a bad blister on my hand. I should hire some muscle to move my crates around for me.
Dialogue||Is there anything you need? I want to be sure you're completely taken care of.
Dialogue||You don't need to worry about me.
Dialogue||I can't help it, it's my job! You might as well ask a bird not to fly or sing.
Dialogue||I'll always be looking after you, XX.
Dialogue||Of course I am, XX. Aren't you, or is something wrong?
Dialogue||I wouldn't have it any other way.
Dialogue||We'll look after each other, Jun.
Dialogue||Heh, that's so like you. You always let me be myself.
Dialogue||Heh, that's so like you. Only you would think to take care of the counselor.
Dialogue||I have doubts.
Dialogue||I'm just thinking about our future together.
Dialogue||Well, at least we're talking about it. Addressing the problem is always the first step. I'm willing to work through this if you are, XX.
Dialogue||Oh... XX, if you're saying what I think you're saying then you should know that I've already thought about this a lot.
Dialogue||I'm not afraid of commitment, and the idea of being with you for the rest of my life is... a dream!
Dialogue||Hi... sweetie! I had some free time today and spent it in the library. It was so nice and quiet.
Dialogue||Oh, are we using pet names, "sweetie?"
Dialogue||What books do you like to read?
Dialogue||We don't have to! I think it's cute, is all. I'll stop if you think it's dumb.
Dialogue||These days all I have time for is texts on metallurgical techniques. Sorry, I mean books on smithing. But before I was an apprentice, I could lose myself in a good mystery novel.
Dialogue||Yeah, I'd rather not do that.
Dialogue||It is cute... pumpkin!
Dialogue||Oh, okay. I guess I'll just stick with XX.
Dialogue||Oh, good! I wasn't sure what you'd think. Like usual, we're on the same page. Everything is easy with you, XX.
Dialogue||Why do you like mystery novels?
Dialogue||Mysteries are fun - I love the big reveals at the end.
Dialogue||I love the sidekicks. A sidekick always saves the main character's life at some point. Without the strong little sidekicks, the mysteries would never get solved.
Dialogue||I'll keep the birds from eating your crops, XX. That's a Kitty promise!
Dialogue||I've never been the best at courtship. If only it were more like sword fighting.
Dialogue||I hope you're staying out of trouble - it would look bad if I was dating a criminal!
Dialogue||You mean you wouldn't cover for me?
Dialogue||Have you ever gotten into serious trouble before?
Dialogue||Luckily, it won't come to that because you're a good citizen who doesn't commit crimes. Right?
Dialogue||The most trouble I ever got into was as a kid. I stole a toy slingshot by hiding it in my pants.
Dialogue||I didn't even make it out of the store before they caught me. The sling was still hanging out the back of my pants. I guess I wasn't cut out to be a criminal.
Dialogue||Riiiight...
Dialogue||Right!
Dialogue||I hope you're only joking because I really don't want to turn you in. For the record, I would if I had to.
Dialogue||I thought so! I really don't want to turn you in for a crime, XX.
Dialogue||What happened to you?
Dialogue||Did you feel guilty?
Dialogue||I felt terrible after getting caught. My mom didn't yell at me or anything, but she was completely disappointed. In a way, that was much worse than being yelled at.
Dialogue||And of course, she grounded me for a month.
Dialogue||If you're wasting my time, you're wasting my money.
Dialogue||There's a lot that I like about this town, especially the people. Everyone's a good neighbor here - including you, XX!
Dialogue||Who do you spend the most time with in Sun Haven?
Dialogue||What's your favorite thing about Sun Haven?
Dialogue||You're asking who I'm friends with? Well, the soldiers are my family. But other than them...
Dialogue||Dr. Wornhardt has a good head. Kitty is always a riot. Lucia, of course. Solon is a real man's man. Then you've got Peter, Judith and Albert... You know, I think I get along with just about everyone in this town!
Dialogue||I would say it's the weather, hands down. I've been stationed in some terrible weather before, so I'm really enjoying the sunshine here.
Dialogue||If anyone could make friends with everyone, it would be you.
Dialogue||Nobody gets along with everyone. I bet you're pretending!
Dialogue||What can I say, I've always had an easy time making friends. All you have to do is treat people nicely. What's hard about that?
Dialogue||It's sad you can't believe that I'm nice enough to have a lot of friends... It tells me a lot about you, XX.
Dialogue||Where's the worst place you've been stationed?
Dialogue||If you could live anywhere, where would it be?
Dialogue||My first assignment was protecting an outpost from ice ghasts in the freezing north. Given the orders, I would take that fight again without blinking... but I'm sure thankful to be here instead!
Dialogue||You know, I don't think I have an answer. The military takes me all over the world so I've lived just about everywhere.
Dialogue||I guess I care less about where I am than who I'm with. I'd be happy to settle just about anywhere if I had family with me - and maybe a dog!
Dialogue||I feel like cooking tonight! But what to cook, what to cook...
Dialogue||Jingle jingle, don't you like how Kitty's bells jingle? Teehee.
Dialogue||Your bells must make sneaking up on critters hard.
Dialogue||Why do you have so many jingle bells on your outfit, anyway?
Dialogue||Give Kitty more credit, XX! If Kitty is prowling, the bells don't make a sound! Kitty only jingles with Kitty wants to jingle!
Dialogue||I just like the sound they make! Jingle jingle! Kitty can make music whenever, wherever! Claude says Kitty's bells don't count as music, but Kitty disagrees! Nya!
Dialogue||Makes sense. You're a cat, after all.
Dialogue||You can really move that quietly?
Dialogue||Why do you think my name is <i>Kitty</i>, nya?!
Dialogue||Of course, of course! It's real easy for Kitty to be nice and quiet! When Kitty wants to be, of course! Other times Kitty jingle, jingle, jingles! Nya!
Dialogue||Claude can be very picky about music.
Dialogue||Claude isn't wrong.
Dialogue||Teehee, I knew you'd understand. Claude is just a stick-in-the-mud! Jingle jingle!
Dialogue||Nyan? Kitty didn't think XX was such a stick-in-the-mud! You must be hanging out with Claude too much, nya!
Dialogue||Who knows how much longer the army will keep us in Sun Haven? Frankly, I don't care if they keep us here forever.
Dialogue||What would you do if you were shipped out somewhere else?
Dialogue||I'm guessing your soldiers might not agree, though.
Dialogue||If the army took me someplace else, I'd have to go. Whether I like it or not, that's what it means to give your service to the military.
Dialogue||What would you do if I had to leave?
Dialogue||If they want to leave Sun Haven, then they don't have their heads on straight.
Dialogue||Anyway, any one of them can file for a transfer at any time. If I don't get any transfer requests, then I assume they're all happy.
Dialogue||I would wait here for you.
Dialogue||I would move on.
Dialogue||You would, really? That's extremely romantic, XX! I can't believe I got so lucky with you.
Dialogue||Ouch. Just like that, huh? Maybe we aren't equally invested in this marriage, XX.
Dialogue||Have you ever transferred that way?
Dialogue||Why do they let soldiers transfer, anyway?
Dialogue||Only once. I transferred from the Northern Region to the Great City when my mother was sick so I could care for her.
Dialogue||I was worried about her, but I was more than happy to leave the old, cold north behind.
Dialogue||Well, I had to do it once. I transferred from the Northern Region to the Great City when my mother was sick so I could care for her.
Dialogue||Can I be honest with you, XX? The beach is looking really good right about now!
Dialogue||I thought you didn't take vacations.
Dialogue||What's your favorite thing to do when you're at the beach?
Dialogue||A quick trip down to the sand isn't the same thing as a vacation. I love to wiggle my toes into the warm sand every now and again.
Dialogue||Actually, I'd love to learn to make a good sand castle. I see the children doing it all the time, but I don't think I'd be any good at it. Maybe they would have to teach me!
Dialogue||I could get some sand between my toes!
Dialogue||Aren't you worried about crabs pinching you?
Dialogue||Maybe you can join me sometime! If we ever find ourselves with free time, of course. Don't forget to take care of your work first.
Dialogue||Oh, come now. I'm the Archmage of Sun Haven. I'm not going to worry about a few small crabs trying to nip me on the toes. At least, I won't worry much, anyways!
Dialogue||You do make a pretty good student.
Dialogue||As if a bunch of kids would have anything to teach you.
Dialogue||I feel confident with learning new things, really. I have the challenges I overcame during my upbringing to thank for that.
Dialogue||It's a shame to learn that you feel that way. There's so much in our lives we can learn from, especially children.
Dialogue||Hello there, XX. The other day I was speaking with Nathaniel and he tells me there's been a noticable decline in monsters outside the town borders.
Dialogue||You wouldn't happen to be responsible, would you?
Dialogue||I've slain a few monsters, I suppose.
Dialogue||Is the town in any danger of monsters?
Dialogue||You can farm <i>and</i> fight! Very commendable, XX. Truly, I mean that. It isn't your job, but the safer the forests beyond the town are, the better!
Dialogue||Sun Haven itself is completely secure, though you should know that by now. However, the forests are teeming with dangerous monsters.
Dialogue||Travel, at least by foot, is therefore quite dangerous for those who can't defend themselves. Someday I want to change that, and make travel of all kinds safe for everyone.
Dialogue||Can't the guards deal with monsters on their own?
Dialogue||Don't mention it, it's great to help out.
Dialogue||Well of course the town is capable of defending itself, XX. The guards do an excellent job, and I'm always ready to help fill in when needed.
Dialogue||I merely wanted to thank you for helping out.
Dialogue||That's the kind of attitude we need in Sun Haven! We're very lucky to have someone as muti-talented as you here. Elios said he sensed great potential in you, and it shows.
Dialogue||How will you accomplish that vision?
Dialogue||There's a lot of monsters in the forest!
Dialogue||It might sound like a big task, but Sun Haven hosts some very strong soldiers. Perhaps we could establish dedicated monster slaying units?
Dialogue||Though I'd hate to put any of our troops in harm's way. Hm, I'll have to really put some thought into this.
Dialogue||Though I'd hate to put any of our troops directly in harm's way. Hm, I'll have to really put some thought into this.
Dialogue||Do I have any icing on my face? I was teaching Elizabeth to decorate cakes earlier and things got messy.
Dialogue||Don't worry, your face is perfect.
Dialogue||Have you told the girls that we're dating?
Dialogue||Well I wouldn't call it perfect...
Dialogue||I had that conversation with them last night. It took a looooot of explaining, but they know about us now.
Dialogue||They were more curious than anything, but they're excited that I'm "best friends with the farmer." Especially Emma!
Dialogue||Well I think you're the sweetest guy in Sun Haven - literally!
Dialogue||Don't sell yourself short, Liam. You're the handsomest guy in Sun Haven!
Dialogue||Ah sheesh, and now I think I'm the embarrassed-est guy in Sun Haven. You know compliments make me self-conscious!
Dialogue||I don't really care what they think about us, anyway.
Dialogue||It sounds like you handled it well. I'm glad you told them.
Dialogue||Is that true? I'm surprised you don't care what they think.
Dialogue||Thanks, I was on the fence about it at first. I don't even know why, now that I think about it.
Dialogue||Oh! It's you...
Dialogue||Um, the new farmer! Sorry, you caught me with my head in the clouds. I'm Jun.
Dialogue||I didn't mean to startle you. My name's XX.
Dialogue||No no, it's fine. I was just in my head is all. It's really nice meeting you, XX.
Dialogue||You again. I expect you've learned to watch your tongue around me.
Dialogue||My father didn't build this place from nothing just to have peasants like you disrespecting the royal family.
Dialogue||Withergate is quite impressive.
Dialogue||How did your father become king of Withergate?
Dialogue||Of course it is. I didn't design the city myself, but I personally recommended the architect. Xyla is well known among monsters for her skill and ferocity.
Dialogue||My family has always been royalty among monsters and Withergate was founded by my family. Is it so hard to put two and two together?
Dialogue||You must have good taste in friends, then.
Dialogue||I've already met her!
Dialogue||I only give my time freely to people of a certain class - a class to which you don't belong.
Dialogue||That's good. Now you've seen an example of who earns my respect.
Dialogue||I didn't know - please forgive my ignorance!
Dialogue||I was only wondering.
Dialogue||Of course not, you know nothing. I've heard the talk among the Humans in Sun Haven. Such tiny, stupid people.
Dialogue||Go waste someone else's time with your idiotic questions.
Dialogue||I knew that was you. I could spot you a mile away, XX.
Dialogue||It's a much much happier day when I can see you, XX.
Dialogue||Sometimes I can't believe how quickly everything has changed.
Dialogue||Withergate? I'm too busy to worry about monsters.
Dialogue||How are you today, my muse?
Dialogue||You know XX, you could come visit me at my home sometime... if you wanted.
Dialogue||If I wanted to bring you a gift, what would you like?
Dialogue||Have you invited anyone to your house before?
Dialogue||There isn't much I need that I can't get myself, XX. You've seen my house, right?
Dialogue||Actually... huh, no I haven't. Congratulations on being the first, I guess.
Dialogue||I don't care!
Dialogue||I still think it would be nice.
Dialogue||Well, fine then. I can always use fresh food. In fact, it's been a while since I've had fresh cinaberry.
Dialogue||I'm honored!
Dialogue||It's weird that I'm the first.
Dialogue||I'm glad, but you don't have to make a big thing about it.
Dialogue||Well somebody has to be the first...
Dialogue||The farmer, hello again.
Dialogue||Have you worked with Lucia long?
Dialogue||So what exactly is your job?
Dialogue||You could say that. I was good friends with her grandparents, so I've known her since she was a young girl growing up here.
Dialogue||I'm the town administrator, meaning I take care of all the managerial business that Lucia is too busy to perform. I also officiate marriages, should anyone in town be so lucky.
Dialogue||Would you say you're friends?
Dialogue||So you knew her personally, before she was Archmage?
Dialogue||I suppose that's the right term. It feels almost like a guardianship, though I know she needs no guidance from me.
Dialogue||Still, I can't help but remember her as a child toddling around the town square in diapers.
Dialogue||Oh, please don't tell her I mentioned that. For obvious reasons, she hates when I bring that up.
Dialogue||When the day came that she became the town's Archmage, I couldn't believe it. I can still see her toddling around the town square in diapers, and now she leads all of Sun Haven.
Dialogue||Yes, I know her well. Her spirit is undefeatable. She will pull us out of the struggle we find ourselves in. And I have promised to help her the whole way.
Dialogue||Your work sounds important!
Dialogue||Are you bored with your job?
Dialogue||Indeed it is, even though it's entirely behind the scenes. However, I don't necessarily need recognition to make an impact on Sun Haven.
Dialogue||It sounds that boring to you? Good thing it's not your job then. I enjoy helping the town, so I enjoy my work.
Dialogue||You've really become a valuable part of our community, XX.
Dialogue||I just wanted to tell you that because I think it's important to let people know their value. It's good for morale!
Dialogue||Thanks Nathaniel, but my morale is just fine.
Dialogue||You seem to think about morale a lot.
Dialogue||Yeah, I can tell! You must be doing well on the farm, eh? Glad to see it, truly.
Dialogue||And I mean what I said, XX. Sun Haven wouldn't feel the same without you here.
Dialogue||Morale is our very best weapon, XX! A good mood keeps a soldier focused and gives them hope in a tight spot.
Dialogue||And if they never see a fight, then at least they enjoyed their day!
Dialogue||The farm is doing quite well, thanks!
Dialogue||I'm glad I can help with my farm.
Dialogue||It must be nice, working on a quiet farm all on your own. The barracks can feel a bit crowded sometimes. It would be nice to have some privacy...
Dialogue||Oh well, I'll get it one day. For now, it's duty through service as always.
Dialogue||This is why you're such a good leader.
Dialogue||That's childish, a good mood can't replace proper training.
Dialogue||Heh, well thanks! Not everyone in town sees the value in my leadership strategy. I appreciate your support, XX.
Dialogue||It's foolish of you to think that I would cut back on my soldiers' training for any reason. Trust me, each soldier in the Sun Haven Corps is a capable fighter.
Dialogue||Say, are you feeling okay XX? You look a little... I don't know. Preoccupied?
Dialogue||Ah, our future! Yes, let's plan for the future. Just, excuse me if I get a little fidgety. Thinking too far ahead gets me quite anxious, but you know that.
Dialogue||Am I happy? Do I seem sad? Oh sheesh, have I been worrying you or something? I'm sorry XX, I don't mean to give you any reason to doubt.
Dialogue||I'm <i>very</i> happy being with you, XX. Happier than I've ever been, actually.
Dialogue||I think we'll be together for a long time, Liam.
Dialogue||I might want to stay in Sun Haven for a long time.
Dialogue||Oh! Well thank goodness. That's actually nice to think about, XX. It isn't often I enjoy planning ahead, you know.
Dialogue||So would you want to be this happy, forever?
Dialogue||Oh... I see.
Dialogue||I'll help in any way I can. I just, uh, don't really know how to.
Dialogue||Forever... OH. Wow. Sorry XX, I'm just kind of caught off guard here.
Dialogue||But of course, I love the idea of being with you for as long as possible. If that means wearing a ring on my finger, then go ahead and give me the ring!
Dialogue||Er, I didn't mean right now. Just, whenever you're ready XX.
Dialogue||Gotta keep my claws sharp, nya!
Dialogue||Farming can be dangerous if you're using rusty old tools. I hope you're being safe!
Dialogue||Hey neighbor, you're looking fit! Is that from farming, or are you a health nut like me? Both, I bet.
Dialogue||Do you like delivering mail?
Dialogue||Doesn't it get tiring, being so healthy all the time?
Dialogue||Well I get to see everybody in town once a day and I get some great cardio out of it. I don't see any downside!
Dialogue||Sure it does, but being tired makes me happy. I never feel better than when my muscles are all sore from a really good workout.
Dialogue||You'll get bored of it sooner or later.
Dialogue||No wonder you're a great courier - you have a great attitude.
Dialogue||You don't know me very well, farmer.
Dialogue||It's true, your attitude does affect the job! That being said, I'd bet you're a top-notch farmer.
Dialogue||What's your favorite way to exercise?
Dialogue||Where do you usually work out in town?
Dialogue||I like running on the beach in the morning when the sun comes up. I imagine the sunrise is like my reward.
Dialogue||Hello, XX. Are you still getting used to Sun Haven? It takes some time.
Dialogue||Were you born in this town, Claude?
Dialogue||Are you worried about Sun Haven?
Dialogue||I'm from Sun Haven, but my family moved to the Great City a while back. I've actually lived most of my life there.
Dialogue||Why would I be? If the town goes under, I'll just move away. What's there to worry about?
Dialogue||So why are you here now?
Dialogue||I moved here from the Great City, too.
Dialogue||I moved back into town to get a little peace and quiet while I work.
Dialogue||We have that in common, then. I never want to set foot in that city again, if I'm being honest. So dirty and loud.
Dialogue||That's pretty cold hearted.
Dialogue||But what about the people in town?
Dialogue||If you say so. Anyway, I'm not here to save anyone.
Dialogue||I guess I see your point... the people have been good to me here. But that doesn't mean I can change anything.
Dialogue||One day, I'm going to be a rich merchant like Anne!
Dialogue||We've come so far together, XX. I think Sun Haven is really on the cusp of growing truly great.
Dialogue||Why are you always so concerned with Sun Haven?
Dialogue||I'm glad I get to share this time with you.
Dialogue||I gave my life to Sun Haven. It was part of answering a 'higher calling' for me.
Dialogue||I also gave my life to you, but I'll always have to balance between being the Archmage and being your wife.
Dialogue||There's no one else in the world I'd rather be with right now than you, XX.
Dialogue||We both worked very hard to turn Sun Haven around, and now we can watch the fruits of those labors together.
Dialogue||I understand, Lucia.
Dialogue||You need to commit to me more.
Dialogue||I know you do, XX. It's a big part of why I chose you to spend the rest of my life with. It isn't always the easiest, but I'll work hard to be a great wife. You'll see.
Dialogue||I know it won't always be the most ideal, but you're the one I chose to spend the rest of my life with. Just try with me and I think you'll see it will work.
Dialogue||Does this mean you'll take your job easier from now on?
Dialogue||I'm ready to work for the future with you, Lucia.
Dialogue||Not at all! If anything, I think we both have to work even harder from now on! Don't worry, I'm going to be right beside you the entire time. We'll do it together.
Dialogue||I'm ready, too, XX. If anything, I think we both have to work even harder from now on! Don't worry, I'm going to be right beside you the entire time. We'll do it together.
Dialogue||Maybe it's just Kitty, but Sun Haven smells even better than it used to!
Dialogue||Kitty thinks XX looks especially good today, nya!
Dialogue||Kitty, you're adorable but also kind of intense.
Dialogue||Do you feel okay? You look a little red.
Dialogue||I've heard that before, nya! I think it's a compliment. Do you like it?
Dialogue||I spent yesterday prowling the areas near your farm, nyaa. I wanted to protect it for you now that we're a couple! Maybe that's weird...Woops, tee hee. But the farm is safe, nya!
Dialogue||I wish you were more calm.
Dialogue||I love it - you make every day fun!
Dialogue||Calm? Ooh sorry XX, I thought you knew me better than that!
Dialogue||Oh, good! Not everyone thinks the same, but it doesn't bother me. Kitty has to be Kitty, after all!
Dialogue||Good to know it's safe, thanks Kitty!
Dialogue||You don't have to do that.
Dialogue||Nya! You're so very welcome! I have to protect you and your land, nya.
Dialogue||Plus it's fun! I get to chase off pesky squirrels and rabbits, teehee.
Dialogue||I know I don't <i>have</i> to, but I like to! I only want to help XX, like XX helps Kitty!
Dialogue||It's really nice, you know. Having a family again.
Dialogue||Sun Haven only gets more beautiful with each passing day. Don't you think so, XX?
Dialogue||You're not dating anyone, are you Lucia?
Dialogue||You really deserve to enjoy these beautiful days. Why don't we go on a date?
Dialogue||Oh no, not at the moment. I have precious little free time, so I prefer to wait until someone particularly special comes along. Although, I've certainly had my share of admirers.
Dialogue||I try to make time for myself, but it's difficult. There is always so much to be done.
Dialogue||Perhaps you're right. A date would be a nice break from my daily work!
Dialogue||That's no surprise to me!
Dialogue||It seems inappropriate for the Archmage to date their citizens.
Dialogue||Be careful now, you might make a lady blush! And don't think I haven't noticed how special you are, XX.
Dialogue||I suppose I see where you're coming from, but that doesn't leave me many options. XX, I'm afraid that simply makes no sense.
Dialogue||Then again, maybe this isn't a good idea.
Dialogue||Why don't you meet me in front of the town hall tomorrow at 5:00 pm?
Dialogue||We shouldn't do anything that makes you uncomfortable, XX.
Dialogue||I've been thinking about trying something... different. Maybe fishing?
Dialogue||I can't believe you want to try something that isn't music.
Dialogue||Trying something new might help you with your music.
Dialogue||Well, I feel like a new man. I'll never stop obsessing over my music, but maybe it's time to broaden my horizons. You're always doing all sorts of stuff, after all.
Dialogue||You know, I had a talk with Jun a while back, and he said something along the same lines. At the time I thought it was nonsense, but now that I've met you, I wonder...
Dialogue||You with a fishing rod, that'll be the day.
Dialogue||I think it's amazing you want to try new things.
Dialogue||I thought you'd be excited. This is... a sour surprise.
Dialogue||I knew you'd be excited. Maybe this is the start of a brand new Claude. With you, my muse.
Dialogue||Give it a go. It can't hurt.
Dialogue||Do what makes you comfortable.
Dialogue||You're right. Maybe it really will help. And at least I can say I tried, that'd make Jun happy if nothing else.
Dialogue||I was worried you'd push me really hard to give it a go, but it's nice that you're not breathing down my neck about it.
Dialogue||Not long ago, I thought Sun Haven had run out of surprises for me. Now I know just how wrong I was!
Dialogue||Are you saying I was the surprise?
Dialogue||Were you really getting bored here?
Dialogue||You were the biggest surprise of my life, XX. When I first saw you, it was like the world turned upside down.
Dialogue||Don't mince words, XX. I didn't say I was bored, only that there were no surprises left for me here.
Dialogue||I can see how you'd think those are the same things. But for me, I feel contentment instead of boredom.
Dialogue||It took me a while, but I got there too.
Dialogue||I felt the same exact way.
Dialogue||I see. I guess "love at first sight" isn't for everyone.
Dialogue||I know you did, XX. And now that we're married, well, we have the rest of our lives to surprise each other.
Dialogue||Maybe I should practice that, too.
Dialogue||You must get bored sometimes.
Dialogue||It does take a little practice, but I'm sure you could get it. The hardest part is to remember that being bored is okay and not inherently bad.
Dialogue||Some people avoid boredom like their lives depend on it. But I'll take a little boredom over meaningless distractions any day.
Dialogue||Well... one time I had to wait in line at the town hall for an hour while Albert asked questions about his property line. <i>That</i> was boring!
Dialogue||Another day in Sun Haven... sometimes the days here seem indistinguishable. But some days are special.
Dialogue||Special? Is today a special day, Claude?
Dialogue||Do you have any plans for the future, Claude?
Dialogue||I guess you could say that.
Dialogue||I'm not used to sharing myself with people, but there's something nice about it. So I want to share something with you, XX. It's the key to my house.
Dialogue||Future? I can't think that far ahead. I'm trying to focus completely on the present. It's the only way I can make music.
Dialogue||Are you sure? This seems important.
Dialogue||I don't know what to say, Claude.
Dialogue||Sure it is, the key to my house is like the key to my life. I want you to know that you're welcome in my life, XX. Here, take it.
Dialogue||If you never think of the future, then how will you make progress?
Dialogue||That's very fitting for you!
Dialogue||You obviously don't know what progress means to me.
Dialogue||It sounds like you mean that as a compliment, so thank you.
Dialogue||Walking around this town makes me think of all the great times I had growing up here.
Dialogue||What are your favorite memories from growing up?
Dialogue||Catherine, what's that in your basket there?
Dialogue||When we were quite young, all my siblings and I used to dig holes in the dirt to lay in on hot days. The digging was hard, but the cool dirt was worth it!
Dialogue||Oh right, I brought you something! Here, look - this is the strongest magic charm I've ever made. I know this can help you, XX. Try keeping it with you and you'll see!
Dialogue||I would hate to clean up after all those kids.
Dialogue||To deal with eight dirty kids at once, your parents must have been magic too.
Dialogue||Surprisingly, they didn't seem to mind. Getting dirty is just part of life, I guess.
Dialogue||This is so thoughtful, thanks Catherine.
Dialogue||It is important, so keep it safe! I think I can trust you, XX. Now it's up to you to prove it.
Dialogue||Treat it well, okay? I worked really hard to make it. I think I can trust you, XX. Now it's up to you to prove it.
Dialogue||You should know I'm never too busy to talk with you, XX.
Dialogue||Hey again, new farmer! I have to go care for my animals, but I'll look for you around town.
Dialogue||I'm a new man, XX. It's been a long time since I've felt so fearless!
Dialogue||You do seem to have a new energy about you.
Dialogue||When was the last time you felt this good?
Dialogue||I'm certain this strength is coming from you, XX. Thank you for being my support. You make me feel... frankly, invincible!
Dialogue||Why, it must have been when I was only a boy. My swearing-in as royal prince... I remember so clearly.
Dialogue||The castle was filled with Demons from all across the land who came to pay respects to me. The crown settled on my head, and at the same time every person in the hall bent their knees to me.
Dialogue||Don't forget, you're flesh and blood like the rest of us.
Dialogue||Together, we <i>are</i> invincible, Darius.
Dialogue||Why must you dampen my celebration? I'm rejoicing - and you should be, too.
Dialogue||Haha! You've captured my heart, XX. Nobody in this city - or this world, for that matter - has such influence over me as you have. For that, I feel blessed.
Dialogue||That kind of power sounds intoxicating.
Dialogue||I can't wait until you're king, Darius.
Dialogue||Patience, my sweet XX. One day, a crown will be settled onto your fine head and you will receive the same honor.
Dialogue||Lucia has asked me to compose a "town anthem" for Sun Haven. I'd like to decline, but she seemed really excited about it.
Dialogue||Do you not want to compose a town anthem for Sun Haven?
Dialogue||If Lucia asked you personally, she must really want you to do it.
Dialogue||Not especially, no. It's a quaint idea, but I just don't know what Lucia would be expecting. It seems like it's doomed to fail.
Dialogue||She does. She spoke a lot about "pride in Sun Haven" all that. I like living in Sun Haven, but I can't really see myself composing music in its honor.
Dialogue||You have a pretty sour attitude about it.
Dialogue||Try asking Lucia to clarify what she wants.
Dialogue||Oh well. Call it what you want, it's just how I feel.
Dialogue||That is one option, yes. If I'm really going to go through with this request, of course. I suppose at the very least I can ask her exactly what she wants from me.
Dialogue||If you aren't inspired then the music wouldn't be good, anyways.
Dialogue||Lucia asked you, so you should really try.
Dialogue||It's good you know me well enough to understand that I can't just force music to happen. I'll just have to explain that to Lucia next time we talk.
Dialogue||I can't just force myself to write music, XX. It doesn't work like that.
Dialogue||Oh, XX! I was thinking of pet names since we're dating now. I'm thinking something like, my little... sponge cake?
Dialogue||Eh, maybe it's better if I just stick with your real name.
Dialogue||I'll just call you Liam, anyway.
Dialogue||You look nervous. Are you nervous?
Dialogue||Heh, okay. At least that's settled.
Dialogue||I've never met anyone who was as patient with me as you are, XX. I mean, maybe Jun, but that's his job.
Dialogue||I'm sorry, it's just been a long time since I was in a relationship.
Dialogue||The last time was when I was a kid in school. This other kid called me their boyfriend, but I'm pretty sure it was just because I had cookies in my lunch bag.
Dialogue||Patient in what way?
Dialogue||You know I stumble over words here and there. I don't exactly have the social skills of Lucia or Nathaniel.
Dialogue||I'm just really, really lucky to have found someone like you, XX.
Dialogue||That's what attracted me to you, too.
Dialogue||I can't believe it's been that long for you.
Dialogue||Oh - you're kidding! Haha, see? I'm not always nervous. I totally got that you were joking. Totally joking.
Dialogue||I haven't exactly had a ton of time for dating since I started taking care of the girls.
Dialogue||Lucia honored me with a medal of recognition for my work the other day. Sorry, I'm not bragging, I'm just kind of touched, is all.
Dialogue||You totally deserved it.
Dialogue||So what's your medal look like?
Dialogue||You think so, too? I work real hard and everything, but I can't shake the feeling this honor could've gone to someone... more deserving. Did I really earn it?
Dialogue||Ah, it's really beautiful. I'd show it to you, but I've put it away for safekeeping.
Dialogue||It's a golden emblem with Elios' likeness carved into it, along with the words "FOR SERVICE TO SUN HAVEN."
Dialogue||Lucia's signature is also engraved on it, which is a nice touch.
Dialogue||Don't doubt yourself so much, you're doing great.
Dialogue||So you think Lucia made a mistake?
Dialogue||I know I shouldn't be down on myself, but sometimes it's hard... though if you and the Archmage are telling me I'm doing great, then maybe I should listen!
Dialogue||Heh, thanks for the shot of confidence, XX.
Dialogue||Lucia is a very wise Archmage, I never implied she was mistaken. I'm just not sure <i>why</i> it was me. Don't get the wrong idea, XX.
Dialogue||Sounds fancy.
Dialogue||You should frame it.
Dialogue||It's certainly a thing to behold. I still can't believe they chose me for it, really.
Dialogue||I may just have to do that one of these days. Right now I still can't believe they chose me for it, really.
Dialogue||I hope you're good at tag.
Dialogue||You look tired, XX. You need a cat nap, nya!
Dialogue||Hello! I'm Elizabeth. Who are you?
Dialogue||Farmer?? That's so cool! My brother is Liam, and he does the bakery.
Dialogue||Maybe when I'm grown like you, I'll have enough money to buy my own farm.
Dialogue||My sister Emma is the yuckiest. She makes me play in the dirt with her.
Dialogue||XX! I've been looking for you. Here, I brought you something to keep you strong.
Dialogue||I've been meaning to tell you... You have the most beautiful hair!
Dialogue||I was wondering... Did you put a romance spell on me??
Dialogue||Why thank you, XX! I know the best herbal remedies for healthy, vibrant hair. There's no magic involved at all!
Dialogue||Oh? You're just now thinking of this? Hm... Did I... Did I... I guess you'll never know!
Dialogue||That's unbelievable!
Dialogue||I don't believe that for a second.
Dialogue||Start believing XX, because it's true. If you stop by my house sometime, I could even show you my formula!
Dialogue||I can't tell if you're joking or... okay, you're serious. Wow, XX. Come on, I'm no liar.
Dialogue||Wait, I was only joking...
Dialogue||Now it sounds like you actually did!
Dialogue||Oh come on, XX. Of course I didn't! If you're feeling any kind of romance, then that's coming from you - and you can't blame me for that.
Dialogue||Greetings, XX. Now get out of my way.
Dialogue||I didn't mean to get in your way.
Dialogue||You seem cranky! Well, more than usual.
Dialogue||Regardless of your intent, you did it all the same. I'm busy right now with a task from my father... and I loathe being tasked with my father's demands.
Dialogue||Judge me all you want, but I have matters to tend to that go far above you. At any rate, I need not explain myself to the likes of you.
Dialogue||My father has his wishes, and it's up to me to respect them no matter what. Now like I said, get out of my way.
Dialogue||What's Minos got you doing?
Dialogue||You do look a bit stressed.
Dialogue||Firstly, it's King Minos to you. Secondly, it's not of your concern.
Dialogue||Then you should know that if there was ever a time to trifle with me, it is not now. Not that there's <i>ever</i> a time you should trifle with me.
Dialogue||Right this way, my prince.
Dialogue||That's no reason to be rude.
Dialogue||Heh, that's more like it. I'm just in a hurry, but I knew you had the wits to understand that.
Dialogue||I might count you as something akin to a confidant, XX, but if you become a problem... well, you know the drill. Dungeon. Chains. Eternity.
Dialogue||Now move aside.
Dialogue||Hm? Ah sorry XX, I've got my mind on a patient.
Dialogue||This town treats me well, and I treat it when it's not well!
Dialogue||Oh, hey there. I'm in the middle of planning next week's practice drills, but I can spare a moment to chat.
Dialogue||Is planning the drills usually your job?
Dialogue||What kind of stuff are you planning for practice?
Dialogue||Actually, it isn't. Our itinerary is normally received from Army Headquarters in the Great City.
Dialogue||Lately the headquarters has been failing to deliver, though. So I've been preparing the drills myself. It's no biggie, really.
Dialogue||Nothing out of the ordinary. Some running and conditioning exercises to keep everyone in top condition, especially when they have all their gear on.
Dialogue||Staying in good physical shape isn't just part of the job for me, I think it's a good lifestyle in general.
Dialogue||Why hasn't headquarters been doing their job?
Dialogue||Are you worried about headquarters not delivering?
Dialogue||I guess they're just a lot busier than usual these days. With all the rumors going around, I don't mind picking up the extra slack. It's my job, after all.
Dialogue||Hm, not really, no. I guess they're just a lot busier than usual these days. With all the rumors going around, I don't mind picking up the extra slack. It's my job, after all.
Dialogue||You have a tough job, you need to stay fit.
Dialogue||Sounds really mundane.
Dialogue||Hey, look who I'm talking to. If anyone knows about staying active and fit for their job, it's you.
Dialogue||I'm sorry you see it like that. I thought you'd relate, being a farmer and all, but maybe not.
Dialogue||Looking at you, I wonder if I should add farming to the soldiers' exercise regimen!
Dialogue||How are the other soldiers doing, anyway?
Dialogue||So who's the best fighter in the corps?
Dialogue||Oh, they're excelling in their exercises! Sophie is a real monster, and I mean that in a good way.
Dialogue||Pinto, on the other hand... well, he's got a lot of heart!
Dialogue||I'll exclude Roza since she's an officer, so that really just leaves Sophie. In fact, I'd say she's right on Roza's tail.
Dialogue||Watching the two of them spar is like watching an epic battle. Give it another year and Sophie could take Roza's title!
Dialogue||It sounds like Sophie will do well for herself in the military.
Dialogue||It sounds like Pinto has a lot of work to do...
Dialogue||Maybe, but there's more to being a leader than being good with a sword. She's still learning that part. Judging by her tenacity, she could make a great officer one day.
Dialogue||Maybe, but there's more to being a leader than being good with a sword. Judging by his morale, he could make a great officer one day.
Dialogue||I bet neither of them is on your level, though.
Dialogue||What if I told Roza you said that?
Dialogue||That's nice, but I'm actually not sure. Just because I'm the captain doesn't mean I'm the better fighter. In fact I might even bet against myself in that fight!
Dialogue||I wouldn't recommend that. She doesn't handle criticism well - it's part of what drives her to be the best.
Dialogue||My son will bring Withergate over the horizon. Monsterfolk will take their rightful place in the world.
Dialogue||Are you intimidated, little one? BWAHAHAH!
Dialogue||You're in the presence of a king. Be sure you don't forget yourself.
Dialogue||Now, what brings you before me?
Dialogue||I'm curious about Withergate's history, my king.
Dialogue||I want to add to Withergate's prosperity, my king.
Dialogue||Before Withergate was made a city, only Withergate Castle stood on this land. With the strength of my father, my son, and myself, Withergate Castle was pulled out of the very ground.
Dialogue||Soon after I took the throne, I knew it was time to spread my family's influence. I established Withergate City below the castle as a means of increasing my family's power.
Dialogue||I see... very good. I understand that you are a farmer in your Human town. Certainly you can use your experience raising crops to increase our bounty.
Dialogue||The apartments have farmable space on the rooftop where you can work. Xyla's genius idea, of course.
Dialogue||I thought you made Withergate to unify monsterfolk.
Dialogue||How did the monsterfolk come to be here?
Dialogue||At the time of Withergate's founding, there was indeed rising conflict among the monsterfolk. The unrest was a convenient problem, one that I was well-equipped to solve.
Dialogue||All the monsterfolk really needed was a call for unity from a powerful leader, and the enticing promise of everlasting darkness.
Dialogue||There was rising conflict among the monsterfolk at the time of Withergate's founding. The unrest was a convenient problem, one that I was well-equipped to solve.
Dialogue||Do you really think that will help much?
Dialogue||I'm happy to contribute however I can.
Dialogue||Questioning me is brash, outsider. Too brash. If you continue to slip up, I will let you rot in darkness for the rest of your miserable life.
Dialogue||You act like a true citizen of our beautiful city. Many are here only to live, not to help. If I'm to build a future for Demons and monsterfolk alike, then I'll need citizens like you.
Dialogue||Every Demon in the world will know the sweet taste of Withergate's prosperity, one day...
Dialogue||Ah, my newest citizen. What brings you before me today?
Dialogue||I want to know your family's history, my king.
Dialogue||My king, who is your most trusted advisor here?
Dialogue||My bloodline goes back one thousand years. I haven't enough time to give you a complete history, so I will tell you about my father.
Dialogue||My father, the king before me, was Aster. The Demon King Aster created Withergate Castle as a home for all demonkind. All that recognized my family's supremacy, that is.
Dialogue||Hm? I'm surprised you feel the need to ask. Surely you know that my son, Darius, acts as one of my advisors. I trust him over all others. Blood is thicker than water, you know.
Dialogue||Was he a good king?
Dialogue||He must have been a mighty ruler.
Dialogue||You <i>dare</i> suggest that my father was an unfit leader? Like all in my bloodline, he was born to lead peons such as yourself.
Dialogue||Next time, you will be sure to remember whose castle you're polluting with your insults.
Dialogue||Indeed. His wisdom and fearless leadership kept the Demons of Withergate Castle comfortable, safe, and happy.
Dialogue||Then who's your most trusted advisor, not counting Darius?
Dialogue||Does Darius do that good of a job?
Dialogue||That's Prince Darius to you, peasant. Show some respect in my throne room.
Dialogue||Other than Darius, I must choose Cordelia. Xyla has an enthusiasm and power that is valuable and rare, but she is too unpredictably wild. A king needs reliability on his council.
Dialogue||My son may not do the work of Cordelia or Xyla, but that is only because he carries the burden of royalty. Royalty has work done for them, not by them.
Dialogue||Once again, you come before me. I hope you're here with purpose and not only to waste my time.
Dialogue||My king, where is the rest of your family?
Dialogue||What are your plans for Withergate, my king?
Dialogue||Ah... You're curious about the queen. I suppose if you want to be a true citizen, then you should know the story. There was a battle, on this very land.
Dialogue||Darius was a mere child and my father was still king. I, the prince, was already long married to my queen-to-be, Aisling.
Dialogue||At that time the castle was not yet erected and we had only camps to live in. Then we fell under attack by a clan of Naga who wanted our land.
Dialogue||My Aisling fought fiercely, but was struck down.
Dialogue||Withergate City is my legacy to Darius. My plan is to make this city as grand and prosperous as possible. Then, when my son takes the throne, he will have the advantage of a city behind his rule.
Dialogue||I'm sorry for your loss.
Dialogue||It was after losing Aisling that my father decided to make the castle. It was that same night that he, with help from Darius and me, brought Withergate Castle into being.
Dialogue||That is kind of you to say. It was after losing Aisling that my father decided to make the castle. It was that same night that he, with help from Darius and me, brought Withergate Castle into being.
Dialogue||It sounds like your plan is to do nothing new.
Dialogue||Giving your son a strong start is a great idea.
Dialogue||As far as I know, Cordelia is my personal strategist. I will always be grateful for her advice, but a peasant like you has no right to criticise my plans for this city.
Dialogue||Indeed, it was Cordelia's idea to bide my time and make Withergate as great as it can be. She's a valuable strategist and a large part of Withergate's success.
Dialogue||If you wish to be one of us, you must prove your worth.
Dialogue||Withergate Castle is my father's legacy. Withergate City will be mine.
Dialogue||Hey, farmer. You're looking a little ragged. You must be working hard already.
Dialogue||How do you keep from burning yourself out?
Dialogue||Who works the hardest between the soldiers?
Dialogue||I get adequate sleep and I eat right. The occasional cold shower clears my head when I'm feeling groggy, too.
Dialogue||If we're excluding me - which I assume we are - then I'd actually say it's Sophie.
Dialogue||That girl has a fire inside her I haven't seen before. To be candid, I think she's trying to compete with me!
Dialogue||... That's it?
Dialogue||Good advice, thanks!
Dialogue||I see, you were hoping for a quick-fix, some kind of trick. Go talk to Lucia or Catherine if that's what you're after. I don't work magic.
Dialogue||I'm happy to help any way I can. That's the job, after all.
Dialogue||That's a good soldier!
Dialogue||You won't let her overtake you, right?
Dialogue||Darn right that is! She's quickly becoming my favorite. Maybe I'll even take little Sophie under my wing.
Dialogue||If she works hard enough to surpass me, then she's earned it. We reward good effort in the Sun Haven Corps.
Dialogue||... Not that she really stands a chance, anyway.
Dialogue||I love everything about my position... except for the barracks.
Dialogue||I would kill for my own living quarters!
Dialogue||Does Nathaniel get his own quarters?
Dialogue||What's your favorite meal that you can't get at the barracks?
Dialogue||Don't remind me. It's still in the barracks, but he gets a whole room to himself. Perks of being captain.
Dialogue||Hm, tough call. I'll say chicken salad because it's got everything my body needs.
Dialogue||You deserve those perks, too.
Dialogue||What's the army motto - "Duty through service?"
Dialogue||That's not a very military mindset, farmer. Once you start thinking things are unfair, you start to lose your nerve.
Dialogue||You get what you earn, and I haven't earned it yet. But I will.
Dialogue||That's right, farmer. And a good reminder to me.
Dialogue||I'll get my perks one day, but for now I have to do my duty.
Dialogue||Okay, but what about dessert?
Dialogue||Wow, you're even efficient when you eat.
Dialogue||I don't eat it often but... I can't resist chocolate ice cream. It's simply the perfect dessert.
Dialogue||You say that like it's a bad thing.
Dialogue||Stop by the barracks sometime if you want to practice your swordplay.
Dialogue||I got nothing to say!
Dialogue||Nathaniel has lots of charisma but he's not very organized.
Dialogue||Enjoying the day, farmer? It's beautiful weather to stand watch.
Dialogue||Do you get any time to relax?
Dialogue||You seem to take your position very seriously.
Dialogue||Sure, twenty minutes of relaxation time between dinner and sleep each night.
Dialogue||Why are you looking at me like that? That's plenty of time.
Dialogue||That's what I have to do if I want to climb the ranks. Not everyone has promotions dropped into their lap. Some of us need to work harder to go the same distance.
Dialogue||If you ask me, you could use more time off.
Dialogue||Would you ever want a whole day off for yourself?
Dialogue||Sure, when I retire. In the meantime, my routine keeps me on the level.
Dialogue||I'm just saying you could loosen up a bit.
Dialogue||You handle yourself well, even under all that pressure.
Dialogue||I'm not surprised that you don't get it.
Dialogue||I know that, but it's nice of you to say.
Dialogue||I know that one day I'll be leading the corps. For now, I just need to bide my time.
Dialogue||Hey, farmer. Stay safe, yeah?
Dialogue||My sword? Custom made.
Dialogue||Just cast your line and wait for the right moment. Patience is key!
Dialogue||Well don't just stand there - there's work to do.
Dialogue||Ulmus, gone for so long... until you brought him back. So good to have friends.
Dialogue||<b>Hmmmmm?</b>
Dialogue||Hm? Oh, you again. Hello, you again.
Dialogue||Birds sometimes live on me.
Dialogue||Beetles... beetles in my bark... No, no...
Dialogue||Hm... ?
Dialogue||Um, hello. I'm XX...
Dialogue||XX. Yes, the forest. You were there. Salix is my name.
Dialogue||I see when you look at me. Why?
Dialogue||Not to be rude, but where did you come from?
Dialogue||I don't mean to make you uncomfortable.
Dialogue||I come from here. From the dirt here.
Dialogue||Nobody makes me uncomfortable, especially not you.
Dialogue||So you just grew naturally?
Dialogue||Did you learn how to talk by yourself?
Dialogue||Mm, no. Not natural. I'm made this way by Iris. Nivara, too. They made me sprout and gave me thoughts. Happier this way.
Dialogue||You could call us friends!
Dialogue||I guess it means, "not happy."
Dialogue||Friends? Of course. Many here in Nel'Vari are my friend, such as Flemmett. You are a friend, too. Good, good!
Dialogue||Hmm? You don't want me to be happy? Hm, how sad...
Dialogue||<i>Grooooaaaan...</i>
Dialogue||Oh! Hello there. You're an interesting one, eh?
Dialogue||You can call me Eve. But what shall I call you?
Dialogue||You can call me XX.
Dialogue||Ah, the farmer! You must tell me all about it sometime. Farming, that is. And of course, I mean sometime other than now.
Dialogue||Every single person has something valuable to teach.
Dialogue||I'm not one to walk away from a challenge, even if it takes years to complete.
Dialogue||My mission is to spread knowledge and breed curiosity. What's yours?
Dialogue||You again! I hope I can interview you soon for your experience as a farmer. You could provide some useful information for my book.
Dialogue||You're writing a book?
Dialogue||So you're here doing research?
Dialogue||That's right, I'm calling it the Worldly Compendium. It will be a collection of, well, everything anybody knows about anything!
Dialogue||Yes, but I'm already halfway through this whole library. I hoped there would be a grander selection, but I know Sun Haven has been in a rough patch.
Dialogue||That sounds like a lot.
Dialogue||Is that possible?
Dialogue||Oh, sure. It will be the biggest reference book to ever exist by far, but it's worth the work.
Dialogue||Can you imagine, all the information you ever needed in one place? It's never been done before!
Dialogue||You're a fast worker!
Dialogue||Books aren't really a priority.
Dialogue||It's the nature of the work. It's also why I work alone, because nobody can keep up. Unfortunately, this also means I have to do all the work by myself.
Dialogue||I have to disagree! Books are vessels of knowledge. I don't believe there's ever a time when knowledge is not a priority.
Dialogue||My thoughts are constantly buzzing inside my head. Is it the same for you?
Dialogue||My Worldly Compendium will revolutionize the way we spread knowledge.
Dialogue||I have so many notes from my research that I can't even remember all of the topics, let alone the information.
Dialogue||Don't fight up close, keep your distance. You can't lose a fight if your opponent can't touch you.
Dialogue||Welcome back, traveler. Enjoying the fruits of Nel'Vari? Or, is this about business?
Dialogue||Where did you learn to make crossbows?
Dialogue||What's the best crossbow you've got?
Dialogue||I've been making crossbows since I was a young boy. Back then, they were hardly more than sticks and twine, but I assure you I've improved my craft.
Dialogue||That's my Mark, easily. I call it that because it hasn't missed a target yet. It's more of a relic now, though. Haven't needed to use that one in some time.
Dialogue||I can see that - I can't wait to try one out!
Dialogue||I'll believe it when I see it.
Dialogue||Heh, I see you appreciate quality gear. That makes sense for a traveler. And yet, you strike me as more than the average adventuring-type.
Dialogue||Anyway, I'm happy to help you however I can. Maybe one day you can help me out, too.
Dialogue||All right, don't take me at my word then. The evidence is right in front of you.
Dialogue||You don't use it anymore?
Dialogue||I used to fall into some dangerous work, in a previous lifetime. My Mark made a bit of a reputation for itself in my travels.
Dialogue||Heck, most people knew of "Rel'Tar's Mark" before they even knew me!
Dialogue||I only use the Mark when necessary. I used to fall into some dangerous work, in a previous lifetime. My Mark made a bit of a reputation for itself in my travels.
Dialogue||The finest capes made from the finest silk. I harvest it myself from wild centipillars and spider webs.
Dialogue||Life is good, XX.
Dialogue||Hm? Oh, hello. My name is Tornn, I sell capes here.
Dialogue||Hi Tornn, my name is XX. It's good to meet you.
Dialogue||Likewise, traveler.
Dialogue||I'm proud of the craftsmanship I put into each one of my crossbows. You'll feel the difference when you hold one, I guarantee it.
Dialogue||You look pretty stylish, but one of my capes would really pull your look together.
Dialogue||You strike me as a marksman. You've a sharp look in your eye.
Dialogue||I hope you're appreciating Nel'Vari, because not many strangers have the privilege of seeing our village.
Dialogue||Oh, you're back! So you're sticking around these parts? How exciting!
Dialogue||Did you want to talk about something?
Dialogue||You sure wear a lot of accessories!
Dialogue||If you want to protect nature, why do you sell animals here?
Dialogue||I've been known to accessorize. Every piece has a story, too.
Dialogue||The feather on my hat came from a mighty griffon that saved my life. And these earrings? I won them in an archery competition.
Dialogue||Souvenirs like these help me remember my blessings.
Dialogue||Great question, and one I love to answer!
Dialogue||Every little beast in this room is a rescue. Due to injury or abandonment, they couldn't make it on their own in the wild. But they will thrive in a controlled environment!
Dialogue||You've lived an exciting life.
Dialogue||It's important to remember our blessings.
Dialogue||When you live as long as Elves live, you're bound to end up with a story or two!
Dialogue||I couldn't have said it better myself. Glad to have you in Nel'Vari, XX.
Dialogue||Isn't it still wrong to own an animal?
Dialogue||You're a real hero!
Dialogue||If you can't see the difference between greed and kindness, then maybe you should have a chat with the World Dragon. She'll get your head on straight.
Dialogue||Ah! Heh, thank you XX! But I wouldn't say that about myself.
Dialogue||Ignoring a creature in need would be cruel. Way I see it, this is the least I can do.
Dialogue||My people are protective, but not inhospitable. You're certainly welcome here.
Dialogue||It's important that these gentle creatures find a loving home.
Dialogue||Is that a new outfit? Looking good!
Dialogue||I remember you, you're XX. Did you come looking for a cape, or just some conversation?
Dialogue||Do you make the capes yourself?
Dialogue||Have you always been a cape salesman?
Dialogue||From the finest silk I can forage, that's right. Of course I'm careful to make sure any spider webs are empty before I collect them. I don't want to steal anybody's home.
Dialogue||I used to do some jobs with Rel'Tar, but we've retired from that work now. I much prefer the peace and quiet of Nel'Vari to the action that goes on outside of the forest here.
Dialogue||You really care about the forest.
Dialogue||They're just spiders.
Dialogue||Spiders are a crucial part of the food chain, just like everything else. That might seem thoughtful to you, but for Elves it's a simple fact of life.
Dialogue||That shows how much you care about the forest, then. Spiders are a crucial part of the food chain.
Dialogue||Who were the jobs for?
Dialogue||It sounds like you were doing dangerous work.
Dialogue||We charged a hefty sum for our skills, since the work was often dangerous. So we were mostly hired by officials from other cities since they were the only ones who could afford us.
Dialogue||I can tell you're curious, so I'll say right up front that I don't care to dwell on those times. But I'll say this one thing about it - at the end of the day, all we did was help people.
Dialogue||You're right about the work being dangerous, but I really don't care to dwell on those times.
Dialogue||I can tell you're curious. I'll say this one thing about it - at the end of the day, all we did was help people.
Dialogue||Well-met, traveler. My name is Rel'Tar. I sell handcrafted crossbows, so if you're looking for arms then you've come to the right place.
Dialogue||Welcome to our village. It is rather impressive that you found your way here, I have to say.
Dialogue||Please, take your time to get to know the animals!
Dialogue||Hello, traveler. Long way from home, huh?
Dialogue||I used to travel the world like you, but my adventuring days are over. For now.
Dialogue||Why capes? They're useful and stylish, so there's no downside to a cape.
Dialogue||How's your aim? Just keep practicing.
Dialogue||It's my dream to make a beautiful cape for Nivara... but I would need so much silk, I don't know if it's possible.
Dialogue||Come in, come in!
Dialogue||Pleased to have you in my shop. Take a look around, get to know the animals!
Dialogue||Thank you! My name is XX, what's yours?
Dialogue||My name is Alfonse, but my friends call me Fonzo. So call me Fonzo!
Dialogue||Are you here to give one of these noble beasts a new home?
Dialogue||Nel'Vari itself is a natural sanctuary but I still help the animals when I can.

System.Boolean Wish.ANewHomeCutscene1/<SceneRoutine>d__5::MoveNext()||Hello. I'm here seeking the World Dragon.
System.Boolean Wish.ANewHomeCutscene1/<SceneRoutine>d__5::MoveNext()||Hoho, you mean Nivara, don't you?
System.Boolean Wish.ANewHomeCutscene1/<SceneRoutine>d__5::MoveNext()||...But of course you do. She is, after all, the only World Dragon, hoho.
System.Boolean Wish.ANewHomeCutscene1/<SceneRoutine>d__5::MoveNext()||But let us not get too ahead of ourselves, young one. Please allow me to make an introduction, if you will.
System.Boolean Wish.ANewHomeCutscene1/<SceneRoutine>d__5::MoveNext()||Sorry, I didn't mean to be rude.
System.Boolean Wish.ANewHomeCutscene1/<SceneRoutine>d__5::MoveNext()||Please, go ahead.
System.Boolean Wish.ANewHomeCutscene1/<SceneRoutine>d__5::MoveNext()||Hohoho, it will take much more than an adventurer making haste to necessitate an apology.
System.Boolean Wish.ANewHomeCutscene1/<SceneRoutine>d__5::MoveNext()||You do not need to explain anything, friend. We know of your intentions, and of their purity. The truth is that we have been expecting you.
System.Boolean Wish.ANewHomeCutscene1/<SceneRoutine>d__5::MoveNext()||Hoho, the eagerness of youth. I am glad it is still so infectious to me.
System.Boolean Wish.ANewHomeCutscene1/<SceneRoutine>d__5::MoveNext()||You will see Nivara in very short order, young adventurer. The truth is that we've been expecting you.
System.Boolean Wish.ANewHomeCutscene1/<SceneRoutine>d__5::MoveNext()||You've been expecting me?
System.Boolean Wish.ANewHomeCutscene1/<SceneRoutine>d__5::MoveNext()||The Sun Dragon has informed of us your coming, yes. It is not every day that a Guardian Dragon arrives to tell us that we should expect a visitor from a human town...
System.Boolean Wish.ANewHomeCutscene1/<SceneRoutine>d__5::MoveNext()||...Quite unexpected, really. Though, I wasn't going to be the one to argue with a dragon, hoho.
System.Boolean Wish.ANewHomeCutscene1/<SceneRoutine>d__5::MoveNext()||Alas, I will admit we did not know <i>who</i>  to expect, but now it seems clear to me that you have proven yourself as a worthy friend to Nel'Vari.
System.Boolean Wish.ANewHomeCutscene1/<SceneRoutine>d__5::MoveNext()||Who are you, anyways?
System.Boolean Wish.ANewHomeCutscene1/<SceneRoutine>d__5::MoveNext()||A fair question, more than deserving of an answer. I am Gorwin, the Elven Elder. I lead the people of Nel'Vari.
System.Boolean Wish.ANewHomeCutscene1/<SceneRoutine>d__5::MoveNext()||I am XX, a farmer from Sun Haven.
System.Boolean Wish.ANewHomeCutscene1/<SceneRoutine>d__5::MoveNext()||A farmer?
System.Boolean Wish.ANewHomeCutscene1/<SceneRoutine>d__5::MoveNext()||I see, I see. To us in Nel'Vari, farming is a very noble profession. It is a way of growing life, and mana... So glad I am to see you sprout from such honorable roots.
System.Boolean Wish.ANewHomeCutscene1/<SceneRoutine>d__5::MoveNext()||...XX, the journey to seek out our hidden city must have been a long one. Nivara waits for you, just a small distance beyond the Grand Tree. But if you would entertain an old Elf, however...
System.Boolean Wish.ANewHomeCutscene1/<SceneRoutine>d__5::MoveNext()||I would ask that you follow me. I have something I'd like to give to you.
System.Boolean Wish.ANewHomeCutscene1/<SceneRoutine>d__5::MoveNext()||What is it?
System.Boolean Wish.ANewHomeCutscene1/<SceneRoutine>d__5::MoveNext()||Hoho, consider it a welcoming gift. Please, follow me.
System.Boolean Wish.ANewHomeCutscene1/<SceneRoutine>d__5::MoveNext()||Alright... lead the way.
System.Boolean Wish.ANewHomeCutscene1/<SceneRoutine>d__5::MoveNext()||Is everything prepared for our guest, Wesley?
System.Boolean Wish.ANewHomeCutscene1/<SceneRoutine>d__5::MoveNext()||Of course, Elder Gorwin. I have prepared everything exactly to your specifications.
System.Boolean Wish.ANewHomeCutscene1/<SceneRoutine>d__5::MoveNext()||Although, I wonder if it's wise to give all of this to this... outsider.
System.Boolean Wish.ANewHomeCutscene1/<SceneRoutine>d__5::MoveNext()||They are no 'outsider' Wesley. They are our guest, and they have proven themselves a capable ally of the forest. Did you know they healed Ulmus?
System.Boolean Wish.ANewHomeCutscene1/<SceneRoutine>d__5::MoveNext()||I... what?! But Elder Gorwin, even our best infusers failed to...
System.Boolean Wish.ANewHomeCutscene1/<SceneRoutine>d__5::MoveNext()||Hmph. Very well. This was an impressive feat.
System.Boolean Wish.ANewHomeCutscene1/<SceneRoutine>d__5::MoveNext()||I'm sorry, Elder, did you say they mended that wounded guardian? The dormant one?
System.Boolean Wish.ANewHomeCutscene1/<SceneRoutine>d__5::MoveNext()||That is correct. An infusion of mana the likes that few of us could match. It had gotten so out of hand I thought I should need to request Iris herself to mend Ulmus.
System.Boolean Wish.ANewHomeCutscene1/<SceneRoutine>d__5::MoveNext()||Though XX here proved more than up to the task, saving our Enchantress precious time.
System.Boolean Wish.ANewHomeCutscene1/<SceneRoutine>d__5::MoveNext()||Wow, that's impressive! XX rocks!!
System.Boolean Wish.ANewHomeCutscene1/<SceneRoutine>d__5::MoveNext()||I had not thanked you properly for that, actually. So now I shall. Thank you, XX. That was a service that I shall never forget.
System.Boolean Wish.ANewHomeCutscene1/<SceneRoutine>d__5::MoveNext()||Yeah... thanks for that.
System.Boolean Wish.ANewHomeCutscene1/<SceneRoutine>d__5::MoveNext()||You're welcome, Elder.
System.Boolean Wish.ANewHomeCutscene1/<SceneRoutine>d__5::MoveNext()||You're welcome, Wesley.
System.Boolean Wish.ANewHomeCutscene1/<SceneRoutine>d__5::MoveNext()||Hoho, I am glad to know that my thanks is appreciated.
System.Boolean Wish.ANewHomeCutscene1/<SceneRoutine>d__5::MoveNext()||...Hmph.
System.Boolean Wish.ANewHomeCutscene1/<SceneRoutine>d__5::MoveNext()||Anyways, before we go further, perhaps I should introduce the others here? XX, this is Wesley. He is my Assistant, and he provides an invaluable service to Nel'Vari.
System.Boolean Wish.ANewHomeCutscene1/<SceneRoutine>d__5::MoveNext()||I tasked him with ensuring the farm was prepared for you.
System.Boolean Wish.ANewHomeCutscene1/<SceneRoutine>d__5::MoveNext()||And this is Lily. It appears she invited herself to the excitement on the farm, hoho.
System.Boolean Wish.ANewHomeCutscene1/<SceneRoutine>d__5::MoveNext()||Teehee! Hello there, XX!
System.Boolean Wish.ANewHomeCutscene1/<SceneRoutine>d__5::MoveNext()||...Greetings.
System.Boolean Wish.ANewHomeCutscene1/<SceneRoutine>d__5::MoveNext()||Perhaps we should speed things up a bit, don't you think, everyone?
System.Boolean Wish.ANewHomeCutscene1/<SceneRoutine>d__5::MoveNext()||XX, this farm and the home on it are now yours, and you may do with them as you please to fit your comfort.
System.Boolean Wish.ANewHomeCutscene1/<SceneRoutine>d__5::MoveNext()||Use this as a place to further yourself and grow in power as you receive Nivara's teachings.
System.Boolean Wish.ANewHomeCutscene1/<SceneRoutine>d__5::MoveNext()||You farmed in the Human town, right? It will be exciting to see what you do with the place!
System.Boolean Wish.ANewHomeCutscene1/<SceneRoutine>d__5::MoveNext()||Utilizing this land is the least you can do, considering how much work we put into getting it ready for you.
System.Boolean Wish.ANewHomeCutscene1/<SceneRoutine>d__5::MoveNext()||There is no need to worry, Wesley. I am sure our new friend will do just that. And of course, no farmer can grow anything if they do not have seeds! Here, XX, take these.
System.Boolean Wish.ANewHomeCutscene1/<SceneRoutine>d__5::MoveNext()||Show us your aptitude for farming, won't you? Plant and tend to these acorn seeds, so they might grow into a harvest.
System.Boolean Wish.ANewHomeCutscene1/<SceneRoutine>d__5::MoveNext()||If you need anything, there's a chest full of old farming equipment near the house! They might not be the best quality, but they'll do the trick if you don't have anything better.
System.Boolean Wish.ANewHomeCutscene1/<SceneRoutine>d__5::MoveNext()||Alright, let's get to work.
System.Boolean Wish.ANewHomeCutscene2/<SceneRoutine>d__5::MoveNext()||A good show, XX! I have to admit, I worked up quite the sweat watching you, hoho. On behalf of all of us in Nel'Vari, please utilize this farm as you see fit. I look forward to what you make of this forest as you settle in.
System.Boolean Wish.ANewHomeCutscene2/<SceneRoutine>d__5::MoveNext()||So interesting to see how someone outside of Nel'Vari farms! XX is so quick! Mmm!
System.Boolean Wish.ANewHomeCutscene2/<SceneRoutine>d__5::MoveNext()||Is everything alright, Wesley?
System.Boolean Wish.ANewHomeCutscene2/<SceneRoutine>d__5::MoveNext()||Yes, Elder...
System.Boolean Wish.ANewHomeCutscene2/<SceneRoutine>d__5::MoveNext()||Excellent! Then, for now, I will leave you to get familiar with your new farm. XX, I know you are eager to seek out Nivara, but do not fear, the tree guardians have already notified her of your arrival. For now, you may focus on settling in.
System.Boolean Wish.ANewHomeCutscene2/<SceneRoutine>d__5::MoveNext()||And whenever you are ready, please meet me at the top of the Grand Tree, at the north end of town. Wesley, of course, will be happy to receive you and show you the way to the World Dragon.
System.Boolean Wish.ANewHomeCutscene2/<SceneRoutine>d__5::MoveNext()||Wesley, are you sure you are alright?
System.Boolean Wish.ANewHomeCutscene2/<SceneRoutine>d__5::MoveNext()||Yes... Elder. I'm fine.
System.Boolean Wish.ANewHomeCutscene2/<SceneRoutine>d__5::MoveNext()||Excellent, again! XX, Lily can get you better acquainted with your new farm. As a matter of fact, she happens to know quite a lot about many things, such as farming, barn animals, mounts, creatures, crafts, arts...
System.Boolean Wish.ANewHomeCutscene2/<SceneRoutine>d__5::MoveNext()||...mining, fishing, capes, crossbows, medicines, squirrels, elemental sprites, mushrooms, dragons, and even centipillars.
System.Boolean Wish.ANewHomeCutscene2/<SceneRoutine>d__5::MoveNext()||Hoho... But for now, please take a few days to fully learn and experience your new home here in Nel'Vari. Wesley and I have much to do to help the World Dragon prepare for your training.
System.Boolean Wish.ANewHomeCutscene2/<SceneRoutine>d__5::MoveNext()||Come Wesley, we have work to do!
System.Boolean Wish.ANewHomeCutscene3/<SceneRoutine>d__2::MoveNext()||XX, let's check out your new farm! I would guess it's a little different from your farm back in Sun Haven, mmm!
System.Boolean Wish.ANewHomeCutscene3/<SceneRoutine>d__2::MoveNext()||How do you know I'm from Sun Haven?
System.Boolean Wish.ANewHomeCutscene3/<SceneRoutine>d__2::MoveNext()||It can't be that much different.
System.Boolean Wish.ANewHomeCutscene3/<SceneRoutine>d__2::MoveNext()||The Sun Dragon told Nivara and the Elder that a friend from the town of Sun Haven would visit us. All I know about Sun Haven is that it's a Human town, which means it must be pretty different from Nel'Vari!
System.Boolean Wish.ANewHomeCutscene3/<SceneRoutine>d__2::MoveNext()||All I know about Sun Haven is that it's a Human town, which means it must be pretty different from Nel'Vari!
System.Boolean Wish.ANewHomeCutscene3/<SceneRoutine>d__2::MoveNext()||Like the Elder said, the soil here in Nel'Vari is extra fertile, and we grow fantastic crops you won't find anywhere else. In fact, <b>seeds from anywhere else won't even grow here</b>!
System.Boolean Wish.ANewHomeCutscene3/<SceneRoutine>d__2::MoveNext()||Why wouldn't they grow?
System.Boolean Wish.ANewHomeCutscene3/<SceneRoutine>d__2::MoveNext()||The dirt of the forest is rich with mana energy. If you planted anything else here, the mana would practically drown it. Just like if you watered it with too much water.
System.Boolean Wish.ANewHomeCutscene3/<SceneRoutine>d__2::MoveNext()||But don't worry. There's still plenty of things you can grow. And all of them will be loaded with mana, which is great for growing lively things! Here, follow me.
System.Boolean Wish.ANewHomeCutscene3/<SceneRoutine>d__2::MoveNext()||See this alcove? The animals of the forest are all friends to Nel'Vari. It seems that <i>if you grow a crop that a certain animal likes</i>, then those animals <i>will be attracted to one of the alcoves</i>.
System.Boolean Wish.ANewHomeCutscene3/<SceneRoutine>d__2::MoveNext()||The more you grow of their favorite crop, the more of those animals will be attracted, mmm! So if you want lots of animals, grow lots of their favorite crop.
System.Boolean Wish.ANewHomeCutscene3/<SceneRoutine>d__2::MoveNext()||Remember that not every crop attracts animals though, okay? Oh, and if you <i>harvest the crop, the animals will run off back into the forest</i>! If you leave the crops in the ground, then the animals will stay!
System.Boolean Wish.ANewHomeCutscene3/<SceneRoutine>d__2::MoveNext()||How did you figure all that out?
System.Boolean Wish.ANewHomeCutscene3/<SceneRoutine>d__2::MoveNext()||Hehe, well, I tried out a little bit of farming. I could never manage to get anything more than acorns to grow, but when I grew them, squirrels came to visit, mmm!
System.Boolean Wish.ANewHomeCutscene3/<SceneRoutine>d__2::MoveNext()||I'm excited to see what you might attract to the farm.
System.Boolean Wish.ANewHomeCutscene3/<SceneRoutine>d__2::MoveNext()||Speaking of animals, though, you can also buy farm animals to live here. There's an Elf in town sells them - when you travel to town, just look for the Elf in the funny hat and all the cute animals... you won't be able to miss them!
System.Boolean Wish.ANewHomeCutscene3/<SceneRoutine>d__2::MoveNext()||What about the big griffin over there?
System.Boolean Wish.ANewHomeCutscene3/<SceneRoutine>d__2::MoveNext()||The griffon I am not so sure of. He was here when we started getting the farm ready for you. Wesley tried to shoo him off, but the griffon didn't seem to notice.
System.Boolean Wish.ANewHomeCutscene3/<SceneRoutine>d__2::MoveNext()||Griffons can be very stubborn, but he isn't in the way of anything at least, mm..
System.Boolean Wish.ANewHomeCutscene3/<SceneRoutine>d__2::MoveNext()||Why are griffons so stubborn?
System.Boolean Wish.ANewHomeCutscene3/<SceneRoutine>d__2::MoveNext()||I've heard tales that griffons are very proud. If you earn the favor of one, it will be a lifelong friend to you. Wesley sure tried everything, though, and the griffon never seemed to care.
System.Boolean Wish.ANewHomeCutscene3/<SceneRoutine>d__2::MoveNext()||Maybe I'll try to get its attention.
System.Boolean Wish.ANewHomeCutscene3/<SceneRoutine>d__2::MoveNext()||Now that I'd like to see! Wesley was sure the griffon couldn't be moved, but I have a feeling you might prove him wrong about that.

System.Boolean Wish.BarracksIntro3_Crossbow/<SceneRoutine>d__3::MoveNext()||You're a natural with that thing! But I wonder, how good are you at a distance? Try shooting the dummy 5 times with this crossbow.

System.Boolean Wish.LynnHangoutCutscene1/<SceneRoutine>d__2::MoveNext()||You can tell? Oh... Is that why you invited me out? On second thought, please don't answer that.
System.Boolean Wish.LynnHangoutCutscene1/<SceneRoutine>d__2::MoveNext()||You know, I'm glad you moved here so soon after me. This way, it's less like I'm the outsider trying to fit in.

System.Boolean Wish.LynnHangoutCutscene1/<SceneRoutine>d__2::MoveNext()||I have been hard at work on the farm.
System.Boolean Wish.LynnHangoutCutscene1/<SceneRoutine>d__2::MoveNext()||I've been keeping busy outside of the farm.

System.Boolean Wish.LynnHangoutCutscene1/<SceneRoutine>d__2::MoveNext()||Maybe someone else would do a better job than me. Solon is a master, after all. He could apprentice anyone in the world.
System.Boolean Wish.LynnHangoutCutscene1/<SceneRoutine>d__2::MoveNext()||I just don't feel like I deserve to be here. Am I thinking about it too much, or did I really make a mistake?

System.Boolean Wish.NivarasLessonGrowthCutscene3/<SceneRoutine>d__18::MoveNext()||The infusion of these mana gems is a sacred tradition in Nel'Vari, and it can only be properly completed with a truly massive amount of mana.
System.Boolean Wish.NivarasLessonGrowthCutscene3/<SceneRoutine>d__18::MoveNext()||XX, Did you need to borrow some muscles? I've come to help you. Hah.
System.Boolean Wish.NivarasLessonGrowthCutscene3/<SceneRoutine>d__18::MoveNext()||I would never miss the opportunity to be a part of something as special as this. I am glad to help you, XX.
System.Boolean Wish.NivarasLessonGrowthCutscene3/<SceneRoutine>d__18::MoveNext()||What do we need to do?
System.Boolean Wish.NivarasLessonGrowthCutscene3/<SceneRoutine>d__18::MoveNext()||So how will this work, exactly?
System.Boolean Wish.NivarasLessonGrowthCutscene3/<SceneRoutine>d__18::MoveNext()||All you must do is infuse the crystals as you would anything else. However, it will not be merely your own energy. Iris and Vaan will be there with you.
System.Boolean Wish.NivarasLessonGrowthCutscene3/<SceneRoutine>d__18::MoveNext()||Your energy can not overpower or be overpowered. It must all flow together, balanced. Do you all understand?
System.Boolean Wish.NivarasLessonGrowthCutscene3/<SceneRoutine>d__18::MoveNext()||I have it under control, XX. Just do your best, alright?
System.Boolean Wish.NivarasLessonGrowthCutscene3/<SceneRoutine>d__18::MoveNext()||I think we are capable of that, yes.
System.Boolean Wish.NivarasLessonGrowthCutscene3/<SceneRoutine>d__18::MoveNext()||Let's try our best, everyone.
System.Boolean Wish.NivarasLessonGrowthCutscene3/<SceneRoutine>d__18::MoveNext()||We can do it, no sweat.
System.Boolean Wish.NivarasLessonGrowthCutscene3/<SceneRoutine>d__18::MoveNext()||Combine your powers, and let it bring growth.
System.Boolean Wish.NivarasLessonGrowthCutscene3/<SceneRoutine>d__18::MoveNext()||Is it working?
System.Boolean Wish.NivarasLessonGrowthCutscene3/<SceneRoutine>d__18::MoveNext()||Our infusions were very closely balanced. We may need more help.
System.Boolean Wish.NivarasLessonGrowthCutscene3/<SceneRoutine>d__18::MoveNext()||We can do it, let's try again.
System.Boolean Wish.NivarasLessonGrowthCutscene3/<SceneRoutine>d__18::MoveNext()||Who else is there to help?
System.Boolean Wish.NivarasLessonGrowthCutscene3/<SceneRoutine>d__18::MoveNext()||Hello, XX... I figured my help would be needed.
System.Boolean Wish.NivarasLessonGrowthCutscene3/<SceneRoutine>d__18::MoveNext()||Wesley! You're here to help?
System.Boolean Wish.NivarasLessonGrowthCutscene3/<SceneRoutine>d__18::MoveNext()||We do need some help, come on over.
System.Boolean Wish.NivarasLessonGrowthCutscene3/<SceneRoutine>d__18::MoveNext()||...I would be...
System.Boolean Wish.NivarasLessonGrowthCutscene3/<SceneRoutine>d__18::MoveNext()||...<i>Honored</i>  to help you with this ceremony.
System.Boolean Wish.NivarasLessonGrowthCutscene3/<SceneRoutine>d__18::MoveNext()||Three has become four. Try again, and infuse the the flower with your energy.
System.Boolean Wish.NivarasLessonGrowthCutscene3/<SceneRoutine>d__18::MoveNext()||Would you look at that? We did it.
System.Boolean Wish.NivarasLessonGrowthCutscene3/<SceneRoutine>d__18::MoveNext()||Well done, all of you.
System.Boolean Wish.NivarasLessonGrowthCutscene3/<SceneRoutine>d__18::MoveNext()||Each of you see the world in very different ways, but by putting yourselves together you were able to achieve something truly remarkable.
System.Boolean Wish.NivarasLessonGrowthCutscene3/<SceneRoutine>d__18::MoveNext()||Was there something you wanted to say, Wesley?
System.Boolean Wish.NivarasLessonGrowthCutscene3/<SceneRoutine>d__18::MoveNext()||...Fine.
System.Boolean Wish.NivarasLessonGrowthCutscene3/<SceneRoutine>d__18::MoveNext()||Thank you, XX. The growing of these mana crystals is an important piece of Nel'Vari's culture and history now and...
System.Boolean Wish.NivarasLessonGrowthCutscene3/<SceneRoutine>d__18::MoveNext()||...and... it's important to me, too. So thank you.
System.Boolean Wish.NivarasLessonGrowthCutscene3/<SceneRoutine>d__18::MoveNext()||You're welcome, Wesley.
System.Boolean Wish.NivarasLessonGrowthCutscene3/<SceneRoutine>d__18::MoveNext()||Don't mention it.
System.Boolean Wish.NivarasLessonGrowthCutscene3/<SceneRoutine>d__18::MoveNext()||What was accomplished here could not have been done without all of you. If just one of you were missing, then the others would have all failed. Well done, I am proud of you all.
System.Boolean Wish.NivarasLessonGrowthCutscene3/<SceneRoutine>d__18::MoveNext()||Iris and Vaan... Thank you both for the help.
System.Boolean Wish.NivarasLessonGrowthCutscene3/<SceneRoutine>d__18::MoveNext()||Now, I would like to say a few things to Wesley and XX.
System.Boolean Wish.NivarasLessonGrowthCutscene3/<SceneRoutine>d__18::MoveNext()||Yes, Nivara. Thank you everyone for this, it was good to be part of it.
System.Boolean Wish.NivarasLessonGrowthCutscene3/<SceneRoutine>d__18::MoveNext()||<i>(Vaan says nothing, but winks with a smirk before quietly taking his leave.)</i>
System.Boolean Wish.NivarasLessonGrowthCutscene3/<SceneRoutine>d__18::MoveNext()||XX, when you came to Nel'Vari and stood before me, I told you that Elios believed there was an incredible potential inside of you.
System.Boolean Wish.NivarasLessonGrowthCutscene3/<SceneRoutine>d__18::MoveNext()||I think you have more than proven his belief correct. You have done very, very well and I am very proud.
System.Boolean Wish.NivarasLessonGrowthCutscene3/<SceneRoutine>d__18::MoveNext()||Thank you, Nivara.
System.Boolean Wish.NivarasLessonGrowthCutscene3/<SceneRoutine>d__18::MoveNext()||Wesley, some day you will be Elder. When XX first arrived, you had problems accepting their presence in Nel'Vari.
System.Boolean Wish.NivarasLessonGrowthCutscene3/<SceneRoutine>d__18::MoveNext()||...Yes, World Dragon Nivara...
System.Boolean Wish.NivarasLessonGrowthCutscene3/<SceneRoutine>d__18::MoveNext()||But you have grown much. Take this growth to heart, and continue to nurture it. Do this, and you will make a great Elder when the time comes.
System.Boolean Wish.NivarasLessonGrowthCutscene3/<SceneRoutine>d__18::MoveNext()||I understand... thank you, World Dragon Nivara.
System.Boolean Wish.NivarasLessonGrowthCutscene3/<SceneRoutine>d__18::MoveNext()||And... thank you, XX.
System.Boolean Wish.NivarasLessonGrowthCutscene3/<SceneRoutine>d__18::MoveNext()||XX, I now wish to ask one more thing of you.
System.Boolean Wish.NivarasLessonGrowthCutscene3/<SceneRoutine>d__18::MoveNext()||What is it, Nivara?
System.Boolean Wish.NivarasLessonGrowthCutscene3/<SceneRoutine>d__18::MoveNext()||What now?
System.Boolean Wish.NivarasLessonGrowthCutscene3/<SceneRoutine>d__18::MoveNext()||Please, close your eyes, and clear your mind. I wish for you to receive my blessing.
System.Boolean Wish.NivarasLessonGrowthCutscene3/<SceneRoutine>d__18::MoveNext()||It is done. Elios spoke truly, there <i>is</i>  an energy about you, strange and familiar...
System.Boolean Wish.NivarasLessonGrowthCutscene3/<SceneRoutine>d__18::MoveNext()||Now, remember my lessons and let them guide and grow you further. And while I have no more immediate lessons for you, if ever you need my wisdom, please come speak to me again.
System.Boolean Wish.NivarasLessonGrowthCutscene3/<SceneRoutine>d__18::MoveNext()||Good luck in your adventures forward, XX. I trust in you, and know that there is no darkness you cannot overcome.
System.Boolean Wish.NivarasLessonGrowthCutscene3/<SceneRoutine>d__18::MoveNext()||Thank you for teaching me, Nivara.
System.Boolean Wish.NivarasLessonGrowthCutscene3/<SceneRoutine>d__18::MoveNext()||Thank you for your blessing.
System.Boolean Wish.NivarasLessonPerspectiveCutscene1/<SceneRoutine>d__2::MoveNext()||Little sprout, shall we begin your first lesson?
System.Boolean Wish.NivarasLessonPerspectiveCutscene1/<SceneRoutine>d__2::MoveNext()||I am ready, Nivara.
System.Boolean Wish.NivarasLessonPerspectiveCutscene1/<SceneRoutine>d__2::MoveNext()||Very well... in nature, all things operate under a set of key principles. Life is a push and a pull of factors that work with and against one another, but in the end they all find a balance.
System.Boolean Wish.NivarasLessonPerspectiveCutscene1/<SceneRoutine>d__2::MoveNext()||I want to impart <color=#39CCFF>three lessons</color> upon you. This will be the first.
System.Boolean Wish.NivarasLessonPerspectiveCutscene1/<SceneRoutine>d__2::MoveNext()||Do not worry, XX. All of Nel'Vari shall help you to learn each of these lessons... in a forest, no one tree grows alone.
System.Boolean Wish.NivarasLessonPerspectiveCutscene1/<SceneRoutine>d__2::MoveNext()||Nel'Vari will teach me?
System.Boolean Wish.NivarasLessonPerspectiveCutscene1/<SceneRoutine>d__2::MoveNext()||Do I really need all of Nel'Vari's help?
System.Boolean Wish.NivarasLessonPerspectiveCutscene1/<SceneRoutine>d__2::MoveNext()||All living things have their own perspectives, it is part of what makes you who you are.
System.Boolean Wish.NivarasLessonPerspectiveCutscene1/<SceneRoutine>d__2::MoveNext()||Understanding one's own perspective is important, but it is also important to understand the perspective of others. So, little sprout, the first lesson of balance is <i>perspective</i>.
System.Boolean Wish.NivarasLessonPerspectiveCutscene1/<SceneRoutine>d__2::MoveNext()||Nel'Vari is built upon this principle and many of its citizens reflect that... just as you will, when our lesson is complete.
System.Boolean Wish.NivarasLessonPerspectiveCutscene1/<SceneRoutine>d__2::MoveNext()||I understand.
System.Boolean Wish.NivarasLessonPerspectiveCutscene1/<SceneRoutine>d__2::MoveNext()||That seems like a very big concept.
System.Boolean Wish.NivarasLessonPerspectiveCutscene1/<SceneRoutine>d__2::MoveNext()||<i>(Nivara inclines her head towards you. It suddenly feels as if a wave of tranquility were washing upon you.)</i>
System.Boolean Wish.NivarasLessonPerspectiveCutscene1/<SceneRoutine>d__2::MoveNext()||That is good to hear, XX. This lesson should be all the easier if you already understand this much.
System.Boolean Wish.NivarasLessonPerspectiveCutscene1/<SceneRoutine>d__2::MoveNext()||Two of my brightest pupils live here in Nel'Vari. One is Iris, the Enchantress whose enchantments brought life to the tree guardians.
System.Boolean Wish.NivarasLessonPerspectiveCutscene1/<SceneRoutine>d__2::MoveNext()||The second is Vaan, the Air Mage whose magic helped construct the Wind Lift.
System.Boolean Wish.NivarasLessonPerspectiveCutscene1/<SceneRoutine>d__2::MoveNext()||Both have a perspective on the world outside Nel'Vari, though they are greatly the opposite of one another.
System.Boolean Wish.NivarasLessonPerspectiveCutscene1/<SceneRoutine>d__2::MoveNext()||I have asked the two ask something of you that would demonstrate their perspectives. Seek them out and learn their perspectives.
System.Boolean Wish.NivarasLessonPerspectiveCutscene1/<SceneRoutine>d__2::MoveNext()||That is okay, XX. I believe by the time your lesson is complete, you will come to understand fully.
System.Boolean Wish.NivarasLessonPerspectiveCutscene1/<SceneRoutine>d__2::MoveNext()||Sure thing, Nivara.
System.Boolean Wish.NivarasLessonPerspectiveCutscene1/<SceneRoutine>d__2::MoveNext()||You got it.
System.Boolean Wish.NivarasLessonPerspectiveCutscene2/<SceneRoutine>d__2::MoveNext()||Welcome back, XX. How was your time with Iris and Vaan?
System.Boolean Wish.NivarasLessonPerspectiveCutscene2/<SceneRoutine>d__2::MoveNext()||Vaan pranked me... but Elder Gorwin sends his greetings.
System.Boolean Wish.NivarasLessonPerspectiveCutscene2/<SceneRoutine>d__2::MoveNext()||<i>(You think you catch the faintest glimpse of a grin in the World Dragon's eyes, though her compsure remains otherwise completely intact.)</i>
System.Boolean Wish.NivarasLessonPerspectiveCutscene2/<SceneRoutine>d__2::MoveNext()||Have I passed the lesson?
System.Boolean Wish.NivarasLessonPerspectiveCutscene2/<SceneRoutine>d__2::MoveNext()||What do I have to do now?
System.Boolean Wish.NivarasLessonPerspectiveCutscene2/<SceneRoutine>d__2::MoveNext()||First I wish to ask you one more thing, XX.
System.Boolean Wish.NivarasLessonPerspectiveCutscene2/<SceneRoutine>d__2::MoveNext()||What is your perspective? Should Nel'Vari stay elusive and hidden, or should Nel'Vari open itself to the world?
System.Boolean Wish.NivarasLessonPerspectiveCutscene2/<SceneRoutine>d__2::MoveNext()||I think Nel'Vari should open itself up.
System.Boolean Wish.NivarasLessonPerspectiveCutscene2/<SceneRoutine>d__2::MoveNext()||I think Nel'Vari should remain hidden.
System.Boolean Wish.NivarasLessonPerspectiveCutscene2/<SceneRoutine>d__2::MoveNext()||I see. Opening oneself to the world comes with many possibilities for opportunity, but also risk.
System.Boolean Wish.NivarasLessonPerspectiveCutscene2/<SceneRoutine>d__2::MoveNext()||I wonder if you would have answered the same way had I asked you before you began this lesson.
System.Boolean Wish.NivarasLessonPerspectiveCutscene2/<SceneRoutine>d__2::MoveNext()||Please reflect on what those you have spoken to have told you. Try to understand <i>their</i> perspective.
System.Boolean Wish.NivarasLessonPerspectiveCutscene2/<SceneRoutine>d__2::MoveNext()||I see. By staying concealed, you can better assure your safety, but it is also important to understand what you give up...
System.Boolean Wish.NivarasLessonPerspectiveCutscene2/<SceneRoutine>d__2::MoveNext()||I think that I understand.
System.Boolean Wish.NivarasLessonPerspectiveCutscene2/<SceneRoutine>d__2::MoveNext()||You have done well, little sprout, and your first lesson is complete. I hope you now understand the importance of perspective.
System.Boolean Wish.NivarasLessonPerspectiveCutscene2/<SceneRoutine>d__2::MoveNext()||Now then, when you are prepared to learn the next lesson, come seek me again.
System.Boolean Wish.NivarasLessonPerspectiveCutscene2/<SceneRoutine>d__2::MoveNext()||Yes, Nivara.
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene1/<SceneRoutine>d__1::MoveNext()||You're back for that Nel'Vari text? Lucia has informed me of your express permission to view the text and unfortunately I can't really argue with her.
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene1/<SceneRoutine>d__1::MoveNext()||Alright, I'll go get the book and you can take a look at it.
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene1/<SceneRoutine>d__1::MoveNext()||Thank you, Amanda.
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene1/<SceneRoutine>d__1::MoveNext()||Just be quick about it.
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene1/<SceneRoutine>d__1::MoveNext()||Yeah, yeah. It's my job, after all.
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene1/<SceneRoutine>d__1::MoveNext()||...Alright, here it is. Whew, it really <i>is</i>  old. Let's see what it says.
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene1/<SceneRoutine>d__1::MoveNext()||Impatient, are we? I'll pretend that's just because you're such an eager reader.
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene1/<SceneRoutine>d__1::MoveNext()||...Yup, I don't understand a single word in this book. How about you?
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene1/<SceneRoutine>d__1::MoveNext()||It looks like gibberish.
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene1/<SceneRoutine>d__1::MoveNext()||I have no idea what this says.
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene1/<SceneRoutine>d__1::MoveNext()||It isn't 'gibberish', they're words... albeit written in another language. Looks like you went through all that trouble for a book neither of us can read. Heh, isn't that funny?
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene1/<SceneRoutine>d__1::MoveNext()||I could have guessed as much. Well, looks like you went through all that trouble for a book neither of us can read. Heh, isn't that funny?
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene1/<SceneRoutine>d__1::MoveNext()||Well, I think it's funny.
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene1/<SceneRoutine>d__1::MoveNext()||I really need to know what this book says.
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene1/<SceneRoutine>d__1::MoveNext()||Alright, don't lose your hair. I have no idea what this says, but I do know of an Elf who lives here in Sun Haven. He's almost always drinking at the tavern.
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene1/<SceneRoutine>d__1::MoveNext()||He's definitely not from Nel'Vari or anything like that, but maybe you can go find him and see if he's able to make sense of this. It's worth a shot, at least.
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene1/<SceneRoutine>d__1::MoveNext()||I'll go speak to him.
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene10/<SceneRoutine>d__5::MoveNext()||Try if you wish... but his sleep is deep...
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene10/<SceneRoutine>d__5::MoveNext()||A stranger...? Why do you stand before me?
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene10/<SceneRoutine>d__5::MoveNext()||I'm searching for the town of Nel'Vari. Are you guarding the entrance?
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene10/<SceneRoutine>d__5::MoveNext()||Hmm, so you know of Nel'Vari? It is down this very path... but only a friend of the forest may pass. Are you friend?
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene10/<SceneRoutine>d__5::MoveNext()||I am XX. I was sent by Elios, the Sun Dragon.
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene10/<SceneRoutine>d__5::MoveNext()||Maybe you were, or maybe you were not...
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene10/<SceneRoutine>d__5::MoveNext()||Are you a <i>friend</i>  to Nel'Vari? How does the forest know that you come with peace? How can you... prove it?
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene10/<SceneRoutine>d__5::MoveNext()||How can I prove I'm a friend to Nel'Vari?
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene10/<SceneRoutine>d__5::MoveNext()||Tell me... who you really are.
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene10/<SceneRoutine>d__5::MoveNext()||I'm XX, I'm a farmer.
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene10/<SceneRoutine>d__5::MoveNext()||Who are <i>you</i>?
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene10/<SceneRoutine>d__5::MoveNext()||You farm? Hm, farming is good... You are a farmer, and I am a guardian... I guard this path.
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene10/<SceneRoutine>d__5::MoveNext()||What does the farmer want in Nel'Vari?
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene10/<SceneRoutine>d__5::MoveNext()||I am a guardian, and I guard this path.
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene10/<SceneRoutine>d__5::MoveNext()||What do you want in Nel'Vari?
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene10/<SceneRoutine>d__5::MoveNext()||I have come here to train with the World Dragon.
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene10/<SceneRoutine>d__5::MoveNext()||The World Dragon... Nivara. She rests at her shrine in Nel'Vari. Only a true friend of the Elves may pass to see her.
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene10/<SceneRoutine>d__5::MoveNext()||You still don't believe I'm a friend?
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene10/<SceneRoutine>d__5::MoveNext()||It is... a difficult question to answer. My friend always saw the other side of things, but he is sleeping... dormant and silent.
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene10/<SceneRoutine>d__5::MoveNext()||Sleeping?
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene10/<SceneRoutine>d__5::MoveNext()||We are of the trees. The Elves of Nel'Vari made us. Mana fuels us... but there is so little left these days... My friend had no mana. Had to... sleep.
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene10/<SceneRoutine>d__5::MoveNext()||I hear no more voices from the trees without him. I am... alone.
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene10/<SceneRoutine>d__5::MoveNext()||I see. Maybe I can help your friend.
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene10/<SceneRoutine>d__5::MoveNext()||No... I don't think you can. Can you?
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene10/<SceneRoutine>d__5::MoveNext()||Let's just see about that.
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene11/<SceneRoutine>d__7::MoveNext()||An impressive effort, but I do not believe it worked... his slumber is too deep.
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene11/<SceneRoutine>d__7::MoveNext()||I think I see him moving.
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene11/<SceneRoutine>d__7::MoveNext()||I am awake. Awake again, now.
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene11/<SceneRoutine>d__7::MoveNext()||Ulmus... friend. You have awoken?
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene11/<SceneRoutine>d__7::MoveNext()||Indeed, yes. Someone... gave me mana. Who?
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene11/<SceneRoutine>d__7::MoveNext()||It was this one, here... XX.
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene11/<SceneRoutine>d__7::MoveNext()||You have infused me, "XX"? Stranger... thank you.
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene11/<SceneRoutine>d__7::MoveNext()||Ulmus friend, your perspective is needed now. XX seeks the path to Nel'Vari.
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene11/<SceneRoutine>d__7::MoveNext()||Ah... A different perspective.
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene11/<SceneRoutine>d__7::MoveNext()||Each tree only sees the world from one perspective... Yet truth lays in having many. Hmm...
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene11/<SceneRoutine>d__7::MoveNext()||Shall XX pass?
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene11/<SceneRoutine>d__7::MoveNext()||You really still don't believe me?
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene11/<SceneRoutine>d__7::MoveNext()||Please, let me through.
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene11/<SceneRoutine>d__7::MoveNext()||Only a true friend of the forest would expend one's own mana to give to another. XX, you are a friend of the forest.
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene11/<SceneRoutine>d__7::MoveNext()||You're saying I can pass?
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene11/<SceneRoutine>d__7::MoveNext()||Does this mean I can pass?
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene11/<SceneRoutine>d__7::MoveNext()||You shall pass. I will notify the Elder immediately.
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene11/<SceneRoutine>d__7::MoveNext()||Thank you.
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene2/<SceneRoutine>d__1::MoveNext()||*hic*- Eh? Farmer? I sense you aren't here to make smalltalk. What can I do for you?
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene2/<SceneRoutine>d__1::MoveNext()||I need some Nel'Varian text translated. Can you help me?
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene2/<SceneRoutine>d__1::MoveNext()||You speak Nel'Varian, right?
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene2/<SceneRoutine>d__1::MoveNext()||Heh, <i>*hic*</i>. That's awful presumptuous of ya, farmer. You think just because I'm an Elf that means I speak Nel'Vari?
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene2/<SceneRoutine>d__1::MoveNext()||You're an Elf too, aren't ya? So why can't you speak Nel'Varian, huh? Us Elves have many different cultures, and Nel'Varians are as about as different as can be.
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene2/<SceneRoutine>d__1::MoveNext()||Real secluded and stuck in 'the old ways', them ones are. Me? My family comes from a quiet fishin' village right outside the Great city, heh.
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene2/<SceneRoutine>d__1::MoveNext()||What I'm saying to you, farmer, is that I can't <i>*hic*</i> help ya.

System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene3/<SceneRoutine>d__1::MoveNext()||I'm sorry, but <i>what</i>?! Not only does the <color=#39CCFF>Stone of Tongues</color> actually <i>exist</i>,  but Anne is planning on <i>selling it</i>?!
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene3/<SceneRoutine>d__1::MoveNext()||...I'm sorry, XX. Just... give me a moment to wrap my head around this.
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene3/<SceneRoutine>d__1::MoveNext()||Ah, forget about it. Let's see if this magic rock actually works.
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene3/<SceneRoutine>d__1::MoveNext()||Well, now that we at least know <i>what</i>  it says, maybe someone can give us some context on it? I would try talking to Edwin again, maybe he knows what it means.
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene3/<SceneRoutine>d__1::MoveNext()||Not like you have to listen to me, though.
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene3/<SceneRoutine>d__1::MoveNext()||As for the stone, I'll take it back to Anne for you. I'd love to give her my thoughts on her "business plan".
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene3/<SceneRoutine>d__1::MoveNext()||Sounds like my best chance, I guess.
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene4/<SceneRoutine>d__1::MoveNext()||Mari
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene4/<SceneRoutine>d__1::MoveNext()||What's that, hun? Did Edwin really con ya into taking care of his bar tab for him? Well, I won't stick my nose into your business or anything like that.
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene4/<SceneRoutine>d__1::MoveNext()||All I'm really concerned with is that his tab gets taken care of, really. If you're really gonna do it, then it's all the same to me!
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene4/<SceneRoutine>d__1::MoveNext()||How much does he owe?
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene4/<SceneRoutine>d__1::MoveNext()||I'll get the gold, don't worry.
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene4/<SceneRoutine>d__1::MoveNext()||Well, here's the thing, dear... it isn't "how much" he owes, so much as it is "what" he owes...
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene4/<SceneRoutine>d__1::MoveNext()||When Edwin opened the tab with us, instead of paying in coin, he promised he'd cultivate some special <color=#39CCFF>Elven grapes</color> as payment.
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene4/<SceneRoutine>d__1::MoveNext()||Elven grapes?
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene4/<SceneRoutine>d__1::MoveNext()||You mean I can't pay you in coins?
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene4/<SceneRoutine>d__1::MoveNext()||That's right, it's grapes. I wanted to try my hand at fermenting my own wine! So the aspect of doing that with some special Elven grapes was very exciting.
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene4/<SceneRoutine>d__1::MoveNext()||Sadly, since opening this tab, he's failed to grow even a single vine for me! You're a farmer... so I guess maybe you can handle it instead.
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene4/<SceneRoutine>d__1::MoveNext()||Makes no difference to me who grows 'em, at least. I just want my grapes!
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene4/<SceneRoutine>d__1::MoveNext()||Let me see about that.
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene4/<SceneRoutine>d__1::MoveNext()||I'll talk to Edwin.
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene5/<SceneRoutine>d__1::MoveNext()||<i>*hic*</i>. Well hello, farmer. Let me guess, you've got more grapes than you can carry and you're ready to pay off that tab?
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene5/<SceneRoutine>d__1::MoveNext()||I planted the grapes but they died. What happened?
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene5/<SceneRoutine>d__1::MoveNext()||Eh? Is that so? <i>*hic*</i>. Well, you know, now that I think about it... these grapes need more than just water. You have to <i>infuse em' with some manners</i>, too.
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene5/<SceneRoutine>d__1::MoveNext()||Don't you mean "mana"?
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene5/<SceneRoutine>d__1::MoveNext()||Yeah, yeah, that's what I said! Manners!
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene5/<SceneRoutine>d__1::MoveNext()||It's why I can't grow the stinkin' things! With you being the talk of the town, with your fancy 'Sun Dragon Blessing', I thought you'd know just what to do...
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene5/<SceneRoutine>d__1::MoveNext()||But ah, isn't that how life goes?
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene5/<SceneRoutine>d__1::MoveNext()||So, you wanna learn how to infuse manas? Maybe the Archmaster or Archmaze or whatever you call her- ya know...
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene5/<SceneRoutine>d__1::MoveNext()||The red haired Human girl? If anyone could help you out <i>*hic*</i> I bet it's her. I know it isn't me, heh...
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene5/<SceneRoutine>d__1::MoveNext()||I'll see if Lucia can help me, then.
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene6/<SceneRoutine>d__6::MoveNext()||Just give it a try, XX. You can do it, I know you can.
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene6/<SceneRoutine>d__6::MoveNext()||Hello, XX. Are you ready to learn about mana infusion?
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene6/<SceneRoutine>d__6::MoveNext()||Thanks for helping me.
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene6/<SceneRoutine>d__6::MoveNext()||Let's do it!
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene6/<SceneRoutine>d__6::MoveNext()||Don't mention it, XX! I help you to help me help Sun Haven. Hehe, get it?
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene6/<SceneRoutine>d__6::MoveNext()||I like your spirit, XX. It reminds me of many of Sun Haven's past leaders.
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene6/<SceneRoutine>d__6::MoveNext()||Now let me start by putting it like this...
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene6/<SceneRoutine>d__6::MoveNext()||Mana exists in every living thing. Every plant and animal, even you and I! Whenever you cast a spell or use magic, you draw on the mana inside of you to power that act.
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene6/<SceneRoutine>d__6::MoveNext()||Does that make sense so far?
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene6/<SceneRoutine>d__6::MoveNext()||Well, when you cast a spell, you pull mana up through you and release it in the form of spell you've chosen to use.
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene6/<SceneRoutine>d__6::MoveNext()||I understand.
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene6/<SceneRoutine>d__6::MoveNext()||That... makes sense, I think.
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene6/<SceneRoutine>d__6::MoveNext()||Just don't think of it too hard. Mana is a natural part of everything, and for those of us like you and me, it is an extension of our very essence.
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene6/<SceneRoutine>d__6::MoveNext()||Hehe, sorry. I hope I'm explaining this all correctly. I'm trying to remember the things my grandfather told me when he trained me.
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene6/<SceneRoutine>d__6::MoveNext()||I'll try to be a good student.
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene6/<SceneRoutine>d__6::MoveNext()||You'll do just fine.
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene6/<SceneRoutine>d__6::MoveNext()||Just try to relax, XX. I know you'll do just fine.
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene6/<SceneRoutine>d__6::MoveNext()||When it comes to infusing mana, imagine it like casting a spell... but without the part where you discharge the energy at the end. Instead, draw the mana up through you, and hold it.
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene6/<SceneRoutine>d__6::MoveNext()||Life is a sponge and mana is water... So when you draw mana up, life around you will naturally draw that mana in.
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene6/<SceneRoutine>d__6::MoveNext()||Thank you for the vote of confidence, XX. My grandfather left a legacy of knowlegde that I plan to continue.
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene6/<SceneRoutine>d__6::MoveNext()||I'm a little lost.
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene6/<SceneRoutine>d__6::MoveNext()||I'm not sure I understand.
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene6/<SceneRoutine>d__6::MoveNext()||I thought it might be a little difficult to understand. It's okay, XX. I think you'll find it easier to grasp if you actually give it a try.
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene6/<SceneRoutine>d__6::MoveNext()||Here, do you see this potted flower? It has long since wilted, but with mana you can revitalize it.
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene6/<SceneRoutine>d__6::MoveNext()||Try and see if you can concentrate your mana to infuse this plant. I know it is a very large concept, but try to think of it like the smooth motion of a simple task... like swinging your axe, or maybe like pushing a button.
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene6/<SceneRoutine>d__6::MoveNext()||You'll know if it worked, believe me. Now try your focus, XX.
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene7/<SceneRoutine>d__6::MoveNext()||Wow... you did it. So quickly, too. I guess I shouldn't be surprised, but I can't help myself. Very well done, XX!
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene7/<SceneRoutine>d__6::MoveNext()||That's all there is to it?
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene7/<SceneRoutine>d__6::MoveNext()||That's the basic idea, yes. Infusing mana is more than just a menial task, though. It's the sharing of energy, and life. At least that's what my grandfather said about it.
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene7/<SceneRoutine>d__6::MoveNext()||And he was right about that- mana is energy! If you're feeling low on it, eating food is a great way to refuel.
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene7/<SceneRoutine>d__6::MoveNext()||So if you ever plan on using a lot of mana, be sure to bring plenty of food. Have you ever watched a group of people work at casting a spell and then break for a snack? There's so many dirty plates afterwards! Hehe.
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene7/<SceneRoutine>d__6::MoveNext()||The last thing I will share is that a single mana infusion will not drain much of your mana, but be aware that multiple infusions can very quickly add up.
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene7/<SceneRoutine>d__6::MoveNext()||If I had to estimate how much energy one infusion takes, I would say... <color=#00bfff>'5' mana</color>. Does that all make sense?
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene7/<SceneRoutine>d__6::MoveNext()||I think I've got the hang of it.
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene7/<SceneRoutine>d__6::MoveNext()||Excellent. Here, I want to give you these. They're <color=#39CCFF>mana potions</color>! They'll help keep your mana full even as you expend it. They were certainly a big help to me when I was learning to infuse mana. Good luck. //Emote none Happy

System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene8/<SceneRoutine>d__1::MoveNext()||Eh? You again, farmer? Look, I was a little hazy earlier when I told you to grow those grapes. I know you can't actually grow them, I was just...

System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene8/<SceneRoutine>d__1::MoveNext()||But the truth is, farmer, the poem... really doesn't mean anything. It's just a simple Elven poem.
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene8/<SceneRoutine>d__1::MoveNext()||I don't understand how that helps me.
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene8/<SceneRoutine>d__1::MoveNext()||You're telling me I did all this for nothing?
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene8/<SceneRoutine>d__1::MoveNext()||Well it wasn't all for nothing, farmer.
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene8/<SceneRoutine>d__1::MoveNext()||I know the Nel'Varians hold the ancient ways of the Elves, a connection with nature, in deep regard. Only those who understand that will ever be able to enter their city.
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene8/<SceneRoutine>d__1::MoveNext()||If anything proves you have that connection with nature, it definitely ain't no bedtime poem- It's your ability to grow grapes like these.
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene8/<SceneRoutine>d__1::MoveNext()||Yeah... I'd wager they'd let you in, no doubt.
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene8/<SceneRoutine>d__1::MoveNext()||I'm glad to hear that.
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene8/<SceneRoutine>d__1::MoveNext()||I guess that makes sense.
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene8/<SceneRoutine>d__1::MoveNext()||Hah, see? Chin up, farmer. You did good.
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene8/<SceneRoutine>d__1::MoveNext()||Now, you should go on and find the ancient lost city of the Nel'Vari Elves. As for me... I think I'll open a new tab, heh...
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene8/<SceneRoutine>d__1::MoveNext()||Thanks, I think.

System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene9/<SceneRoutine>d__4::MoveNext()||I don't want to take up too much of your time, XX. I simply wanted to commend you before you head out to find Nel'Vari.

System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene9/<SceneRoutine>d__4::MoveNext()||You seem to be doing much to ensure the safety of Sun Haven, XX. You have the thanks of me and everyone else here today inside the barracks... and outside of the barracks, too. So... more than just me and Lucia. -ahem-.

System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene9/<SceneRoutine>d__4::MoveNext()||XX, you're doing something that no one in Sun Haven history has done before. Just remember to stay safe and be careful. The forests of the west are not well charted or mapped, and no one can tell for certain what you might face.
System.Boolean Wish.PathToNelvariCutscene9/<SceneRoutine>d__4::MoveNext()||Several of my men have scouted into the western forests. They've told me that the trees begin to turn to a strange and vibrant color, and they feel a strange presence on the wind.

System.Boolean Wish.TheWorldDragonCutscene5/<SceneRoutine>d__2::MoveNext()||Hello, World Dragon.
System.Boolean Wish.TheWorldDragonCutscene5/<SceneRoutine>d__2::MoveNext()||Hello, Nivara.
System.Boolean Wish.TheWorldDragonCutscene5/<SceneRoutine>d__2::MoveNext()||Greetings. I have awaited your arrival ever since Elios told me of your coming. The road that led here was not an easy one, though you traversed it safely. You have an admirable tenacity.
System.Boolean Wish.TheWorldDragonCutscene5/<SceneRoutine>d__2::MoveNext()||I am Nivara, the World Dragon. My home is here, among the Elves of Nel'Vari. They are my friends, but I also count them as my family.
System.Boolean Wish.TheWorldDragonCutscene5/<SceneRoutine>d__2::MoveNext()||I would consider you the same, XX, if you would only allow me to see your innermost self.
System.Boolean Wish.TheWorldDragonCutscene5/<SceneRoutine>d__2::MoveNext()||Are you going to ask me questions?
System.Boolean Wish.TheWorldDragonCutscene5/<SceneRoutine>d__2::MoveNext()||If you are willing to answer, XX.
System.Boolean Wish.TheWorldDragonCutscene5/<SceneRoutine>d__2::MoveNext()||I am ready.
System.Boolean Wish.TheWorldDragonCutscene5/<SceneRoutine>d__2::MoveNext()||Go ahead and ask.
System.Boolean Wish.TheWorldDragonCutscene5/<SceneRoutine>d__2::MoveNext()||Thank you, XX. Please, clear your mind and answer me with your truest feelings.
System.Boolean Wish.TheWorldDragonCutscene5/<SceneRoutine>d__2::MoveNext()||XX, what has brought you to Nel'Vari?
System.Boolean Wish.TheWorldDragonCutscene5/<SceneRoutine>d__2::MoveNext()||Elios guided me here.
System.Boolean Wish.TheWorldDragonCutscene5/<SceneRoutine>d__2::MoveNext()||I wanted to see the city of Nel'Vari.
System.Boolean Wish.TheWorldDragonCutscene5/<SceneRoutine>d__2::MoveNext()||I'm here to get stronger..
System.Boolean Wish.TheWorldDragonCutscene5/<SceneRoutine>d__2::MoveNext()||A sense of duty to the Sun Dragon, I see. A willingness to do what has been asked... it is the cornerstone to building any society, or any friendship.
System.Boolean Wish.TheWorldDragonCutscene5/<SceneRoutine>d__2::MoveNext()||I just want to make the world a better place.
System.Boolean Wish.TheWorldDragonCutscene5/<SceneRoutine>d__2::MoveNext()||I don't do things just because I'm asked to.
System.Boolean Wish.TheWorldDragonCutscene5/<SceneRoutine>d__2::MoveNext()||That is the purest sense of duty of them all, XX.
System.Boolean Wish.TheWorldDragonCutscene5/<SceneRoutine>d__2::MoveNext()||I am beginning to see why Elios saw such potential in you.
System.Boolean Wish.TheWorldDragonCutscene5/<SceneRoutine>d__2::MoveNext()||Acts do not need to be entirely selfless to be beneficial. You seem to realize that one person's victory can be a victory for all.
System.Boolean Wish.TheWorldDragonCutscene5/<SceneRoutine>d__2::MoveNext()||What do you see in me, Nivara?
System.Boolean Wish.TheWorldDragonCutscene5/<SceneRoutine>d__2::MoveNext()||I see. A desire to see the world and take in the different people and cultures within it. In my long life I have found that oftentimes the wisest mind is the one that has been left open to the world.
System.Boolean Wish.TheWorldDragonCutscene5/<SceneRoutine>d__2::MoveNext()||Is that why you came to us?
System.Boolean Wish.TheWorldDragonCutscene5/<SceneRoutine>d__2::MoveNext()||I heard Nel'Vari was full of incredible things.
System.Boolean Wish.TheWorldDragonCutscene5/<SceneRoutine>d__2::MoveNext()||It is a near impossibility to experience the world and not be moved to better all the people and places you encounter. You seem to know this well, XX.
System.Boolean Wish.TheWorldDragonCutscene5/<SceneRoutine>d__2::MoveNext()||There are many who hear the tales of Nel'Vari, yet they never search for it. You allowed your curiosity to lead you to a new place.
System.Boolean Wish.TheWorldDragonCutscene5/<SceneRoutine>d__2::MoveNext()||I see. You wish to grow, just as all life does. No matter what you live for, we are all connected on a deep and basic level... a desire to make ourselves better.
System.Boolean Wish.TheWorldDragonCutscene5/<SceneRoutine>d__2::MoveNext()||Can you make me stronger?
System.Boolean Wish.TheWorldDragonCutscene5/<SceneRoutine>d__2::MoveNext()||The power to change the world starts with the power to change one's self. You will grow stronger, and as you do, you will be able to make the world ever better.
System.Boolean Wish.TheWorldDragonCutscene5/<SceneRoutine>d__2::MoveNext()||Only you can make yourself stronger, XX. I can guide you and help nurture your growing power, though you have done very well on your own so far.
System.Boolean Wish.TheWorldDragonCutscene5/<SceneRoutine>d__2::MoveNext()||Like Elios, I see much potential in you.
System.Boolean Wish.TheWorldDragonCutscene5/<SceneRoutine>d__2::MoveNext()||Potential is a seed that must be nurtured... all of Nel'Vari that you see around you was no more than seeds before they were nurtured to growth.
System.Boolean Wish.TheWorldDragonCutscene5/<SceneRoutine>d__2::MoveNext()||If you wish to receive my lessons, I will teach them to you. Just as a tree that grows grand and strong, you will grow too, little sprout.

System.Boolean Wish.TheWorldDragonCutscene5/<SceneRoutine>d__2::MoveNext()||I see all of my pupils as sprouts, eager to grow and learn.

System.Boolean Wish.TrainIntroCutscene/<SceneRoutine>d__12::MoveNext()||I've heard there's a city full of monsters out there. People haven't been traveling as much because they're afraid of monsters on the road. I don't know if it's true, though.
System.Boolean Wish.TrainIntroCutscene/<SceneRoutine>d__12::MoveNext()||I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to ruin the conversation. I'm sure Sun Haven is safe and sound.

All of Nel'Vari can be seen from this vantage point. No wonder they built the council room here.
It looks like some kind of ceremonial tea set. It's been kept in super good condition, despite likely being quite old.
A beautifully cut gem, it's absolutely breathtaking. Whoever cut this must be a master at the craft.
Papers full of handwritten notes concerning Nel'Vari heritage and customs. Is someone writing a book about Nel'Vari's history?

Dynus' Altar Room
The magazine is open to a page with a recipe for <color=#39CCFF>moon cream pie</color>.
There seems to be a feature article by someone named "The Savvy Swordsman."
They've ranked swords from best to worst: <color=#39CCFF>copper sword</color>, <color=#39CCFF>iron sword</color>, <color=#39CCFF>adamant sword</color>, <color=#39CCFF>mithril sword</color>, <color=#39CCFF>sunite sword</color>.
The magazine is open to a page full of pictures of glittering <color=#39CCFF>diamonds</color>. They all seem to be individually circled.

Big boy seems to have hurt his leg. At least he's in good hands.
The shelves are crammed tightly with texts concerning the medical treatment of every animal imaginable, along with recipe books for all types of cookies.
One of the books is called "Snaccoons, Nature's Gentle Giant: A Guide to Healing and Helping these Furry Friends." Looks like it has seen a lot of use.
Still warm and gooey from the oven. If these don't help you feel better then what else possibly could?
Take a Whiff
It appears to be an array of medicine, though a closer inspection reveals it's actually ingredients for baking cookies.
Ah, a helpful first aid kit! No doubt full of useful supplies for treating your injuries... aaand it's full of cookies and nothing else.
It looks super comfy, but there are cookie crumbs scattered all through the faux fur.
Crate upon crate, all stuffed full of crossbow bolts.
Looks like Rel'Tar still enjoys some target practice.
Some kind of shrine, whatever was inscribed on the stone has worn away. How old must this be?
A beautifully stained window, the Nel'Varians truly are master craftspeople.
Dear XX,
Since you've been kind to me lately, I hoped I could trust you with a request. I'm looking for a new record, but the record store owner has been talking to me... a lot. I'd rather not see him today. Will you pick up a record and bring it to my home? I'm looking for something like a <b>waltz</b>. I've enclosed 500 gold to cover the cost. I'll pay you 500 gold for the delivery. Thanks in advance.

A hands-on chance to meet all of the friendly water pets Nel'Vari has to offer.
A machine for sewing, it looks like it's operated with a foot pedal.
Axes and yarn, the duality of Tornn.
Tornn must have excellent dexterity to work with sewing tools as tiny as these.
Lookin' good!

"<color=#39CCFF>Small mana tomes</color> - the fastest way to boost your magical ability! Bring your spell-game to the next level with <color=#39CCFF>small mana tomes</color>!"
Tucked inside this magazine is a note that reads, "Reminder: buy <color=#39CCFF>peppers</color>!"
The magazine is open to an article detailing the best way to cultivate <color=#39CCFF>greenroot</color>.
It looks like a recipe for an <color=#39CCFF>energy smoothie</color>.
There's a picture of <color=#39CCFF>spicy ramen</color> with a note next to it: "YUM!"
It's an old scroll that looks half-burned. It shows different techniques for casting fire spells. A word written in the corner reads, "CINDERHEAD."
It's a worn-out apron. A picture in the pocket shows a man wearing it, standing with a young boy who resembles Liam.
It's a picture of a chef wearing a <color=#39CCFF>chef's hat</color>. The hat is circled with a handwritten message that reads, "SO COOL!!"
The page is open to a step-by-step guide to brewing the perfect cup of <color=#39CCFF>coffee</color>.
Liam wrote a note on the side of the page. It looks like a short list, including <color=#39CCFF>cookies</color> and <color=#39CCFF>flour</color>.
"The perfect way to keep your gold safe - <color=#39CCFF>small money bag</color>!!"
It looks like an opinion article. It reads, "Trying to impress your someone special? Gemstones show you're invested in your heart AND your wallet!
<color=#39CCFF>Ruby</color> and <color=#39CCFF>sapphire</color> are popular stones, but <color=#39CCFF>amethyst</color> is a great choice that is often overlooked."
A handwritten note is laying on top of the magazine. It reads "<color=#39CCFF>Raspberry Cheesecake</color> Ingredients: <color=#39CCFF>Raspberry</color>, Cheesecake???"
An article seems to have been ripped out, but the title is still on the page - Finding <color=#39CCFF>Gold Ore</color> for Amateurs.
This is a painted portait of the Southern Islands. Somebody wrote something on the frame, "One day."
This looks like Jun's diary. It's almost completely full with his most private thoughts... Better leave it.
"Healthy Living's #1 suggested snack is... <color=#39CCFF>spring rolls</color>!"
"Need help with your <color=#39CCFF>sesame rice balls</color>? Follow this quick and easy recipe!"
"<color=#39CCFF>Chicken noodle soup</color> made easy."
There are red stains on the page. It looks like Jun was eating <color=#39CCFF>spaghetti</color>.
It's an article titled, "5 Decorative Uses for your <color=#39CCFF>Sand Dollars</color>."
Nathaniel's Quarters
"Soldier's Diet Weekly - this week's HOT recommendations are <color=#39CCFF>earth's pie</color> and <color=#39CCFF>mashed potatoes with gravy</color>."
The magazine is open to a page full of armor sets.
There are circles drawn around <color=#39CCFF>copper armor</color>, <color=#39CCFF>iron armor</color>, <color=#39CCFF>adamant armor</color>, <color=#39CCFF>mithril armor</color>, and <color=#39CCFF>sunite armor</color>.
It's an outdated record player. There are carvings in the base that look like they were done by a child.
It appears to be a flyer from the record store in Sun Haven. It says, "<color=#39CCFF>Records</color> galore!"
"Get all the vitamins you need with <color=#39CCFF>red veggie soup</color>!"
There's an article describing the pros and cons of <color=#39CCFF>tomato soup</color>. It's surprisingly in-depth.
The magazine is open to a page of different <color=#39CCFF>record players</color>.
Scrawled on the side of the page is what looks like an unfinished shopping list. The only item on the list is, <color=#39CCFF>tomatoes</color>.
"<color=#39CCFF>Spaghetti</color> made EASY!"
The first article on the page is titled "Fish this Season" and continues with a bulleted list:
<color=#39CCFF>Gold Fish</color>, <color=#39CCFF>Red Snapper</color>, <color=#39CCFF>Blue Gill</color>, <color=#39CCFF>Carp</color>, <color=#39CCFF>Silver Carp</color>.
It looks like an article about how to prepare different fish.
There are circles drawn around <color=#39CCFF>Blue Tang</color>, <color=#39CCFF>Rainbow Trout</color>, <color=#39CCFF>Angel Fish</color>, and <color=#39CCFF>Pufferfish</color>.
A handwritten note next to the list says <i>FRESH!</i>
The page shows a picture of <color=#39CCFF>fish tempura</color>. Kitty seems to have written "YUMMY!!" next to it.
There's a picture of <color=#39CCFF>pet food</color> that is circled... many times.
It appears to be a dress that isn't finished yet. The needlework is impeccable! Who knew Kitty was so skilled?
The article is titled, "A Taste of the Southern Islands" and shows a picture of <color=#39CCFF>carribean green soup</color>.
The page has purple stains on it. Could Wornhardt have been eating a <color=#39CCFF>blueberry salad</color>?
Dreamcatchers are popular in the Southern Islands, but Dr. Wornhardt doesn't seem like the superstitious type.
It's a book of poetry with notes in the margins. They looks like incantations based on the poems. Is this how Catherine learned her spells?
Is this Catherine's shopping list? The list includes: <color=#39CCFF>Shimmeroot</color>, <color=#39CCFF>Carrots</color>, <color=#39CCFF>Blueberry Salad</color>.
"Step up your gardening game, with watering cans! Top 5 watering cans from best to worst: <color=#39CCFF>Sunite Watering Can</color>, <color=#39CCFF>Mithril Watering Can</color>,

Howdy Farmer,
You're working hard, I can see it in your wallet - I'm kidding! But I can tell that you've been getting more confidence to you, which is commendable. Now I don't do handouts but I can appreciate another small business owner. Consider this a loan. Pay me back by shopping at my store sometime.
Hey XX,
Well, color me impressed! Not only am I invested in your farm's growth, but also in how well you invest your money back into the business. You're a skilled farmer and business owner! It's been a while since I've seen someone with your dedication and generosity, and I guess it struck a chord with me. Now is my time to be generous to you, just this once. It's my favorite, so don't waste it - Raspberry Cheesecake on a Diamond Platter.
To Farmer XX,
I'm Bernard, administrator at Sun Haven's Town Hall. I wanted to reach out with this housewarming gift as a representative of Sun Haven. I hope it helps you get settled on your new land.
Come visit me at Town Hall to the south of Sun Haven's town square if you would like to build a barn for livestock. I can also authorize renovations to your old cabin with a <color=#39CCFF>house upgrade kit</color>.
Regards,
Hello XX,
When I have Greenroot, I always find there is a hop in my step. Since you have been working so hard on your farm, I thought you could use that extra hop as well.
You simply must try it!
I was restocking at my shop and it seems I had a handful of extra Cinaberry Seeds. When I saw them, I knew they matched your red aura and were meant for you. Please enjoy them and continue to glow!
I want to welcome you to Sun Haven. Unlike even my most trusty bass, I have yet to find you out of tune. I'm curious what kind of song you will conduct in Sun Haven. You appear truly unique, but we will only know once we get to the bridge of your piece.
I do hope your farm is prosperous here. Perhaps I could even get to know you further.
I have traveled for years and heard songs from across the world that simply did not inspire me, but never has something spurred my creativity as much as yourself. From melody to chorus, you are entirely one of a kind.
Continue to play your song, I cannot wait to hear it.
Outsider,
I am not going to pursue you as Xyla would, but I do think you have much to prove if you wish to be a true part of Withergate. So take these and show me you have some value to my family's kingdom. I do demand a cut of your crop, so bring me a Kraken Kale as thanks for my generosity.
I must admit, you are making waves in my court. Be careful not to undermine me or I will lock you in my dungeon for daring to act against the prince of Withergate without a second thought. I suppose, however, that you are finally earning some right to my presence and a place amongst my subjects, and dare I say, peers. You've earned my respect and for that, so I offer a single gift. Do not expect this to happen again.
Heyo XX,
Nice to get to stretch the old brain muscles and write a letter. Do you know how rare it is for me to do this? Mainly since Manhole #3 doesn't count as a valid return address. Lucky for me though, I could just borrow Darius's address. I'm sure they won't notice. Anyway! I was just coming up to get some grub and this guy just hands me a bone. Can you believe it! These suckers are like candy for an Amari like me. As much as I wanted to chew through it right away, I thought you might like it more. So give it a try!
Woof right, it's been a bit crazy since you came to Withergate. Your spice is exactly what this boring town needs, though. So thanks for that, making this place feel like home even though I am technically not supposed to be near the city right now due to... *ahem* circumstances.
Well XX, you did it! You got me liking human culture all over again. Jeez. Good thing you're cute or you would've gotten some real pushback.
I don't usually send mail outside of Nel'Vari, but I simply had to show you this remarkable basket of Blueberries I picked. I managed to get the tree to replenish in only a single hour!
P.S. You are allowed to eat it, please enjoy my work.
Our conversations inspired me to take a moment's rest and work on this furniture piece that I'd put off for far too long. I like how it turned out, so I wanted to show you what your encouragement helped me create.
P.S. I included some of my babies along with it, water them well!
Dearest XX,
I was walking Topi and Pod home from school yesterday when my mind began to wander. I was so lost in thought, I wandered myself right into an apple tree! It was funny in the moment though, plus I ended up with a surplus of apples. Please, enjoy these apples!
I find the best way to relax after a long and heart-filled session is to paint.
While working on this piece, I realized I was thinking of you. So, I want you to have this and remember to take a moment to appreciate the small things in life. Like a painting.

Hiya XX!
I saw the cuuutest plushie on my way from the pet store today. It looks JUST like you and I NEEDED to show you! Isn't it so cute, nya!?
You're always a very very nice person to me. You actually listen to me and hang out with me which is suuuper fun! So I wanted to get you something to say I was thinking of mew! Get it?? Teehee!
Hello there XX,
I was making some cookies to celebrate Elizabeth's school project (she got a SUPER! sticker), and I might have gone a little overboard. We had way too many and the shop was closed so I guess I thought hey, XX may like them.
So here’s a few treats, for you! I hope you like them!
P.S. You don't have to eat them if you don't like them.
Hi XX,
You have really helped me fully settle in here and you were supposed to be the new neighbor! So I thought, it was about time I bring you a housewarming gift. Except I couldn't find time to actually bring it to you, so I am sending it to you. I hope that is okay!
Thank you for being such a good friend and your support means a lot... and you know... Welcome to Sun Haven, I couldn't imagine the town without you!
I wanted to stop by to see how you were settling in, but I saw you were busy at work with a real fire in your eyes. Instead, I am writing you this letter to commend your hard work.
To thank you for your diligent work, I've included a small gift of Greenroot seeds. It may also be one of my favorites, I would not be opposed if you want to share!
You have continued to grow and change since coming to Sun Haven. To think you were also blessed by Elios makes us far closer to each other than anyone could imagine.
As a token of my admiration for someone as powerfully blessed as yourself, enjoy these mana tomes. I find they help me hone my mana just in time for training in the evening.
Hi there XX!
I know you're busy settling in still, but I noticed you were a little light on armor when you were headed to the forest. I was a bit worried about you, so I thought these would help get you started on some strong armor!
Stay Safe!
I saw your blade was looking a little dull, be sure to keep your sword sharp! I would be devastated to know a monster in the forest managed to hurt you because of a faulty weapon when I could have been there to help fix it!
Stay Sharp!
I heard about your skill from Roza as to how well you handle yourself in combat. You're very impressive with a sword, so I hear. So, you should come by the barracks sometime! I would enjoy the recruits seeing a true natural in action. Maybe I can offer a few pointers myself.
You missed joining in for a grand supper the last night, everyone in the barracks brought a dish! It was a true family-style potluck, one that I missed from when I was a rookie under my mother's command.
While you may not be a part of the guard, I do consider you a part of our family, XX. Join us next time! We would be glad to have you - if you bring a dish of your own of course!
Look here XX,
I was stocking up on odds and ends, and this shipment of records came in scratched. (That's what I get for buying in bulk!) Turns out this is my favorite song, so consider it a free sample for the wares I have at my store.
I was cooking dinner yesterday and I realized just how soothing this song was after stirring my cauldron all day. It is one of my favorites, so I hope it brings you a little peace as well.
In my days, I have spent much time alone working on music. Yet, I have only ever finished a single song that I liked. Though I dislike sharing it and have gone to great lengths to prevent those here from finding my records, you listened to my songs - unfinished or only barely started - with a smile. I feel like I can give this to you with the confidence you will enjoy it without judgment.
Human culture has always been lesser than that of the Demons. When we began the construction of Withergate City, musicians from across the land dared to present their music to my father and me. This is a recording of the best musicians to ever grace this world. Listen to it and perhaps you will begin to understand the true value of Withergate's culture.
I was sliding back down my ladder after helping this slime dude find his lost keys, and I had to pause - this great tune was playing on my record player! So in that moment I decided you need a copy. I mean, if I can jam out down in the sewers then you should be able to jam out wherever you want.
I spoke with Nivara today and she explained how much she much loved the tune of the birds. It was only then I realized how much I enjoy the music in my workshop and how it inspires me to work even harder. So I wish for you to have a copy of the song I like so much.
P.S. I hope it inspires your productivity on the farm.
I find meditating in the morning to be a good mindfulness practice. As I was enjoying my meditative trance, I found myself humming along to my music without thinking about it. You should give it a listen, I think you will enjoy the mellowing effect it has.
I so so LOVE this song and I needed you to hear it. So take a listen and fall in love with it, just like Kitty. It makes me wanna get up and shake my tail, nya!
Hi there XX,
During our session today, Jun reminded me that sometimes it's good to take a step back and relax. So I took today to listen to my favorite song. In a way, it was kind of stressful to take a whole day just to myself.
So you too. I mean you should too. Take a day... to listen to music you like.
I am going to sign this before I make it a complete disaster.
I was working late last night, finishing off a few of my Archmage duties which followed me home. I quite like to listen to music as I work, and I think you would as well. So please accept this gift, my favorite song to listen to. Perhaps it will be yours as well.
I wanted to thank you for spending so much time with me lately and making me feel welcome to Sun Haven. You may remember this song, I hum it when I tinker and I sing it when I walk, oh that is embarrassing to think about. I hope no one heard me on my walk...
Well, I really like the song and I want you to enjoy it as much as I do.
Enjoy!
Have you ever thought of battle like a dance? With every step and slash of your sword, you move in unison like making your own dance. The further you practice, the further you can perfect each movement.
So please, take this record. If you listen to it while you practice, it will be as though we are dancing together even when we are apart.
Taking to the air allows me to think and clear my head. It is a freeing experience I doubt you've had the honor of feeling just yet.
There is one thing that clears my head just as well though - this song, a true waltz in symphonic form. When the day comes where we dance in unison, this shall be our song. So learn it well, I would quite enjoy our dance to be perfect.
While I was looking over my next month of meetings and appointments, I found myself swaying to the music. This really is my favorite piece, I wish I knew who wrote it. Anywho, I asked around at the record store and they had a second-hand copy, too bad it was missing its sleeve as well. A shame, but now you can have one. Enjoy this song and sway along, like the trees in the wind, and lose yourself for a moment in the music!
Hey <s>Sewer Rat</s> XX,
I've yet to meet someone from the Human town that actually has some value to me, and that's still true. I will not allow you to bring your human nonsense into my town and mess up the place. So take whatever you were playing in your apartment and throw it out immediately. This is real music and I expect you to listen to it. Understood?!
To XX,
Since I fly over your farm on my way into Sun Haven, I've seen you do such interesting things. In Nel' Vari I see Iris, the Elven Enchantress, work with her plants.. but it's different from you. You tend your crops so gently, and with such care, instead. Truly, I'm delighted to see you care for nature, so with this letter I've included a gift that should help your work. Farewell.
Greetings my dear XX,
The more I explore, the more I find people who admire my abilities and admire me. Yet, you continue to only watch me with a smile. Knowing you has made me grateful for the time I spend more grounded. And while I cannot take you with me on my Nimbus Cloud, I wish you to have the same sense of being in the clouds as me. I used my own magic to make a bed this soft for you, so please enjoy it, my dear. I worked so hard that I nearly broke a sweat!
While an apple a day certainly does not keep the doctor away, a treat never hurt anyone now and again either. Make sure you are taking care of yourself and don't be afraid to stop by the hospital or my house for a check-up. I like to make sure everyone in Sun Haven is taken care of, especially if you are working hard in the sun. So come by any time!
You have been working so hard lately, I think you could really use a little time to lean back and watch the clouds. Just like our first date together. A lovely thing it was. So enjoy the clouds, the little things in life that we all wish we had more time for.
Hello Sewer Rat,
You've been such a pest, all of Withergate is talking about you sneaking into <i>my</i> city. Listen to me closely, I will PAY you to just stay out. So take the bribe, and stick to your cushy farm in Sun Haven. You got it?
Seems you're finally understanding the importance of all my work. The buildings, the layout, the shops, the carnival. All my work! When you were on your terrace the other night, I couldn't help but think about that. Wow, you weren't admiring me for once. Instead, you were admiring my craftsmanship, my work. In a way, that felt better than actually getting complimented. So take this, then you can admire my work at all times and compliment me about it later.
Finally! Thanks XX. Now I'll be able to sneak past those pesky Arcbugs, no problem. Here, take this for your help.
Deliver Lucius's <color=#39CCFF>illusory tonic</color> to Luke.

Angel's Polish
Oh happy day! Thanks to you XX, I will avoid another bad hair day. I just wonder how long I can hold onto this <color=#39CCFF>honey</color> before Luke wants it back...
XX, don't forget your payment!
Beeanca is determined to avoid a bad hair day. Deliver Luke's <color=#39CCFF>honey</color> to Beeanca as soon as possible!

Beeanca's Honey
Oh, look at that! They're just so lovely, don't you think? Thank you, XX, these will make darling adornments. Please take some of my mana orbs in return!

Caspian's Trinkets
About time! Can't you see I'm itching up a storm here?
... There we go... and there...
Ah... that's <i>much</i> better. No more itchy leaves.

Please deliver the <color=#39CCFF>citrus rub</color> to me quickly!
Clay's Pest Control
Are these Hornsnake <color=#39CCFF>antlers</color>? HAH! So you did it? Maybe that will keep them from taking over the forest like they own the place.
Take these, XX. And thanks for the help!
Gren is upset that the Hornsnakes are eating all the grubs in the forest. Defeat Hornsnakes and bring 5 <color=#39CCFF>antlers</color> back to Gren for proof.
These darn Hornsnakes are eating all the good grubs in the forest! Somebody needs to teach them to share the forest. I'll provide mana orbs to anyone who can teach those Hornsnakes a lesson. Bring me 5 <color=#39CCFF>antlers</color> as proof. That'll show them.
Gren's Proof
Hm? Oh, XX. You brought me the bark fish I needed? Excellent, here's your pay.
Was there something else? No? Good.
Wesley needs 3 <color=#39CCFF>bark fish</color> to feed the griffon on your farm. Bring Wesley 3 <color=#39CCFF>bark fish</color> so the griffon can eat.
Do you have any idea how much a griffon eats? Well they eat a <i>lot</i>. Somebody please help me prepare today's meal for the griffon. I'd say 3 <color=#39CCFF>bark fish</color> would be enough. Just bring me the fish and I'll handle the rest.
Griffin's Gotta Eat
Oh, thank you. I hope it wasn't too much trouble to get these, but it's a huge help to my work. Here, these orbs are yours.
Iris needs some <color=#39CCFF>water crystals</color> and <color=#39CCFF>earth crystals</color> so she can get to work on her next enchanting project. Bring Iris 3 <color=#39CCFF>water crystals</color> and 3 <color=#39CCFF>earth crystals</color>.

So this is the elixir? It doesn't look so special... but I guess I'll find out.
Here you go, for your help.
Opal has an elixir called <color=#39CCFF>moonsight potion</color> that is supposed to increase one's sight in darkness. Retrieve Opal's <color=#39CCFF>moonsight potion</color> and deliver it to Jarrod.
Opal has been working on an elixir that she claims will improve my sight in the dark. It's called <color=#39CCFF>moonsight potion</color>. I'm skeptical, but I think it's worth a shot. I'll repay anyone who can deliver the potion to me.
Jarrod's Sight
Oh, a <color=#39CCFF>glass jar</color>. I don't know why you think I need these, they're not for a shrine to the moon. Again, I am unsure why you have brought these jars to me, however I am willing to pay you for them so I might, er, not use them. Thanks.
Lucius totally doesn't need a <color=#39CCFF>glass jar</color> from Sylvius. If he did, though, you could pick up the order of a <color=#39CCFF>glass jar</color> from Sylvius and bring it Lucius.
It's not that I'm constructing a shrine to the moon or anything like that, but if I were then I would need a <color=#39CCFF>glass jar</color> from Sylvius. You know, to keep the fireflies in? Well, it's not like I have an order for a <color=#39CCFF>glass jar</color> from Sylvius or anything, but if I did, someone could pick them up for me. Not that I do, of course.
Lucius's Jars
Are these the leaves? They don't smell that great to me... I guess it's nothing. What a surprise, thanks Wesley.
Here XX, for your help.
Morgan needs 5 <color=#39CCFF>Walk Choy Leaves</color> so Wesley will stop telling her how good they smell. Bring Morgan 5 <color=#39CCFF>Walk Choy Leaves</color>.
Wesley won't stop talking about <color=#39CCFF>Walk Choy Leaves</color>. He's been using them in his home for their scent and insists I do the same. I need to try it or he will <i>never</i> stop talking to me about it. Will somebody please bring 5 <color=#39CCFF>Walk Choy Leaves</color> my way so I can put this to rest? Thanks.
Morgan's Leaves
Ah, a beautiful <color=#39CCFF>dragon gulper</color>. And what a specimen it is!
Thank you, XX. I hope it wasn't too much trouble. Here, please, take this token of my appreciation.
Opal realized she's never tried <color=#39CCFF>dragon gulper</color> before. Catch 1 <color=#39CCFF>dragon gulper</color> in the waters of Nel'Vari and bring the fish to Opal.
As I lost myself in the moonlight last night, I Realized I've never tried <color=#39CCFF>dragon gulper</color> before. It would be wonderful if somebody could bring me a <color=#39CCFF>dragon gulper</color> to try tonight. And of course, I'll reward your efforts - Nel'Vari waters can be tricky fishing!
Opal's Fish
Oh, thank you for getting these for me! It must not have been easy, but they all look very high quality! Sylvius will appreciate it. He could use the extra practice if he wants to get as good as me, hehe.
Sylvia wants to surprise her brother with <color=#39CCFF>adamant ore</color> for his woodworking. Bring her 4 <color=#39CCFF>adamant ore</color> for Sylvius's gift.
My brother Sylvius has been looking for ways to spruce up his woodwork. He's been talking about using <color=#39CCFF>adamant ore</color> in his designs. Could someone bring me 4 <color=#39CCFF>adamant ore</color> so I could surprise him? It would mean a lot!
Ore For Sylvia

Oh, but I'll still pay you! Here, have some mana orbs.
Quincy wants to use Sylvia's <color=#39CCFF>animal food</color> to take care of the forest animals. Gather some <color=#39CCFF>animal food</color> from Sylvia and bring it to Quincy.

Quincy's Food Service
Thank goodness, maybe now I can get some relief. I hope this stuff works - and doesn't turn me into a banana tree or something!
Oh right, here you go XX. You've earned these mana orbs.
Reed has an irritating skin condition, but Iris has the cure. Deliver the <color=#39CCFF>nutrient salve</color> from Iris to Reed.

Reed's Needs
Farmer! You are reliable after all, huh? Many thanks, please take this for your trouble.
Rel'Tar needs <color=#39CCFF>peanuts</color> to polish his crossbows! Bring Rel'Tar 3 <color=#39CCFF>peanuts</color>.
I've been experimenting lately, crafting my crossbows with different materials. It turns out that the oil from <color=#39CCFF>peanuts</color> provides a nice polish to freshly-hewn wood. I'd go out and get them myself, but my bad knee is acting up. If someone can bring me 3 <color=#39CCFF>peanuts</color>, then I'll pay accordingly.
Rel'Tar's Peanuts
Are these the <color=#39CCFF>blueberries</color> and <color=#39CCFF>small mana tome</color>? Thank you very much for getting these for me. Here are the orbs I promised.
Tornn needs <color=#39CCFF>blueberries</color> and a <color=#39CCFF>small mana tome</color> for his dye. Gather 6 <color=#39CCFF>blueberries</color> and a <color=#39CCFF>small mana tome</color> so Tornn can make his dye.
I'm running very low on dye. I can prepare my own if someone collects the ingredients for me. For color I need <color=#39CCFF>blueberries</color>, though I also infuse my dyes with mana. A <color=#39CCFF>small mana tome</color> will be enough. If anyone could bring me 6 <color=#39CCFF>blueberries</color> as well as a <color=#39CCFF>small mana tome</color>, I would appreciate, as well as compensate, their effort.
Tornn's Dye
Ah, can you smell that? Now <i>that's</i> good pollen. My flowerbeds will be spreading like wildfire after this!
Thanks, XX. I'm touched that you would take time out of your day to help me. Here, please take some mana orbs in return.

Vaan's Horticulture
Thank goodness gracious, you've brought a <color=#39CCFF>bird's nest</color>!
Yes, this will do nicely. XX, you just saved the Elder from a terrible spiritual imbalance. As thanks, please take these mana orbs.
Wesley is asking for a <color=#39CCFF>bird's nest</color> for the Elder to use in a spiritual centering ceremony. Check with Salix, just south of town, for a <color=#39CCFF>bird's nest</color> and return it to Wesley in the Grand Tree.
The Elder must complete a spiritual centering ceremony by the end of the day, but he's missing one ingredient - a <color=#39CCFF>bird's nest</color>. If anybody finds a <color=#39CCFF>bird's nest</color>, please deliver it to me without hesitation! If I had to guess where to find one, I would advise you check with Salix to the south of town - he's bound to have a nest somewhere.
Wesley's Emergency
Oh yay! You brought the crystals I asked for? Now Dew and Sable will see that mine is the sparkliest!
Here, you can have some sparklies too!
Willow is asking for 2 <color=#39CCFF>fire crystals</color>, 2 <color=#39CCFF>water crystals</color>, and 2 <color=#39CCFF>earth crystals</color> so she and her sisters can decide which is the prettiest. Grow the crystals on your farm and deliver them to Willow.
Dew and Sable and I can't agree! What's prettiest between the fire crystals, earth crystals, and water crystals?? I say water crystals are prettiest, but Dew like fire crystals and you won't <i>believe</i> what Sable thinks. Somebody, please bring us 2 of each crystal so we can decide! And if you can, please grow them fresh!! Thank you!!!
Willow's Crystals

I miss the old days of knighthood. Can someone help me relive my glory days? I only want to wear a <color=#39CCFF>mithril helmet</color> again. It would be quite meaningful to me, and I'll pay more than it's worth!

I passed the first lesson, but now I should speak to Nivara at her Sanctuary in Nel'Vari to begin the second one.
Nivara's Lesson: Commonality
Nivara has asked me to speak to Wesley and find common ground with him, which seems easier said than done. I should speak to Wesley, who I can find in the tavern of the Grand Tree.
Wesley wasn't interested in even trying to talk to me. Maybe Gorwin can help me out, I should speak to him in his Council Room at the Grand Tree.
Wesley apparently worked very hard to get my Nel'Vari farm ready for me. I should do something nice for everyone to show my appreciation, a donation of Mana Orbs might be the right thing to do. I should donate 100 Mana Orbs to the donation box in the center of Nel'Vari, next to the bulletin board.
Wesley says he's working on restoring the original version of an old Nel'Varian poem. I should speak to Amanda at the Library in Sun Haven and ask to see that old Nel'Vari text again.
Amanda won't let me take the Nel'Vari text, but she says she'll let me make a copy of it. I just need to make some charcoal so I have something to write with. I should use a log on a furnace to craft charcoal, then return to Amanda at the Library.
I've made a copy of the Nel'Varian text. Now I should return it to Wesley at Nel'Vari.
I've actually gotten Wesley to admit we have something in common. I should return to Nivara now in her Sanctuary.
I have passed the first two lessons that Nivara has given me. When I am ready for the final one, I should speak to Nivara in her Sanctuary.
Nivara's Lesson: Growth
Nivara has given me a special seed to plant and grow, so I may pass my final lesson. I should plant the Nel'Varian seed in the plot of dirt at Nivara's Sanctuary.
Nivara has told me that my seed has sprouted, but it needs one final mana infusion before it "blossoms". I should head to her Sanctuary to take care of that.
I should speak to Nivara at her Sanctuary to begin her first lesson.
Nivara's Lesson: Perspective
Hello, XX. Nivara told me you'd seek me out. You'll learn a lot from her, trust me.
...As part of her lesson, I want to ask you to do something. Let me explain...
Nel'Vari is able to flourish the best when we are kept hidden. It's safer for us this way, only opening to those who prove themselves a friend, such as you.
A powerful protection spell keeps Nel'Vari hidden, fueled by the mana conduits found around the city. Infusing mana into the conduits keeps the spell charged.
Will you visit each conduit and make an infusion to them, to keep Nel'Vari hidden?
Nivara has asked me to seek out the perspectives of two of her star pupils. The first is Iris, the Enchantress. I should find Iris and talk to her.
Thank you, XX... A long time ago our way of life, and even our very existence, was gravely threatened. I don't want to talk about it, but I never want something like that to happen ever again.
So it's best if Nel'Vari just stays hidden. I don't know if you'll agree with me on that or not, but thank you for helping anyways.
Nivara is an excellent teacher, so take whatever she tells you to heart.
Iris asked me to infuse the mana conduits throughout Nel'Vari with mana. I should make at least one infusion to each and then speak to Iris again. The first conduit can be found on the path leading out of town, towards my farm. The second conduit can be found near the farm animal pens. The third conduit is in the city plaza, near where Caspain prefers to lounge. The final conduit can be found near the Grand Tree.
Hello there, XX. You're here because Nivara asked you to come, aren't you? Gorwin told me everything about your lesson on 'perspective', along with my place in it.
There's a lot you can learn from Nivara's lessons here in Nel'Vari, but I also know there's a lot more you can learn <i>outside</i> of Nel'Vari.
Nivara can teach you a lot. But at the same time, don't feel held back, do you know what I mean?
I'll tell you what, this is my test... I've hidden something just outside of Nel'Vari. If you find it, you'll pass my test. It'll be easy for you, I'm sure.
I've learned Iris's perspective, now I should find Vaan, the Air Mage and learn what he has to say.
Found it already, did you? Heh. I thought I had hidden it well.
Alright, XX, it seems you've passed my test, well done.
I'll leave you with this-- Nivara told me that Gorwin has prepared a 'special task' for you. Best of luck with your lessons, and with wising up!
I should find what Vaan 'hid' to the south of Nel'Vari and return to him.
Ah, hello XX. How is your training with Nivara?
... ... ...
Oh?! I'm sorry, XX. I was not expecting to be part of your lesson!
...Vaan is quite fond of his pranks, as usual, hoho.
But you are here, so let me tell you this, XX. There are many who live in Nel'Vari, and each of them feels a certain way. They are equally valid to me.
Some value hiding from the world, and I respect their reasons why. Others wish to see the world and brave the potential threats outside. I do not discourage them either.
I am the Elder, and all perspectives must not only be known to me, but acknowleged.
It is something my young Apprentice Wesley is having trouble grasping, but I still remember when I was young, myself. I believe in his ability to understand the value of perspectives, and I believe in yours as well.
As for your 'special task'? Hm, well, how about this... return to Nivara and tell her that I send my greetings, hohoho.
Nivara has asked me to speak to Gorwin and receive his task. I should find him in his Council Room at the Grand Tree.
Gorwin has tasked me with giving his greetings to Nivara. I should return to Nivara and complete my 'task'.
Edwin has agreed to give me some more context on the cryptic Nel'Varian poem. I just have to pay off his bar tab, so I should speak to Mari at the tavern about doing that.
Path to Nel'Vari
Heheh <i>*hic*</i>. Mari is a good person, but Humans sure can be pretty gullible.
Of course I promised to grow her some Elven grapes... I just forgot to mention that I don't know how to grow them. It was an honest mistake, <i>*hic*</i> really!
You're the farming-type, aren't ya? Well let's see if you can sort it out then! Heh. Back in my home village, us Elves had a saying...
In common speak it translates to "You scratch my back, I'll scratch yours". What do ya think? <i>*hic*</i>. Just take these <color=#39CCFF>grape seeds</color> and grow em' at your farm.
Don't worry, farmer. They're magical Elven grapes, they'll only take <i>a single night to grow</i>, heh.
Mari has told me Edwin's tab was not money, but Elven grapes. I should speak to Edwin to learn more about these grapes.
Edwin gave me a packet of Elven grape seeds. I should plant and water all the seeds, and let them grow over night. You can buy extra at the farming store!
Something went wrong with the grapes, and the vines died overnight. Edwin at the tavern should be able to tell me more about what went wrong.
Good day, XX. How goes your effort in finding a way to Nel'Vari? I haven't thought to ask!
Oh? You need my help? With infusing mana? That is a somewhat unexpected request, although you are searching for a hidden Elven city, so maybe it isn't so unexpected after all.
It does happen to be something I know about, and of course I will help you understand how it works.
If you'd meet me in my office at town hall, I would be happy to teach you the art of mana infusion.
I've some small business to take care of at the moment, so please just wait in the town hall lobby and I'll receive you when I am ready.
I have to learn how to infuse mana so I can grow the Elven grapes. Lucia may know more about this, so I should talk to her.
Lucia has agreed to teach me what she knows of mana infusion. She wants me to wait in the lobby until she has completed some business.
Hello again, farmer. Eh? What's that look in your eyes for <i>*hic*</i>? Did the Archminister teach you all about mana infusing? Heheh, good <i>*hic*</i>.
I suppose you're ready to try growing those grapes again, eh? Lucky for you I have more seeds right here. Best of luck this time, farmer.
Now that I have a grasp on how to infuse mana, I should talk to Edwin at the tavern and see if he has more grape seeds.
This time when I plant the grape seeds, I'll be sure to infuse them with mana so they grow properly. I should go to my farm and plant, water and mana infuse each seed. You can buy extra at the farming store!
Now that I've grown the grapes, I should harvest 40 of them and head back to the tavern and talk to Edwin about clearing his tab.
You actually need my help finding a book? Funny, I never pegged you as the reading type, but oh well. What book are you looking for?
...Wait, really? This isn't a joke, is it? You want a book on... Nel'Vari?
Well, since you asked, I suppose I have to inform you that we do have a single book on the subject, though it is one of Sun Haven's guarded texts.
That is to say, if you wanted me to even fetch it from its vault, you would need express permission from town leadership first.
In summary, if you get permission from Lucia, then you can see the book... is how it works in theory, at least.
I need to find my way to the ancient Elven settlement of Nel'Vari. Amanda at the Sun Haven Library may be able to help me with this task.
Hello, XX! It's good we ran into each other, I've wanted to ask you how your mana infusing went. Did you find success?
Really? I'm quite glad to hear that. Is your next step to search for Nel'Vari, then?
Great. I'm glad I caught you before you left.
And XX, if it isn't too much trouble for you, would you please meet me at the barracks before you leave for Nel'Vari?
Nathaniel and I would like to see you off before your travels.
I think I'm ready to go out and search for Nel'Vari. Before I go, I should tell Lucia how things went with the mana infusing.
Lucia has requested that I meet with her before I leave to find Nel'Vari. I should go to the barracks in Sun Haven and find Lucia there.
It's time for me to find Nel'Vari. I know that it's to the west, so I should explore the western forests.
I've discovered a beautiful Elven forest. I should continue my way West through it and find the way to Nel'Vari.
Salix mentioned that his friend appears to be dormant and out of mana. I wonder if a mana infusion would awaken them.
Good day, XX.
...Oh? The Sun Dragon has tasked you with discovering a path to Nel'vari? That is... extraordinary, to say the least!
I know if anyone is up to such a task, though, it must be you! In other words, I am happy to offer everything in my power, as Archmage and as a friend, to help you.
As for the book you're looking for, it is an ancient artifact of Sun Haven's that is generally off limits.
However, since Elios has given you this task, I will grant you access. On just one condition, though. The text is so old and its pages are so fragile that it isn't safe to handle with your bare hands.
To avoid damaging it, I request you use a special pair of delicate silk gloves to protect the pages.
This precaution might sound silly, but it's only in order to protect one of Sun Haven's oldest and most invaluable texts.
Don't worry, you should have no problem crafting a pair at a loom! Once you have an appropriate pair of gloves, you are free to view the Nel'Vari text as you please.
Amanda has told me to get permission from Lucia in order to view a book concerning the Elven city of Nel'Vari. I should find Lucia on my map and talk to her.
You're back for that Nel'Vari text? Alright, well, Lucia has informed me of your express permission to view the text, and unfortunately I can't really argue with her.
Alright, I'll go get the book and you can take a look at it.
Lucia has given me permission to read the ancient Nel'Vari text at the library, on the condition that I create a special pair of gloves to safely handle the old and fragile pages. I can create these gloves with the help of a loom.
The Nel'Vari text is written in a language I don't understand. Amanda has suggested seeking out Edwin at the Sun Haven Tavern, as he may know what the words say.
So that guy was a bust, huh? Oh well, I guess you tried.
...What? Don't look at me like that! I helped the best I could!
...Alright, fine. If you <i>really</i> want to find out what this text says, then there is only one other thing I can think of that would help you.
Don't expect this to work, or even be possible, of course. But it is said that there exists a legendary artifact known as <color=#39CCFF>The Stone of Tongues</color>.
It's an enchanted stone that is capable of allowing those who possess it to understand any language. Sounds ridiculous to me, but it's probably the best shot you have.
If anyone knows anything more about the stone, it would have to be <i>someone who has traveled around the world and knows a good deal about rare or <b>expensive</b> relics</i>.
Perhaps one of the merchants knows. Just don't get your hopes up. Even if the stone exists, what are the odds someone in Sun Haven knows anything about it?
Edwin at the tavern does not speak Nel'Varian and can't translate the Nel'Vari text. I should return to Amanda at the library and see if she has any other ideas.
What's that? A 'Stone of Tongues'? ...Well yeah, of course I know what it is.
I actually purchased it not that long ago at an auction... a perfectly reputable auction, of course.
It was quite the investment, so I'm determined to get my money's worth for it once I find a buyer!
What, really? You need it? For a quest? That Elios the Sun Dragon himself gave to you?
...Alright, listen. I've seen you around now a few times and I feel I can actually trust you, XX.
In fact, if you're willing to do something for me, I'll even <i>loan</i> you it for the time being. Sound fair?
So here's the deal, I actually have no idea where the stone is right now. Don't worry, it's hidden and safe, I just don't know exactly <i>where</i>.
Here's a merchant secret - keep your good stuff hidden.
I have Duke run off into the forest and hide all of my most valuable pieces. He's great at digging, though his memory is awful, so retrieval is always... a process.
Go out and find all my treasures and I'll loan you the stone. Fair? Great!
Just search around for any <color=#39CCFF>disturbed dirt piles</color> in the forest around town and bring my goods back to me.
Amanda has heard tales of a legendary stone that is capable of translating any language. Anne might know something about such a priceless artifact, so I should ask her for help. I can find Anne on my map.
Wow, that was pretty fast, all things considered. Alright XX, A deal's a deal. You can borrow my stone for now.
Just let me know me how it works, by the way. I was promised it could translate <i>any</i> language, after all-- Not that it would necessarily do anything for me.
Across all my travels I picked up a lot of different languages. As it turns out, money talks... but so does good bargaining.
Anne has generously offered to let me borrow the Stone of Tongues, all I have to do is search around the forest to dig her hidden treasures up. I should search around the forests west of Sun Haven and see if I can find any inconspicuous piles of dirt.
With the Stone of Tongues in hand, it's time to see if the Nel'Varian text can be translated. I should visit Amanda again and take another look at the book.
Hm? Back again, farmer? <i>*hic*</i>. What's this? You figured out what your Nel'Vari text said, huh? So what did it say?
...Heh. Well, your 'mysterious Nel'Vari text' is nothing but a common Elven lullaby. My mum and pop used to sing it to me every night to lull me off to sleep, heh.
I could tell you what I think it means, but that'll cost ya... let's say this... I got a tab open with Mari, for my drinks. She's been on me lately about paying it off.
You pay off my tab for me, and I'll explain everything. Simple, right? <i>*hic*</i> Heh...
The Stone of Tongues translated the text, which turned out to be some sort of Elven poem. I have no idea what it means, but perhaps Edwin at the tavern can give me more of a clue.

Hey XX! The Elder and Nivara must be ready by now, don't you think? You should go visit the Grand Tree and see what's up! It's right up to the north of town.
Nivara needs some time to prepare for my audience with her. I should wait for two days and then meet Gorwin in the Grand Tree.
The World Dragon
Wesley has told me I'm not allowed to use the Wind Lift to the council room, I'll have to scale the outside of the tree to reach the top. I should go to the second floor of the Great Tree and find a way outside the tree.
The old path up the Grand Tree is right out the door of the second floor in the Grand Tree. I should try not to fall while I climb.
It's time to finally meet the World Dragon. I should head to her Sanctuary by taking the road north of the Grand Tree in Nel'Vari.
Wilt is acting funny? ...I was worried about that.
The treefolk have been having... problems lately. I'm not entirely certain why it's happening, but that's a problem for another day.
Right now, Wilt needs help, or else he'll fall dormant and need an infusion of mana. Time is of the essence, so you'll need to go quickly. In the forests right outside of Nel'Vari, you'll find Soul Sap trees.
They look a lot like normal trees, though their sap has powerful qualities that we can use to aid Wilt.
Chop the Soul Sap trees down and bring me six Soul Sap. Can you do that? I'd go with you, but... it's best if I stay in Nel'Vari, okay?
Remember, you can find Soul Sap trees all through the forests outside of town.
Wilt spoke the name "Iris" before he blanked out. I should find Iris and see if she knows anything.
Thanks for being so quick about this, XX. I think it should certainly help Wilt. Just give a moment to enchant this sap...
Alright, the enchantment I've added to this sap will be more than enough to kickstart Wilt and get him going again.
What? Oh just rub it all over him, it'll work. Trust me!
Iris requested I collect 6 Soul Sap from the Soul Sap trees found outside of Nel'Vari. I should collect the sap from the Elven Forest and then speak to Iris again.
Iris enchanted the Soul Sap I got for her. I can now 'apply' it to Wilt, which should cure his problem. I should go to Wilt and help him out.
It's time to finally meet the World Dragon. I should head to her sanctum by taking the road north of the Grand Tree in Nel'Vari.

Dialogue||I am eager to pass this land fully into the hands of Growin and his people.
Dialogue||Elios is an age-old ally. We have learned much from each other.
Dialogue||I am not one for material sentiment, but I quite enjoy the peace of my sanctuary.
Dialogue||Little sprout, what brings you to my sanctuary?
Dialogue||Tell me more about what you do here.
Dialogue||I want to know more about you.
Dialogue||Certainly. When I first found Nel'Vari, the Elves were already well established here. However, they were spiritually lost.
Dialogue||Being the World Dragon, it is my responsibility to maintain nature's balance wherever I go. Seeing the Elves in need, I had no choice but to help.
Dialogue||Over time I witnessed their impact on the forest here. Their efforts go further than they know, as nature is a cascade of cause and effect.
Dialogue||So I remain in my sanctuary here to guide the cascade and maintain harmony.
Dialogue||My story is not unlike your own, little sprout. I, too, traveled the world until I found the place where I am needed most.
Dialogue||Don't you think you could help elsewhere, too?
Dialogue||With your guidance, it's no wonder the forest is so bountiful.
Dialogue||Your intentions are pure, but your knowledge is limited. I have chosen this place because of the Elves' immense influence on this part of the world.
Dialogue||Trust that I am in tune with the world at large, and there are forces other than myself maintaining balance in nature.
Dialogue||This forest is certainly a special place. I have chosen it because of the Elves' immense influence on this part of the world. They deserve every bit as much credit as I do.
Dialogue||I doubt you came here by train, though!
Dialogue||Where did you come from?
Dialogue||Indeed, I have not yet seen a train in this world big enough to transport me. No, I came from very far away, the other side of the world.
Dialogue||I was guardian to a village of misguided Elementals. There, I was eventually able to distill my wisdom and pass my teachings to a trusted disciple before leaving to spread my teachings further.
Dialogue||After mere weeks of travel, I found Gorwin and his people here.
Dialogue||I came from very far away, the other side of the world.
Dialogue||Let the energy of the world flow through you as rivers flow through land.
Dialogue||My time in Nel'Vari is not yet done.
Dialogue||Come aboard, traveler. Let us embark. Where would you like to go?
Dialogue||Take me to Sun Haven Farm.
Dialogue||Take me to the Withergate apartments.
Dialogue||Oh, hello. Are you here to make an offering to gain the Moon Dragon's good graces?
Dialogue||I'm going to stop Dynus.
Dialogue||Can you explain the altars?
Dialogue||The Demons are a convenient vehicle for my dominion... Do not be confused, helping them is not my intent. They are a stepping stone... toward my empire.
Dialogue||Helllllooo, traveler. I am called the Spectacular Sombasu!
Dialogue||Hi, I'm XX.
Dialogue||Yesss, I know. I also know your future is in quessstion. Of course, I can cleeeaaar that up for you, for but a fee.
Dialogue||If you're scared of the ferris wheel, just remember that fear comes from within.
Dialogue||Isn't there anyone in this town who can really challenge me?
Dialogue||The entiiiirety of your life'ssss mysteries, for mere ticketssss!
Dialogue||Not right now kid. I'm takin' a break.
Dialogue||Yoooou are going to have a gooood day tomorrow! But what of the day aaaafter?
Dialogue||The future is the keeey!
Dialogue||If the rides are making you sick, just keep your breathing steady.
Dialogue||There is a shaaaadow on the horiiiizon... of your dessssstiny.
Dialogue||Who daaaaares approach the Spectaaaacular Sombasuuuu??
Dialogue||Didn't we meet already? It's hard to keep track of all the faces here.
Dialogue||Do you like living in Withergate?
Dialogue||The folk in this town are worth their salt, that's for certain. I'm a martial artist, so I know how to spot people with potential.
Dialogue||I love being surrounded by that energy, like anyone around might start a fight.
Dialogue||I do work around the carnival. It's nothing exciting, just keeping people in order for the most part.
Dialogue||I like it because it comes with a lot of down time. That's why I practice my martial arts.
Dialogue||So you're hoping for a fight?
Dialogue||You sound like a violent person.
Dialogue||That's not quite what I mean. I don't <i>want</i> to get into any trouble. That's not the way of the martial artist.
Dialogue||Still, knowing that there are some people here whose strength rivals my own - now <i>that</i> is thrilling.
Dialogue||I guess that's true, but I'm not trying to start any trouble or anything. I'm here in case trouble breaks out. Still, it's exciting to know that there are people here whose strength rivals my own.
Dialogue||You're keeping order here? That explains a lot...
Dialogue||To keep people in line takes a strong will.
Dialogue||Excuse me??
Dialogue||Wait... forget it. You're not worth my time.
Dialogue||Hm? You almost sound like a martial artist, speaking like that! I'm starting to like you, XX.
Dialogue||I'm not trying to be rude, but I don't like wasting my time with small talk.
Dialogue||Hm? Oh, it's you. Good to see you again.
Dialogue||Yesss?
Dialogue||I was wondering where you got that name.
Dialogue||How did you learn to see the future?
Dialogue||People began referrrring to me as the Spectaaaacular Sombaaaasu after I began traveling the world. I made a name for mysssself over years of traveling divinaaaation.
Dialogue||The thirrrrd eye, the eye of the fuuuuuture... it showed itsssself to me in my far-gone youth. With its power in my graaaasp, there was nothing I could not seeeee!
Dialogue||It's kind of a silly name.
Dialogue||The name suits you!
Dialogue||Your fffffortune will bear oooonly rotten fruit if you continue to treeeaaat people this way...
Dialogue||Why thaaaank you, dear chiiiild! Your fortune will be ssssstrong if you always treat people thisssss nicely.
Dialogue||Did that cause problems?
Dialogue||It must have been nice, growing up with that power!
Dialogue||Yessss... it was a blesssssing and a curssssse.
Dialogue||Huh? Who are you supposed to be?
Dialogue||My name is XX. Who are you?
Dialogue||Me? I'm Zeke.
Dialogue||Every night is a good night at the carnival!
Dialogue||Hi - Hello - Howdy. Are you here to collect a prize or what?
Dialogue||I just want to talk to you!
Dialogue||Do you like this job?
Dialogue||... Why? I'm just trying to work here.
Dialogue||Sheesh, tourists...
Dialogue||I get yelled at by children, I clean up sticky messes all day long, and I think a rat sleeps in this head at night... What's not to like?
Dialogue||You're right, I am a tourist!
Dialogue||Actually, I live here!
Dialogue||Yes, that's obvious. You're so... happy and enthusiastic... ugh. I would throw up, but then I'd have to clean it..
Dialogue||Is that so? Yeesh, they'll let anyone in nowadays... What is this town coming to?
Dialogue||You're being sarcastic.
Dialogue||Sounds like a dream!
Dialogue||Wow, how very observant. You must be some kind of mastermind.
Dialogue||Heh, yeah that's me. Living the dream.
Dialogue||This job is just temporary.
Dialogue||Glad you're having so much fun...
Dialogue||It's almost time for my break.
Dialogue||Hi - Hello - Howdy.
Dialogue||This suit is too hot...
Dialogue||You know, I wanted to join the circus.
Dialogue||Hi - Hello - Howdy, welcome to Prize Plaza. How can I help you?
Dialogue||Hello, my name is XX!
Dialogue||Great... As you can see on my nametag, my name is Luis.
Dialogue||How does my bowtie stay on? It's tied around my neck, obviously!
Dialogue||Are ya here to stand around, or to have some fun!?
Dialogue||I sure could use a cup of coffee - with extra sugar!
Dialogue||You do not look very strong, but looks can be misleading! Unless you operate through a sophisticated AI, of course.
Dialogue||I'm keeping my eye on you... Heh.
Dialogue||Welcome back - what'd ya say yer name was? - right, XX!
Dialogue||How come I haven't seen any other Cyclops?
Dialogue||Are you really an archer?
Dialogue||We're a dyin' breed! Problem is, we Cyclops are too infatuated by folks with two eyes. Then when we have babies - they come out with two eyes as well! T'is a shame, but a shame of our own makin'.
Dialogue||An archer? Sure, I could be! Never really tried a'fore, to be perfectly honest with ya.
Dialogue||Why don't you just marry other Cyclops?
Dialogue||Follow your heart and everything will work out.
Dialogue||I would, if not fer that pink-haired mermaid... She slips by every day, and every day she smiles as she goes... I'd give up my one and only eye fer her, and I mean that!
Dialogue||Thanks kid. That's what I keep tellin' me'self but the fact is, Cyclops numbers are still droppin'.
Dialogue||Aw heck, who knows? Maybe there's a commune with dozens of families out there that I just don't know about!
Dialogue||Then why do you run this game?
Dialogue||Doesn't that make you kind of a phoney?
Dialogue||S'only a job, kiddo. Sorry if that dissapoints ya, but I need t'make ends meet, now don't I?
Dialogue||Phoney?! Yer lucky I really ain't an archer, else I'd have you stuck like a pincushion!
Dialogue||Hi, I'm Billie! I just started working here. Thanks for coming in!
Dialogue||You too, XX. I'm sure you're busy, so I won't keep you. Just let me know if you need me, 'kay?
Dialogue||It looks like you're my only customer! Which makes you my best customer! So get buyin', best customer!
Dialogue||Is it your lucky day? Or mine? Let's find out!
Dialogue||I don't recognize you. Are you new?
Dialogue||I'm XX. Who are you?
Dialogue||Call me Zuri. Let me know if you wanna go 'round the wheel, eh?
Dialogue||I just love matching games! Is that so wrong?
Dialogue||I assume Salix would escort the person out of Nel'Vari. He's the big tree guy you saw guarding the entrance.
Dialogue||Step right up, one and all, to the fabulous collection of Scuzzy W. Bear!
Dialogue||How's tricks?
Dialogue||Why are you running this ferris wheel anyway?
Dialogue||I used to loooove ferris wheels as a living girl. I guess even in the afterlife some things never change, eh?
Dialogue||After I passed, I finally had time to visit all the theme parks I'd dreamed of visiting. It's a lot cheaper when you're dead!
Dialogue||I finally found Withergate's carnival, and it's the best one I've seen by far. I figure, why not stick around and enjoy it, eh?
Dialogue||Don't you think it's time to move on?
Dialogue||I love the ferris wheel, too.
Dialogue||Nah, but maybe it's time for <i>you</i> to move on.
Dialogue||Glad to see someone still appreciates the classic rides. The view from the top is too good to pass up!
Dialogue||You don't want to "pass on?"
Dialogue||So you're just going to work in the carnival forever?
Dialogue||Mm, there's plenty of time for that later. I mean, what's the rush? It's my afterlife, I figure I can spend it how I like.
Dialogue||Not forever, just for a while. Maybe a few hundred years or so. I mean, what's the rush? It's my afterlife, I figure I can spend it how I like.
Dialogue||Don't worry, the carts aren't real ghosts.
Dialogue||Think you've got a good eye?
Dialogue||What's a chap like you doing on a fine night like this? If you're looking for a challenge, you've come to the right Slime!
Dialogue||What's your name, chap?
Dialogue||I'm XX. What kind of game is this?
Dialogue||It's a pleasure, XX. Call me Chauncey! Mine is a game of perception and attention to detail. But, maybe that's not your kind of game...
Dialogue||Who is up for a challenge? How about, you? Or perhaps, you!
Dialogue||Hey, hey! Hands off the fur, kid! This stuff is the REAL deal! ...I think?
Dialogue||Sometimes even I lose track of the ball - honestly!
Dialogue||Everyone comes my way eventually.
Dialogue||Hey there! Looking for some fun?
Dialogue||Hold on, I don't recognize you. So you new to town or what?
Dialogue||My name's XX, I'm from Sun Haven.
Dialogue||What Haven? I don't know what you're talking about, but you can call me Benny. This booth is my whole life! Well, my <i>after</i>life.
Dialogue||My pappy named me Dugan. In my native tongue, it means "scholar." So much fer that!
Dialogue||If ya got no skill, then try your luck!
Dialogue||Welcome, dearest. My name is Morpha. I'm so glad you've come to visit today.
Dialogue||I'm XX. Were you expecting me?
Dialogue||Oh no, not at all...
Dialogue||But it is nice to have visitors!
Dialogue||Yeeesh, farmer. You got anywhere to sit around here? My stuffing is killing me!
Dialogue||The best part of being a ghost is how much money I save on sneakers.
Dialogue||What's with the look? I got no feets!
Dialogue||Anyone and everyone is welcome to go 'round and 'round, much as they please.
Dialogue||Wouldn't you rather spend your time winning tickets?
Dialogue||Another fan coming to see Withergate's finest busker? Sorry kid, I don't do autographs!
Dialogue||Do you have a lot of fans?
Dialogue||What's a busker?
Dialogue||Well, no. Not yet! I will soon though. I've got all the time in the world to build my fanbase!
Dialogue||Huh? You mean you aren't a busker-buff? Hmph, that's a slap in the ego...
Dialogue||A busker is a street performer, obviously!
Dialogue||That will never happen.
Dialogue||I bet you already have more fans than you know!
Dialogue||Not with that attitude... Besides, since I'm a ghost I can wait forever and ever to reach my success!
Dialogue||Is that right? Have you heard something?? This is it - Busker Benny is finally on his way to the big time!!
Dialogue||You seem proud to be a busker.
Dialogue||Is it a fun job?
Dialogue||It's not just a job, you know. It's my whole reason for being here! Sure, I could float off to the afterlife if I wanted to - <i>yawn!</i>
Dialogue||I still need to make a name for myself here before I move on. Soon, everyone will know Benny as the best busker in Withergate!
Dialogue||Ugh, sore feet. I guess that's what I get for being a nurse.
Dialogue||Hm... aren'tcha that outsider from Sun Haven? What'd they say yer name was?
Dialogue||I don't know what they said, but my name is XX.
Dialogue||Oh, yep that's not what they called you at all. Anyway, mine's Dugan!
Dialogue||I've no problem with you taking a shot at my game, s'long as you've got tickets. I don't take gold, got it?
Dialogue||Why do I use a dollie in my game? Mind your own business, that's why!
Dialogue||Greetings! Care for a spot of fun?
Dialogue||Beautiful night for a spin, eh?
Dialogue||Are you my next perceptive challenger? Or perhaps you're merely looking for a spot of conversation?
Dialogue||So you're a Slime?
Dialogue||That's a fine hat.
Dialogue||Why, am I dripping? Oh, you had me worried!
Dialogue||Haven't you met any slimes before?
Dialogue||Why thank you! I pulled it from the trash out back of Triberius's haberdashery. It is quite fetching, eh?
Dialogue||I've met one or two.
Dialogue||I haven't met a single one.
Dialogue||Then you already know - Slimes are the most cultured folk on the planet!
Dialogue||Well, I'm honored to represent us gelatinous gentlefolk. Slimes are the most cultured folk on the planet!
Dialogue||It suits you perfectly!
Dialogue||Ew! Trash hat!
Dialogue||You're a charming sort, aren't you! If only you were here ten minutes ago when those rude kids came by...
Dialogue||If you're bothered by trash, you wouldn't last a minute in a Slime commune.
Dialogue||Ugh, I think I stepped in a rain puddle a few miles back. My foot is gonna be wet all day now!
Dialogue||Oh! I'm sorry, I mistook you for an amphibian friend of mine. My name is Gren.
Dialogue||It's a wonderful time for Slimes in Withergate.
Dialogue||Withergate's Carnival is the best - and I've seen 'em all!
Dialogue||Isn't anyone in this town a proper marksman?
Dialogue||Does this darkness make me look pretty? Hee hee hee!
Dialogue||Will you be the first player to earn the title of Beefcake?
Dialogue||I'd say... you're perfect as you are, dearest!
Dialogue||You know what's crazy? You gave me a new lease on life, but I don't think we ever introduced ourselves! My name is Stephen. The... er, <i>retired</i>  poacher.
Dialogue||You can call me XX. I'm the farmer.
Dialogue||Do you ever think of working any other jobs?
Dialogue||You mean to tell me our Glorite operation got taken out by a farmer?
Dialogue||...Heheheh. That's life, isn't it?
Dialogue||Eh, I don't know. The only things I've been good at are stealing and helping out Mari n' Ronald. I try to stick with what I know I'm good at.
Dialogue||I'm not JUST a farmer.
Dialogue||I'm someone of many talents.
Dialogue||After the things I've heard about you, I'm inclined not to argue!
Dialogue||Give something new a try sometime.
Dialogue||You lack motivation.
Dialogue||Well... I got a second chance at life, maybe that's a wake up call to, you know, 'find myself' or whatever you want to call it. Alright, I'll think about it!
Dialogue||I'm comfortable with where I am. If that's lacking motivation, then that's how it is.
Dialogue||I work here and there around the city. It ain't always easy, but it brings in the tickets.
Dialogue||Honestly, I wouldn't trade this job for the world!
Dialogue||My game is all about chance. Or is it?
Dialogue||I can tell how strong you are just by looking at you! And through a series of mathematical calculations based on biological observations!
Dialogue||Sometimes my hat gets too soggy and needs to be repaired. I give Triberius a lot of business!
Dialogue||Hello again, XX! My social anxiety sensors indicate that you are interested in casual conversation!
Dialogue||Social anxiety sensors?
Dialogue||Who made you, PAM?
Dialogue||That is correct! I scan each and every individual who approaches. It is in my programming!
Dialogue||Occasionally, someone will approach in search of casual conversation. Of those individuals, 82% show increased activity in chemical receptors associated with anxiety.
Dialogue||A doctor who lives in this town! However, he has requested to remain anonymous. And by "requested," I actually mean he deleted his name from my memory banks!
Dialogue||That's really invasive, PAM.
Dialogue||You're an incredible machine!
Dialogue||I agree! Unfortunately, I am programmed for maximum invasion of personal information.
Dialogue||While it is an unethical breach of trust, it provides me with valuable information pertaining to one's performance in my strength challenges. Yay, science!
Dialogue||Thank you, XX! Your positivity would be infectious to me if I were capable of retaining projected emotions.
Dialogue||That sounds really suspicious...
Dialogue||Why would he want to be anonymous?
Dialogue||It is, indeed! If it eases your suspicion, I can tell you that my creator wanted to keep his identity secret so nobody would ask him to construct another artificial intelligence machine like myself.
Dialogue||That makes me one of a kind!
Dialogue||My creator wanted to keep his identity secret so nobody would ask him to construct another artificial intelligence machine like myself.
Dialogue||Welcome back, dearest.
Dialogue||How long have you lived here?
Dialogue||Is it rude to ask about your appearance?
Dialogue||Me? Why, I've wandered these old forests for years and years... then one day, a city appeared out of nowhere!
Dialogue||It's not in the question, but in how you ask! Don't worry, deares, one can't help one's curiosity. Hee hee hee!
Dialogue||My appearance was altered this way when the ground gave way underfoot one day and I fell into a river! My potions must have spilled, because I left that river with this new face!
Dialogue||Were you upset about that?
Dialogue||Not in the least. Progress moves us forward, after all. Resisting progress is a foolish errand indeed, hee hee hee!
Dialogue||I moved in! Progress moves us forward, after all. Resisting progress is a foolish errand indeed, hee hee hee!
Dialogue||I don't think looks matter that much, anyway.
Dialogue||I think you look fine!
Dialogue||I sure hope they do! Otherwise I'd be out of business - hee hee hee!
Dialogue||Ah... no need to warm an old maiden's heart over a false flame, dearest. I know how I look - and I don't care a wink! Hee hee hee!
Dialogue||If you're not playing, do you mind moving along? I'm trying to get some business here.
Dialogue||I think I lost my helmet again...
Dialogue||I have something for you, but you might not recognize yourself after. Heh heh...
Dialogue||I'm not programmed for gossip, but Arnold performed very poorly in my <b>CHALLENGE MODE</b>.
Dialogue||I prefer not to be bothered, unless you're taking a spin.
Dialogue||I feel like ordering out tonight...
Dialogue||Ready to test your memory? It's harder than you think!
Dialogue||Step right up, step right up! No need to push, there's plenty for everyone!
Dialogue||Sorry, but who are you?
Dialogue||Eh? Wait, you're the only one in line? I thought there'd be way more customers out this way. Ah well...
Dialogue||I'm setting up shop here today, if you don't mind! You don't, do you? Great! I'll be here all day, kid.
Dialogue||Have a look around, and if there's something that's too expensive for you- well, I'll come back around here <i>same time, same day, next month</i>  and you can buy it then! Only the best from Scuzzy W. Bear.
Dialogue||What? Whadd'ya want, kid?
Dialogue||How did you find yourself here?
Dialogue||That's a nice hat!
Dialogue||Eh? What the heck are ya talking about?
Dialogue||I walked here, same as anyone. Say, what kinda scam are you trying to pull here?
Dialogue||Hey, thanks kid! My esteemed colleague Chauncey over there gave it to me as a gift! Didn't mention where he got it, but who cares!
Dialogue||I'm not a scammer!
Dialogue||I was just trying to be polite.
Dialogue||Oh so what, now you're <i>too good</i> for scams? That's it - ya better beat it, kid.
Dialogue||Oh! Sure, right. You were just making conversation, of course, of course. Still, I <i>did</i> walk here, so I don't know what else to tell ya, kid.
Dialogue||Chauncey?
Dialogue||I've met Chauncey, he's a nice guy.
Dialogue||Yeah, he's that blue Slime over there, working the bean counting game. Say, you should give him a bit of business. Tell him I sent ya as thanks for the hat!
Dialogue||You're not wrong, Chauncey is a stand-up guy. Say, you should give him a bit of business. Tell him I sent ya as thanks for the hat!
Dialogue||Hey, you look a little fatigued. Are you getting enough fluids?
Dialogue||Doctor Wornhardt was surprised to hear that I'm new to nursing. He says I'm a natural!
Dialogue||Every night is a good night, don't you think?
Dialogue||But it's always night here.
Dialogue||A cat living in eternal darkness? No wonder you're so happy.
Dialogue||That's exactly right - that's why it's always such a great night!
Dialogue||Yes, this darkness spell is a real treat for me. Thanks to the Moon Dragon, I can hunt whenever I need a meal. No need to wait for sunset when there's no sun!
Dialogue||You don't make sense.
Dialogue||I like your attitude.
Dialogue||So what? Sense... who needs it!
Dialogue||The creatures of the night will always have fun in Withergate. Of course, we're all creatures of the night here.
Dialogue||You don't miss sunshine at all?
Dialogue||If you hunt, what do you need tickets for?
Dialogue||Basking in the sunlight is very relaxing... but I still prefer my perch right up here.
Dialogue||This is the comfiest seat I could find in all of Withergate. I only run the game here because if I don't then people start yelling at me and never leave...
Dialogue||Tickets? I don't use tickets. I'm only here because this is the comfiest seat I could find. I only run the game here because if I don't then people start yelling at me and never leave...
Dialogue||Actually, if you left me alone here I would be <i>purr</i>fectly happy.
Dialogue||Oh, hello there. You look bored. Won't you take a spin on my wheel? Unless you're just here to chat, heheheh.
Dialogue||My name is XX, pleasure to meet you.
Dialogue||So you are looking for a chat after all. My name is Chester.
Dialogue||They call me a "barker" but that seems wrong. I haven't barked a day in my life!
Dialogue||I heard that Cordelia won't ride the ferris wheel 'cause she's afraid of heights!
Dialogue||You can see a lot from the top of the wheel.
Dialogue||You got any tickets? I don't take those little gold things you call coins.
Dialogue||So, what exactly are you?
Dialogue||Why not sell your wares at the town square?
Dialogue||Eh? You telling me you've never seen a traveling merchant before? We're all over the place, kid! I usually work a little bit to the north, but the locals over that way got a little...
Dialogue||...Eh, let's say "worn out" with my products. So I'm taking my show on the road! So many new people to introduce my fantastic wares to!
Dialogue||Heheh... ah, say, that's a good question!
Dialogue||Sounds like you got run out of town.
Dialogue||If you say so...
Dialogue||Run outta...?! What!!
Dialogue||Have you <i>seen</i>  the things I'm selling?! Who would 'run' this out of town, huh? And at such fair prices, too!
Dialogue||<i>(...Jeez, this kid doesn't have me figured out already, do they?...)</i>
Dialogue||<i>(...Nah! They don't suspect a thing, heheh...)</i>
Dialogue||That's the right attitude, kid! And the customer is always right, and you're the customer! Which makes you always right! And you're right!!
Dialogue||So... what's the answer?
Dialogue||Spit it out, bear.
Dialogue||Look, the people around here... they aren't exactly 'ready' for wares as great as mine! When I heard there was a farmer in town, though, I knew they'd be the perfect rube, er...
Dialogue||...I mean, uh, the perfect <i>market partner</i>  to test out the sell-a-bility of my wares!
Dialogue||Hello again, XX. You're the farmer here, right? Be careful out on the field, accidents can happen to anyone!
Dialogue||What made you want to be a nurse?
Dialogue||What do you think of Sun Haven?
Dialogue||My mother is a nurse in my hometown, so maybe that's where the idea started originally. I'm not sure though, helping people just fills me with gratitude. I even journal about it sometimes!
Dialogue||It's a gorgeous little town! I just wish it wasn't so sunny all the time - I get sunburns faster than I can apply sunblock. I'm just grateful to work indoors!
Dialogue||Journaling is too boring for me.
Dialogue||Journaling is a great hobby!
Dialogue||Really? You should give it another shot. It could be a good outlet for all that... attitude.
Dialogue||I think so, too. But it's less of a hobby for me. It's more like a reminder of all the important stuff that I take for granted.
Dialogue||If you don't have a gratitude journal, you should start one!
Dialogue||You really don't like the sunshine?
Dialogue||What kind of weather do you like, then?
Dialogue||I like a sunny day every now and then, just not day after day after day... Give me clouds, and give me rain!
Dialogue||I absolutely <i>live</i> for the rain! Cloudy, overcast days with a nice light rain. That's a perfect day, if you ask me.
Dialogue||Hello! My artificial ocular systems indicate that you can take a punch! What is your name, stranger?
Dialogue||My name's XX. Who are you? Or, what are you?
Dialogue||Hilarious joke! I am a Physical Assessment Machine - but you can call me PAM!
Dialogue||Oh- heh... It's you...
Dialogue||<i>Stephen coughs nervously, not able to find his words for a moment.</i>
Dialogue||Er... say, I never did have a moment to say this, but... thanks for the second chance you gave me back there.
Dialogue||You're welcome for the second chance.
Dialogue||Why turn to crime in the first place?
Dialogue||I promise that my days of poaching are behind me! I didn't mean to harm anyone, especially not any animals or anything like that. It's relieving to be living on the right side of the law!
Dialogue||I want to say that I was a poor young boy who didn't have any choice... but that isn't entirely honest. I have a lot to reflect on now that I've gotten this second chance.
Dialogue||You better be on your best behavior from now on.
Dialogue||We all make mistakes in life.
Dialogue||...Right.
Dialogue||<i>Stephen coughs into his hand, a look of shame on his face.</i>
Dialogue||Boy am I glad you're the forgiving type. I won't let it go to waste, that's a promise!
Dialogue||Welcome to the right side of the law.
Dialogue||I hope you learn that honesty pays.
Dialogue||Heheh. I've got you to thank for that, don't I? Who knew old Stephen would get a second chance.
Dialogue||Heheh. I've got you to thank for the opportunity, don't I? Who knew old Stephen would get a second chance.
Dialogue||My batteries are lunar-powered, so I can run forever!
Dialogue||I've been told I have a mischievous smile.
Dialogue||Think you know yourself well? You can change before you've even realized!
Dialogue||Hi there! I haven't seen you before, have I? My name is Sierra.
Dialogue||Hi Sierra, my name's XX.
Dialogue||XX, got it. Well it's good to meet you, and I hope to see you soon!
Dialogue||But, um, hopefully not in one of our beds...
Dialogue||Hey kid! Think you're quick? I've got the game for you!
Dialogue||What's your name, kid?
Dialogue||My name is XX. What's this game?
Dialogue||Allow me to give you my salutations, XX! I'm Jet, happy to mark ya - I mean <i>meet</i> ya! Heheh...
Dialogue||My game is all about keeping your eye on the ball. If ya wanna play, don't hesitate to step right up!
Dialogue||Nothing can stay in this world - even gold loses its luster.
Dialogue||Remember, every second counts!
Dialogue||Oh yeah... I forgot, to establish trust with a mark- er, I mean, new customer, I'm supposed to ask your name! ...Eh, forget it.
Dialogue||Everybody is looking for a prize...
Dialogue||All this neon light is harsh on my eye...
Dialogue||There's a spot right between my ears that I can never quite scratch...
Dialogue||Test your skills of observation here!
Dialogue||Yer prob'ly wondering, how can he be a good shot with just the one eye? I'll tell you a secret - I'm not!
Dialogue||Who's got a quick eye?
Dialogue||Are you pumped for pumpkins or what?
Dialogue||If it isn't fried, it's not food!
Dialogue||You got a sweet tooth?
Dialogue||If you wanna get pumped, you're in the right place!
Dialogue||Where do you get all these pumpkin things?
Dialogue||Are you an Amari?
Dialogue||Funny story, actually! I was traveling to Withergate from the far west when I saw a little Elf lady in the forest, working on some kind of magic something-or-other.
Dialogue||Well she poured some potion on a squash and it grew the size of a house! So naturally, I snatched that magic potion from under her nose when her back was turned, heheh.
Dialogue||Who, me? No way! I'm a regular old Human, believe it or not. I just got on the bad side of a witch some time ago. Thought I was going to live my whole life as a freak until I heard about this place!
Dialogue||You're a no-good thief.
Dialogue||Lucky find!
Dialogue||Yeah, and? Look, buy a pumpkin or don't.
Dialogue||Exactly! So when I got here, I met up with Dr. Barley and he figured out what was in the potion. Now I can make it do lots of different things!
Dialogue||So you think everyone here is a freak?
Dialogue||You must not be very popular if you talk that way about everyone here.
Dialogue||Of course! Look around you! I'm a freak, he's a freak, she's a freak - we're all freaks! Even you!
Dialogue||You're too sensitive. Nobody else even cares - look around you! I'm a freak, he's a freak, she's a freak - we're all freaks! Even you!
Dialogue||Thank Dynus for this city of freaks!
Dialogue||Hm? What are you looking at?
Dialogue||My name is XX!
Dialogue||I have a name too, it's Malachai. See? You're not special.
Dialogue||I love the people in this town. They really know how to enjoy themselves!
Dialogue||I don't need any employees because I excel at multitasking.
Dialogue||Don't you love the smell of hot fudge?
Dialogue||Hi, sweetie!
Dialogue||What's your favorite part of Withergate?
Dialogue||What's your favorite candy?
Dialogue||I looooooove the ferris wheel. You can see so much from the top!
Dialogue||I can't believe you would approach me so casually with such a big question! This would take hours of consideration to reach a real answer...
Dialogue||... if Fidget hadn't just asked me the same question! I'll tell you what I told him - gummies are my top favorite, followed verrrrry closely by salted caramel!
Dialogue||What ferris wheel?
Dialogue||It's a fun ride!
Dialogue||You really haven't seen it yet? It's above the carnival, just before heading up to the castle.
Dialogue||I can't help but ride it over and over again. I feel like I see a new part of the city each time I ride!
Dialogue||You've tried it? I can't help but ride it over and over again. I feel like I see a new part of the city each time I ride!
Dialogue||Gummies are bad, chocolate is the best.
Dialogue||I love gummies!
Dialogue||Sorry sweetie, but you're just plain wrong!
Dialogue||Then you have impeccable taste, sweetie!
Dialogue||Hello! My name is Denzel, and this is my immaculate fried food stand. Welcome!
Dialogue||Thanks Denzel, my name is XX.
Dialogue||XX! Are you ready to have the meal of a lifetime?? Hahaha!
Dialogue||XX, you're back! I always knew you were a smart customer.
Dialogue||You're really passionate about your food, huh?
Dialogue||Have you been a cook your whole life?
Dialogue||Food is life! Are you not passionate about life!?
Dialogue||A cook? No way! I am an artisanal master of fine cuisine!
Dialogue||Calm down - it's just food.
Dialogue||You're totally right!
Dialogue||Huh. You're not such a smart customer after all, it turns out.
Dialogue||Of course I am! I've been a fry cook for my whole life! You don't go that long frying food without learning what it's all about!
Dialogue||Have you been an artisanal master of fine cuisine your whole life?
Dialogue||It's much easier to say "cook."
Dialogue||No way! Before this, I was a professional thumb wrestler! Before they changed the rules and I was disqualified...
Dialogue||True! It is also much easier to eat food raw, but it is much better fried!
Dialogue||... Okay you can buzz off now.
Dialogue||What are you supposed to be?
Dialogue||Hey, sweetie! I'm Coral. I'm chilled to serve you!
Dialogue||I hope you see something you like, XX!
Dialogue||Everyone needs a little sugar now and then.
Dialogue||If you're not using oil, then you're not cooking!
Dialogue||Don't tell anyone, but Prince Darius sneaks in after hours to get himself a treat!
Dialogue||The sound of sizzling oil is music to my ears.
Dialogue||You know what's the worst? I actually hate the color orange. Too bright.
Dialogue||The world is sweeter with dessert!
Dialogue||Careful - it comes out hot!
Dialogue||Oil stains don't come out easy.
Dialogue||Get pumped!
Dialogue||Take me to the Withergate outskirts.
Dialogue||Haha! XX, you're so weird. Sure, it's a date then. Meet me in the sewers right outside my house by 12:00 tomorrow. I've already got ideas!
Dialogue||Work? I try not to! I just do odd jobs when they come up. And if some treasure happens to cross my path, you can bet I'll take it. A dog's gotta eat, you know.
Dialogue||Great, it's a plan! Meet me tomorrow by the apartment building and we'll go from there. Let's say 12:00 pm!
Dialogue||Honestly, how hard is it to count jellybeans?
Dialogue||I hope you don't think that sounds like too much, XX. I just don't see myself without you anymore.
Dialogue||If I'm not supposed to mix business with my personal life, then I was doomed from the start. How could anyone have a family business like that?
Dialogue||Of course it would. Be at the ferris wheel tomorrow at 5:00 pm. Don't make me wait around, XX...
Dialogue||<i>The buttons of the machine lock up, becoming practically impossible to press down!</i>
Dialogue||Tickle the machine.
Dialogue||Push really, REALLY, hard.
Dialogue||Pull the "REFUND" lever.
Dialogue||<i>Tickle tickle tickle! You tickle the machine with your best tickling techniques. The machine, a cold and unfeeling inanimate object, does not respond.</i>
Dialogue||<i>You're not letting some weird machine get the better of you. You push the button as hard as possible until it gives way with a satisfying click.</i>
Dialogue||<i>You pull a lever labeled "refund". A mechanical buzz emits from within the machine and a length of paper pops out. Grabbing the piece of paper, you read two words: "NO REFUNDS".</i>
Dialogue||<i>Mechanical gears whirr and click into place... something must be working! But then...</i>
Dialogue||<i>The machine dispenses a glob of slimy ectoplasm!</i>
Dialogue||Ignore it.
Dialogue||Shake the machine.
Dialogue||Beg the machine to cooperate.
Dialogue||<i>Was that supposed to scare you? Deter you from your path?? You're getting that potion, and no amount of paranormal goo is going to stop you!!</i>
Dialogue||<i>You shake the machine back and forth, rattling its contents around. It beeps and boops a bit in reaction to the shaking, but refuses to give up its potiony bounty.</i>
Dialogue||<i>You drop to your knees and beg the machine to cooperate. Please, oh please, mighty machine! Give up your potions!</i>
Dialogue||<i>Unsurprisingly, this did not work.</i>
Dialogue||<i>The machine settles down and begins processing your order... something must be working! But then...</i>
Dialogue||<i>The machine goes dark, shutting down completely!</i>
Dialogue||Impress the machine with a yo-yo trick.
Dialogue||Push the machine's "ON" button.
Dialogue||<i>If there's one thing you know would solve this issue, it would be an awesome yo-yo trick.</i>
Dialogue||<i>...Unfortunately, you have neither a yo-yo nor the ability to do a cool yo-yo trick.</i>
Dialogue||<i>You pull out another ticket and attempt to feed it into the machine... but the machine is off. It doesn't work, and you don't walk away with a potion.</i>
Dialogue||<i>You take a look behind the machine, spotting a big red button labeled "ON". You press it and, by some crazy miracle, the machine boots back to life and pops out your potion!</i>
Dialogue||<i>Whatever you did, it worked! Sweet victory! Enjoy your potion!</i>
Dialogue||<i>The machine refuses to take your ticket!</i>
Dialogue||Try another ticket.
Dialogue||<i>You break down and begin all out ugly crying. Why, why oh why! Why must the world be so cruel?!</i>
Dialogue||<i>Upon closer inspection, you realize you were trying to feed the machine a candy wrapper, not a ticket. Silly you. You produce a proper ticket and feed it into the machine, no problem.</i>
Dialogue||<i>The machine becomes ghostly and immaterial! Your hand passes straight through it!</i>
Dialogue||Write a formal complaint.
Dialogue||Call the Specter Squishers.
Dialogue||<i>Grabbing a quill and parchment, you draft out a strongly worded letter that details, in great length, the hardship and difficulty that the machine has dealt to you.</i>
Dialogue||<i>The machine, incapable of reading anything, is unmoved by your letter.</i>
Dialogue||<i>Who are you going to call? The Specter Squishers, that's who. You give them a call and they show right up, restoring the ghostly machine back to physical form. What a great bunch of guys.</i>
Dialogue||<i>You attempt to tickle the machine, but it's no good! Your tickles pass straight through its intangible form. Curses! Bested once again!</i>
Dialogue||<i>The machine relequinishes the potion, and instead of falling down where you can grab it, the potion floats inside the machine!</i>
Dialogue||Plant some seeds in the machine.
Dialogue||<i>Oh no, you're not getting away that easy! You shake the machine, knocking the potion about. Whatever is causing the potion to levitate fails to withstand your onslaught, and down the potion goes!</i>
Dialogue||<i>You pull out a spare pack of seeds and dump them down the ticket slot. You stare at the machine and your floating potion, waiting for something to happen. Nothing ever does.</i>
Dialogue||<i>You decide to woo the machine with one of your famous yo-yo tricks. However, you suddenly remember that you don't have a yo-yo. Also, you don't know any yo-yo tricks.</i>
Dialogue||<i>A gaggle of ghosts fly out of the machine, taunting you!</i>
Dialogue||Exercise the machine.
Dialogue||Exorcise the machine.
Dialogue||Sigh loudly.
Dialogue||<i>You hype the machine up, attempting to get it to run a few laps around the city with you... but the machine doesn't do so much as budge an inch. Ghosts must not respond to exercising.</i>
Dialogue||<i>You quickly chant powerful words of exorcism. "Be gone, ghosts. Get out of here. Leave. Go away."</i>
Dialogue||<i>It works! The ghosts take off, the exorcism was a success!</i>
Dialogue||<i>You throw your arms up and sigh with abandon. The ghosts make fun of you. Oh, and you never get your potion.</i>
Dialogue||<i>The machine falls into a portal leading to another dimension!</i>
Dialogue||Wait it out.
Dialogue||Go in after it.
Dialogue||Dance awkardly.
Dialogue||<i>You're not going in that weird cross-dimensional portal. You decide to wait right there for the machine to reappear.</i>
Dialogue||<i>...After awhile, it dawns on you that maybe waiting won't do any good.</i>
Dialogue||<i>Refusing to go away empty handed, you boldly leap into the portal and follow the wayward machine.</i>
Dialogue||<i>What occurs next is an epic adventure spanning a strange and wonderful new world... though upon reappearing back in Withergate, you lose all memory of your escapades.</i>
Dialogue||<i>You attempt to appease the dimensional portal with a dance. Flailing your arms and legs about, you do an awful dance number. All you accomplished was embarassing yourself.</i>
Dialogue||<i>You're glad that's all over. The machine begins to cooperate, so something must be working! But then...</i>
Dialogue||<i>Your potion begins to drop down... and gets stuck against the glass!</i>
Dialogue||Attempt to befriend the machine.
Dialogue||Do your best Emmett impression.
Dialogue||<i>Stupid machine! You give it a solid punch. Your fingers hurt, but your potion is dislodged!</i>
Dialogue||<i>You suggest that you and the machine could put your differences aside and become friends. The machine declines your offer of friendship. Wow, what a jerk!</i>
Dialogue||<i>You channel your inner-Emmett and begin complaining about your busy work schedule. It's not the best impression ever, and gets you nowhere with the machine.</i>
Dialogue||<i>You press one of the buttons, but the machine registers a different input!</i>
Dialogue||Pretend to be Dynus.
Dialogue||Randomly press buttons.
Dialogue||Call a manager.
Dialogue||<i>You pretend that you are the mighty Moon Dragon, Dynus himself. You command the machine to obey your words, but you must be a pretty lousy actor because it doesn't work.</i>
Dialogue||<i>Losing your patience, you press every single button on the machine in random order. Finally, the machine yields and registers your initial input.</i>
Dialogue||<i>Can you get a manager over here?! ...Well?! Huh?!?! A manager?!??!?</i>
Dialogue||<i>Guess not. Darn.</i>
Dialogue||<i>The inner mechanisms of the machine seem to settle down a bit... something must be working! But then...</i>
Dialogue||<i>The machine flips upside down!</i>
Dialogue||Stand on your head.
Dialogue||Jump on top of the machine.
Dialogue||<i>Two can play at that game! You fall forwards, meeting the ground with the top of your head. Now the controls are all right-side up! Or at least, they look that way. You're able to operate the machine as normal.</i>
Dialogue||<i>You jump onto the top of the machine, which is actually the bottom of the machine, as it is currently upside down. It's sort of cool to see what the bottom of the vending machine looks like, but it doesn't do any good.</i>
Dialogue||Scribble an angry message on the machine.
Dialogue||<i>You suplex the machine, landing it right side up. Success! Except... the force of the suplex broke all the potions inside... they magically reform back together, but still refuse to come out.</i>
Dialogue||<i>Was that supposed to scare you? Deter you from your path?? You're getting that potion, and no amount of paranormal goo is going to stop you!! You wipe away the ectoplasm, revealing your potion underneath!</i>
Dialogue||<i>You lose your temper and take up a marker, writing an unpleasent message on the side of the machine.</i>
Dialogue||<i>The machine, still upside down, flips right side up just as soon as your finished writing your message. Great, now no one can read it!</i>
Dialogue||Push the button really, REALLY, hard.
Dialogue||Tell the machine a funny story.
Dialogue||<i>You regale the machine with a retelling of the time you stepped on a dragon's tail, but the machine doesn't seem to be listening. Or capable of hearing, for that matter.</i>
Dialogue||<i>You pull out a pack of seeds. You slip the tiny seeds into the ticket slot, following them down with a bit of water. You are unsure what this accomplished.</i>
Dialogue||<i>You take a look behind the machine, spotting a big red button labeled "ON". You press it and, by some crazy miracle, the machine boots back to life.</i>
Dialogue||<i>You pull a shiny stack of tickets from your pocket. Slipping it towards the machine, you throw in a little sweet talk to flavor the deal. The machine takes the tickets, but doesn't respond to the bribe.</i>
Dialogue||Ask for an exchange.
Dialogue||<i>Ignoring something is the best way to get it to go away. You ignore the portal, that eventually closes up on its own. The only issue is that it took the machine with it.</i>
Dialogue||<i>You ask the portal if it would please exchange you a new vending machine. The portal fizzles for a bit, and then closes. You stand awkwardly, wondering when that exchange is going to get here.</i>
Dialogue||<i>Wrestling the vending machine back into Withergate, it finally releases a potion!</i>
Dialogue||Give it a smooch.
Dialogue||<i>You cross your arms and plant your feet firmly to the ground. You'll wait this little mishap out.</i>
Dialogue||<i>...You get tired of waiting.</i>
Dialogue||<i>You pucker up and plant a big, wet kissy on the machine. It doesn't do anything, but several onlookers give you some strange looks.</i>
Dialogue||<i>Sparks begin shooting wildly out of the interface of the machine!</i>
Dialogue||Threaten the machine with your weapons.
Dialogue||<i>You give the machine a good shake. You think you can hear some of the inner metal bits bending and breaking, but it gets the sparks to stop flying.</i>
Dialogue||<i>Alright, vending machine! No more Mister Nice Farmer. Give up the potion, or else!!</i>
Dialogue||<i>The machine must have nerves of steel, because it doesn't even so much as flinch at your threats. Oh well!</i>
Dialogue||<i>The machine vanishes into thin air!</i>
Dialogue||Find it with feel.
Dialogue||Make tea.
Dialogue||<i>You attempt to draft an anger-filled message on the side of the machine, but it's invisible and so you can't see what you're writing. You're pretty sure it's good and angry, though.</i>
Dialogue||<i>The machine may be invisible to the naked eye, but you can still use your hands to feel around for it... a button here, a knob there... yeah, this'll work. Out comes the potion!</i>
Dialogue||<i>You brew a lovely pot of tea. It's very relaxing and calms your nerves, but you find it very much lacking as a substitute for a potion.</i>
Dialogue||<i>Slime begins dripping down every side of the machine!</i>
Dialogue||Grab a tissue.
Dialogue||<i>You stand on your head. You get slime on your head. This was a bad idea.</i>
Dialogue||<i>Ooooh, haunted slime conjured by spirits not of this earthly realm. How scaaary... yeah, right. You grab a hankie and wipe off the slime. Ever onward.</i>
Dialogue||<i>You give the machine a good, long dose of the dreaded 'stink eye'. Meanwhile, slime pools around your ankles. You don't think the stink eye treatment worked.</i>
Dialogue||<i>The machine mixes all of the potions around!</i>
Dialogue||<i>With a grip to rival the greatest of Guardian Dragons you heft the machine up off the ground a good inch or two. You then let it fall back down. All the potions inside conveniently rearrange themselves back to normal!</i>
Dialogue||<i>You loudly sigh. It accomplishes nothing, so you give it another try. Still nothing. Sigh.</i>
Dialogue||<i>You tickle the machine. It laughs, and all the potions rearrange! But they're still in the wrong order!</i>
Dialogue||Pretend the machine works.
Dialogue||<i>In your deepest and most booming voice, you command the machine to obey your will. The machine, unphased by your acting ability, refuses to comply.</i>
Dialogue||<i>You spend a few moments living inside of a fantasy land in your head, where the machine works perfectly. It didn't change reality, however, and your potion is still stuck!</i>
Dialogue||<i>A giant bat suddenly flies in your way!</i>
Dialogue||Shoo it away.
Dialogue||<i>You begin a very awkward dance, flailing your arms around with abandon. The bat looks at you with utter disapproval. You both know you don't deserve a potion for this.</i>
Dialogue||<i>You shoo the big hairy bat away, who apologizes for getting in your way. He seems like a nice guy, really.</i>
Dialogue||<i>From your vantage point atop the machine, you watch the bat insert his own ticket into the machine... and receive his potion without any trouble. You reflect on the unfairness of life.</i>
Dialogue||<i>You recount to the machine a story of the time your home in the Great City was suddenly flooded with uncooked cake batter, from a bakery explosion down the street. The machine doesn't even smirk at the hilarious tale.</i>
Dialogue||<i>The machine suddenly shrinks, turning as tiny as a mouse!</i>
Dialogue||Press every button at once.
Dialogue||Threaten to squish it.
Dialogue||<i>You pull another ticket out of your pocket and attempt to feed it into the machine. The machine, having shrunk to roughly the size of the ticket, is much too small to accept it. Too bad you don't have any tiny tickets.</i>
Dialogue||<i>You press every single button at once. Considering it's so tiny, you're able to do it with one finger. No tiny potions come out, though.</i>
Dialogue||<i>Is this the machine's grand plan? Because if it is, it's a really dumb one. You raise your foot above it, threatening to smoosh it to smithereens. It gets the hint, and grows back to normal, and out pops your potion!</i>
Dialogue||<i>You leap onto the machine in one bounding motion. Oh, yuck! Now your feet are covered in slime!</i>
Dialogue||<i>You plead with the machine to please turn back from its slime-covered ways. Considering the slime doesn't stop, you'd guess it didn't work.</i>
Dialogue||<i>Sparks, slime. Nothing will deter you from claiming your rightful reward. You shake the machine back and forth until the sparks subside. On the bright side of things, they burned away all the slime!</i>
Dialogue||<i>You tip the machine over. It is now covered in slime, emitting sparks and tipped on its side. It's... quite the sight to behold. But you still don't get a potion from it.</i>
Dialogue||<i>Holding to the theory that there is no problem that can't be solved by suplexing it, you suplex the machine and drive it into the ground. It looked pretty cool, but it didn't result in a potion.</i>
Dialogue||<i>You let loose and scream, raging against the machine. All it does is give you a sore throat, though. A potion would really help with that, if only you had one...</i>
Dialogue||<i>The machine eats your ticket!</i>
Dialogue||Fish it back out.
Dialogue||<i>You put a second ticket in the machine. It eats that ticket, too. You're not sure what else you were expecting to happen.</i>
Dialogue||<i>You scream like a madman at the machine, ranting and raving. It feels good to get it all out, but it didn't get you a potion.</i>
Dialogue||<i>You grab a stick from the ground and jam it squarely into the ticket slot of the machine. Wrenching the stick around, you reclaim your ticket!
Dialogue||You feed the ticket back into the slot, and this time the machine knows better than to cross you.</i>
Dialogue||<i>The machine begins to float, levitating off of the ground!</i>
Dialogue||Stand up on your tippytoes.
Dialogue||<i>The machine seems a bit heavy for whatever force is lifting it. Standing up on your toes is more than enough height to reach the control panel again.</i>
Dialogue||<i>You take a good swing at the machine, but it floats out of the way. You have to confess that the machine made you look quite the fool.</i>
Dialogue||<i>You beg the machine to land back on the ground, but it merely responds by floating even higher. This clearly isn't going to work out in your favor.</i>
Dialogue||<i>The machine turns into a frog!</i>
Dialogue||<i>You call the frog's manager. It's another frog. Of course it is.</i>
Dialogue||<i>A vending machine turning into a frog is weird, but <b>kissing</b> a vending machine that turned into a frog is definitely even weirder.</i>
Dialogue||<i>But, hey, the frog turns back into a machine and out comes the potion! Totally worth it. ...Right?</i>
Dialogue||<i>You attempt to deliver a swift kick to the machine, but it hops out of the way. You try again, only for your kick to once again be dodged. Ribbit.</i>
Dialogue||<i>You fall silent. Closing your eyes, you let inner-tranquility wash over you. You are a still leaf in a raging pond...</i>
Dialogue||<i>You summon strength, deep from within...</i>
Dialogue||<i>You channel all of that strength... directly to your leg...</i>
Dialogue||<i>...And let loose with an earth-shattering, sky-splitting kick that no man or beast could deny!!!</i>
Dialogue||<i>...Ow! Your foot hurts, and the machine seems utterly unphased.</i>
Dialogue||<i>You begin to recount to the invisible machine a tale all about the time you mistook Lucia for a red-tailed horse. Several onlookers stare at you with concern and worry.</i>
Dialogue||<i>You attempt to jump on top of the machine... but owing to the fact that it's invisible, you miss your footing and fall into a puddle. How unpleasent.</i>
Dialogue||<i>The machine may be invisible to the naked eye, but you can still use your hands to feel around for it... a button here, a knob there... yeah, this'll work.</i>
Dialogue||<i>Oh no, your potion isn't getting away that easy! You shake the machine, knocking the potion about. Whatever is causing the potion to levitate fails to withstand your onslaught, and down the potion goes!</i>
Dialogue||<i>Maybe one of these buttons is the "stop floating" button? Maybe ALL OF THEM ARE?? You press every single button all at once, but still the potion floats.</i>
Dialogue||Pour a watering can on the machine.
Dialogue||<i>The machine seems to be a bit heavy for whatever force is lifting it. Standing up on your toes is more than enough height to reach the control panel again.</i>
Dialogue||<i>If machines do not desire to obey, then they shall be punished. You dump the contents of a watering can all over the mischevious, floating machine. Now it's wet AND floating, which doesn't solve your problem.</i>
Dialogue||Shield yourself.
Dialogue||<i>En garde, ye sniveling cur! If you choose the path of deviousness, then prepare to battle! ...The machine doesn't respond to your requests for combat.</i>
Dialogue||<i>The tiny sparks sting a little, but they don't really hurt. You shield your eyes and face from the worst of the sparking, and continue on your quest.</i>
Dialogue||<i>You lower your voice to a deep growl, impersonating the Moon Dragon to the best of your talents. You command respect and subservience from the machine. You thought it was a pretty good impersonation, but it doesn't work.</i>
Dialogue||<i>Plucking up a convienently placed nearby marker, you scribble a colorful message that lets the world know just how you feel about this #$&@! machine.</i>

<i>Your 1st Sun Haven Pen Pal letter comes from Peter</i>
'Hoy! I did this whole pen pal thing because I thought I'd have lots to say. Honestly, though, now that I'm sitting down and writing... I'm not entirely sure what I want to say. It's good to pass the time while fishing, though. Gotta keep your mind sharp between bites, otherwise you'll nod off and miss.<page>
<i>The writing stops here, at a splash of ink. It continues directly below.</i>
Er, sorry about that, pen pal. Just had a bite. Anyways, I'm not so sure this whole pen pal thing is going to work out for me. Hope you have better luck with it.
<i>Your 2nd Sun Haven Pen Pal letter comes from Camila</i>
Hello! I've always enjoyed writing letters, but I've never had a lot of people to write them to! I was so excited when I heard we were going to set up a pen pal program, it's such a perfect idea to share letters and stories with one another.
I don't know if you know or not, but I host guests in an extra room. Get this - the other week I had Demons staying with me! I wasn't sure if my normal old room was going to be comfortable for them, but they actually enjoyed their stay and were very polite. Strange to say, but I guess you have to be ready to give anyone a bed when you're in a business like mine. It's certainly fun to see new people, though. Sun Haven seems to have plenty of that, it's always made me wonder what it is about this town that attracts different kinds of people. Isn't that interesting?
Finding time to sit down and write your thoughts is a privilege, I hope you'll agree. Okay well, take care of yourself!
<i>Your 3rd Sun Haven Pen Pal letter comes from Emmett</i>
I don't have a lot of time to write, I'm even skipping lunch for this because Bernard said this was good for the community.
Guess what! I'm getting close to saving enough gold to pay off my debts! But I'll keep working hard after they're paid off. The difference is, then I'll be saving up for myself! I've always dreamed of having a nice house of my own with a luxurious bathtub and a biiiiiig soft bed... So, I can see the light at the end of the tunnel now.
I'm already running out of time here. Lunch breaks never last long enough, do they?
<i>Your 4th Sun Haven Pen Pal letter comes from Pod</i>
hi  it  is  me  pod  i  am  writing  this  to  say  hi . my  mama  says  penpails  like  to  write  to  each  other  but  i  don,t  like  to  write

mama  says  i  have  to  write  and  cant  just  draw.  she works  realy  hard  all  day . i  wish  someone  could  bring  her  dinner  onse.
<i>Your 5th Sun Haven Pen Pal letter comes from Amanda</i>
Salutations. I don't know who you are, but I'm going to assume that you're someone with whom I can discuss books. Honestly, I don't even care if you read this letter or not - I just have to get this off my chest.
I recently finished a novel by Harriet T. T. Gerning. It was HTTG's most recent publication and, really, HTTG's works are critically overrated. Her narrative threads end up going nowhere and she spends hundreds of pages building up to, ultimately, zero payoff.
Honestly, I should just quit this library job and review books for a living! The newspapers of the Great City would go to war with each other over the rights to my critiques. Anyways, I hope you appreciate my astute opinions. Regardless, I'm pretending that you do.
<i>Your 6th Sun Haven Pen Pal letter comes from Raimi</i>
Hey, I don't know much about pen pals but this seems like the perfect opportunity to spread some word on the situation around Sun Haven. The leafy monsters grow in number each day. It's like they grow on trees or something. If you ever find yourself surrounded by them, keep your cool. They're dangerous, but small. I consider the leafy problem to be threat level: Green.
I've been running into these massive purple monsters lately, as well. They seem to slumber at all times, but I'm sure once they awaken they'll be up to no good. I've attempted to defeat one, but all of my arrows merely disappeared into its fur. And it didn't even wake up! When I got closer to investigate, it slapped me away in its sleep. I consider these beasts to be threat level: Double Red.
Any information on dealing with these purple menaces should be reported to me, and the Sun Haven guard. It's only a matter of time until one of them wakes up, and then there's no telling what nefarious plot could unravel.
<i>Your 7th Sun Haven Pen Pal letter comes from Ronald</i>
Fancy some quality food? In need of some good company? Why don't you come on down to the tavern and we'll get everything sorted for you. Ah, I'm sorry. Mari told me that if I was going to mess around writing letters for a pen pal that I had to advertise the tavern. What did you think of the sales pitch, though? Did it tempt you to pay a visit? Oh well, how are things going with you? Things at the tavern are busy as ever, we can't seem to keep enough food and drink on hand to serve everyone. It's good to complain about having too much, though, don't you think? Sun Haven isn't the biggest town on the map, but I'm glad we can count ourselves as one of the most prosperous, even in the face of everything.
Come by the tavern and I'll get you a meal sometime, on the house.
P.S. - Don't tell Mari about the 'on the house' part
<i>Your 8th Sun Haven Pen Pal letter comes from Tonya</i>
I used to do pen pal stuff when I was a little girl. Well, my mother would make me do it. I never really wanted to, but she insisted. To help my penmanship, she said... I guess my handwriting <i>was</i> pretty awful at first. Mother told me penmanship was like running - you have to keep at it if you want to improve your mile time. Or, something like that. My handwriting did get better, of course. After all that practice it <i>had</i> to. Who knows, maybe she was right. Heh, that's strange. I haven't thought about my mother this much in a long time! Maybe I should write her a letter, too.
Okay, it's decided. Topi will start his penmanship exercises tomorrow morning! He'll hate it, but his handwriting is <i>atrocious</i>.
My hand is cramping up, better stretch it out. I'll sign off here - thanks, penpal! Maybe I'll see you when I deliver this letter.
<i>Your 9th Sun Haven Pen Pal letter comes from Judith</i>
When I first heard that Sun Haven was going to establish a pen pal network, I thought it would prove to be a waste of time. I suppose after seeing how many people are participating in it, however, I must say I was quite wrong. I underestimated my fellow townsfolk and their interest in ink and paper. When I was young we'd have plenty of festivals that brought us together, but as time went on the town grew too busy. There was simply no time for such frequent festivities. Writing to one another has helped the town feel more connected once again... so I'm glad that even as I'm now retired, Sun Haven still reminds me of the good old days.
Oh, perhaps we can do more festivals, too? Ah, a young girl can dream, at least. Oh- I know, I'll have Albert pen you some words.
<i>The words cut out, followed on the next line by more writing in a considerably sloppier hand</i>.
Hello, I'm not great with writing but Judith really wants me to give it a go. So, here's a joke. What does an envelope say when you lick it? Nothing, it shuts up. Oh, now Judith is giving me a look. Stay safe, pen pal.
and Albert
<i>Your final Sun Haven Pen Pal letter comes from Bernard</i>
You've been a member of our pen pal exchange for some time now and have received quite a few letters from our residents. At this very moment, many people in the program are still sending and receiving correspondence. I've also been working with Jun to measure the individual responses of the participants in the program. It seems that most people who wrote letters described feeling more "interconnected" within their community, as Jun put it.
Therefore, I am proud to declare that Sun Haven's pen pal program has been an overall success in our little community!
Thank you for helping Sun Haven write, it truly has brought our community together. It means a lot to me, to the Archmage, and to everyone involved in our pen pal program.
- Warmest regards, Bernard
<i>As you reach the end of the letter, you realize there is a surprise attached to the end of the parchment...</i>
<i>(An usually large scroll of paper sticks out of the mailbox, on the outside of the scroll are two words: "from snaccoons"... unscrolling the rough parchment reveals a message.)</i>
"thank you, farmer. when snacoons not sleeping, snaccoons watch you. you do lots of good for forest. fight monsters and clean up. snaccoons like you."
<i>(The letter is signed with a large paw print, using smooshed berries as ink...)</i>
<i>(An usually large scroll of paper sticks out of the mailbox, on the outside of the scroll are three words: "from snaccoons again"... unscrolling the rough parchment reveals a message.)</i>
"not many in forests anymore, farmer. you go through forest with no fear, snaccoon like seeing others enjoy forest like we do."
<i>(The letter is signed with two large paw prints, this time it looks like they used a raspberry)</i>
That's a lot of eggs! Much obliged, farmer. I'm glad some people around here still care about chivalry. Here's a reward for your trouble.
Albert is eating a lot of <color=#39CCFF>eggs</color> these days, but he's all out. Bring Albert 6 <color=#39CCFF>eggs</color> so he can continue his diet.

Pod's pen pal letter mentioned that his mother, Kara, is always working hard. He thinks it would be nice if someone made her dinner just once. I should talk to Pod and see what his mama would like to eat.
Asking Pod
Ah, so you got that pen pal letter I wrote? I was wondering if anyone would ever end up reading it, heh... Oh wait, don't tell me. You're here about that free meal, aren't you?
Haha, well you came to the right place. Honestly, it was kind of fun writing that letter. Never thought much would come of it, but just being able to share my thoughts with a pen pal was a liberating experience.
No pressure to keep up conversation, just writing down what I think for someone else to read. Heh, maybe I could become a writer someday.
Anyways, I'll save the rest of my speech for my next book. Here farmer, here's a Cheeseburger on the house.
Ronald has offered to give me a free meal at the Sun Haven Tavern. I should take him up on the offer by visiting the Tavern.

It doesn't feel right to judge a town by the money it makes you.
I can appreciate a business-minded person like yourself.
The Blacksmith's Apprentice
I'm sure you'll become a master one day, too.
If you think this is a big city, you're really clueless!
I'm adjusting, too. You'll get used to it in no time.
I can't believe anyone doubted you.
I'll do whatever I can to help our town.
I'm here for myself. I can't make any promises about the town.
Wow, thanks! I'm XX, glad to meet you, doctor.
That's right - wait, how did you know my name?
Ah, Sun Haven. Of course. I'm Vaan, and it's a true pleasure to meet you.
I'm just saying you could loosen up a bit.
You handle yourself well, even under all that pressure.
I'll do it!
That's right, I'm the farmer. My name's XX.
Pleasure to meet you, Liam. I'm XX.
What makes them stand out from other soldiers?
It's comforting to have you here.
Somehow, that makes me feel less safe.
So you're the prince of Withergate?
What exactly do you do here?
Someone woke up on the wrong side of the bed this morning.
I beg forgiveness, my prince.
Well if you're not an advisor then what is your job?
Sun Haven has security...
That's not very nice.
I'm surprised a rude monster like you has any place in this town.
You better be on your best behavior from now on.
We all make mistakes in life.
You don't have to be so sarcastic.
You're pretty funny!
You could be a guard, too!
It sounds like this place would be completely helpless without him.
I can do that for you.

Arts & Expression
Elven culture is centered around artistic expression in many forms. Foremost is woodcraft - Elves are considered the most careful and skilled woodworkers to exist worldwide. Horticulture - the art of trimming and shaping plants - is also a celebrated form of expression. 
Elves have also been known to paint symbols of cultural significance on their houses as well. These symbols can be sigils of health and peace as well as low enchantments for protection and luck. The same symbols are carried over into their rich tradition of tattooing, which is a sign of spiritual maturity among Elves.
Cultural Values
<i>Nature & Harmony</i>
Elven values are based on the teachings of Nel'Vari's guardian dragon, Nivara. Nivara, also called the World Dragon, teaches the power of peace and harmony with nature. Her connection with nature allows her to practice advanced magical abilities.
<i>Protective Secrecy</i>
Being the peaceful people they are, Elves have historically been trusting of other cultures. This trust, unfortunately, has led to catastrophe within Nel'Vari. In response, the Elves of Nel'Vari have taken a position of secrecy, allowing only select guests to walk within the city's boundaries. The city itself is protected by an illusion that prevents potential foes from ever finding it.

I've got to say, I wasn't expecting you to ask me out. Most people think of doing it but never actually do! At least, I assume they think about doing it.
I'm glad you agreed to this.
Hey, I'm not as unapproachable as some people think. I'm just glad you had the guts to ask!
So you took a calculated risk? That's a good move! And I'd say it's paying off.
What, didn't you want me to? Well tough, you're stuck with me at this point, even if it's just one date.
I knew you'd say yes.
I didn't think you'd say yes.
Things were getting pretty dull, you know. In Sun Haven. You moved here just in time to save me from complete boredom.
I'm glad you took over that farm instead of someone completely pointless.
So XX, keep me interested! Ask me a question.
Anne, is there anything you care about as much as your business?
Well, sure. I mean... probably? Actually, I don't know if I've ever thought about that. Never seemed to matter before!
Why would it? My business is my number one priority - you know that, XX. But times change, people change, and I'm no fortune-teller. Who knows what's in my future!
Why would it? My business is my number one priority - you know that, XX.
I guess it doesn't really matter.
It should matter.
All right, farmer, it's my turn to ask you a question. Is this new life working for you? I mean, do you enjoy it?
Absolutely! This life is exactly what I wanted.
It's not quite what I expected.
You know what's funny about you, XX? I never wonder if you're telling the truth. I've met a lot of questionable folk in my travels, but you are more genuine than most.
I won't lie, XX - that's totally cheesy! But I don't mind. It's a nice change of pace from the people I've seen in the past.
Well NOW it sounds like you're lying...
I just want you to know who I really am.
I've never lied once in my life.
Not to be a stick in the mud, but it's getting a little late and I still have to tally today's profits. What do you say we wrap it up?
Typical. I guess that's what I should expect from a farmer - no class.
You're a class act! I actually had a good time, too.
Thanks for a fun date, XX. I'll see you around!
Sure thing. Can you cover the bill?
I'll pay for us both.
So, I wanted you to know that I finally went to see Elios.
How did it go?
It was actually really nice!
I thought it was just going to be lots of magical mumbo-jumbo, but everything he told me was really helpful.
I'm not Blessed though, if that's what you're wondering.
Me too! He gave some perspective on a lot of mixed feelings I have about my past.
Like I said, his words were helpful. You know that not all help comes from magic, right XX?
I'm just glad it went well!
What good is it if he doesn't give you his blessing?
It's strange... Elios knew things about my past that I haven't told hardly anyone here. Not even you, XX.
You can tell me, what is it?
I usually try to avoid talking about it but I think you deserve to know what happened... on my island before I moved here.
Please XX, I really want to talk about this with you.
Thank you for making this easy, XX.
I'm not sure I want to know.
I'm listening.
I had a patient on the island before I left, my last patient in the Southern Islands. She was the daughter of the mayor, well-known and beloved by the whole island.
She had a sickness that I treated for years but never could figure out.
She only got worse over time. She never blamed me, though. She actually gave me a gift for good luck - a dreamcatcher. I still have it. She became a good friend, actually.
What did you do?
I'm so sorry, Wornhardt.
My colleagues looked at the case and couldn't figure it out either. Then one day, she just passed in her sleep.
Her parents blamed me, which I understand. But because her father was the mayor, the whole island turned against me too. I was much younger at the time and I couldn't take it.
So I left the islands and eventually found Sun Haven. The ordeal stuck with me though. I even started thinking, maybe they were right and it was my fault.
I've been learning how to deal with it better, over time. The windmills help. And so do you, XX.
I know that now. Like I said, Elios helped a lot. But it's nice to hear from you, too.
I know what I did wasn't brave, but it's what I had to do. I don't regret it.
You did what you had to do.
Running away was the wrong call.
There's something else I realized from my talk with Elios. Even if I'm not ready to move past what happened, I can still make myself happy. And for me, that starts with you, XX!
The time I spend with you makes me happier than I've ever been. Will you have me as your boyfriend?
Oh, thank goodness! Not many things can scare a doctor, but I was terrified just now!
XX, I'm sorry to cut this short but I have an early morning tomorrow. Plus, I want to leave this on a positive ending.
Thank you for listening so much. You're really the best! Goodnight XX, I'll see you soon.
Oh... Really? I thought we were getting along so well... but if that's how you feel, then I have to respect that.
XX, it's about time we wrapped up this date. I have an early morning tomorrow. Thank you for listening so much.
You're really the best. Goodnight.
Yes, of course I will!
I'm sorry Wornhardt, that's not what I want.
This was a nice idea, XX. Thank you for suggesting it. I often forget to take time for myself, so I appreciate a reminder now and again.
It's important to relax once in a while.
Of course, I know that. Still, it's difficult to justify it to myself when there's so much left to do in Sun Haven.
I've only held my role as Archmage for five years, you know. Yes, I began right in the middle of Sun Haven's decline. The worst of it, I suppose you could say.
Because of that, I guess I have trouble keeping this town out of mind.
A vacation, at a time like this? I can't quite tell if you're joking. You can rest assured that I'm not going anywhere, however.
I certainly hope you wouldn't! I'm only doing the best I can.
It sounds like you could use a vacation.
I guess I can't blame you for being a caring leader.
Did you know I was only nineteen when I took on this responsibility? There was nobody else to do the job, and I would not stand by to let my town perish. I was forced to grow up quite a bit. Something about that got stuck in my head.
Do you wish you had done things differently?
I don't blame myself for anything. Like I said, I've done my best. I only wish I could go back with the knowledge I have now and do it over again. Have you ever felt that way?
I see. Perhaps I shouldn't focus on it, then. No point in entertaining pointless thoughts, anyway.
Oh good, it isn't just me!
I can't say that I have.
I know exactly how you feel.
This is becoming a real journey into my head! I'm never so self-reflective. You have a way of bringing my thoughts elsewhere, XX.
That's a good thing, right?
I hope I'm not distracting you.
Don't worry, I love letting my mind wander when it can. I suppose I'm saying that I'm grateful to have someone like you around.
Do you mean on another date? I'll refrain from making any promises, but I think the chances are in your favor!
XX, this is the one case where I'm directly telling you to distract me from my responsibilities. Would you deny me so easily?
I hope I can help you out like this again, soon!
I shouldn't distract you from your responsibilities.
It feels as though the evening is coming to an end, wouldn't you say?
Are you ready to go now, XX?
Thank you for the night out, XX. I suspect we'll get to know each other even better soon enough.
I'll see you soon!
This has been a nice break for me, but I have to go back to work tomorrow morning. As do you, if you recall.
I had fun getting a peek inside your head.
Forget that, let's stay together.
I hope you don't mind this spot even though it's not very far from home. The flowers and the soft breeze are just so peaceful.
I'm not surprised you'd choose a spot surrounded by plants!
Am I so predictable? Oh well, I guess there are worse things to be.
Good news for me, apparently. I promise that I can be spontaneous, too!
I guess that's... good to know.
I don't mind predictable.
Predictability is boring.
I think I've gotten to know you faster than anyone else in town, XX. I feel so open with you.
I don't think there's anything I wouldn't tell you about myself at this point. Do you know what I mean?
You can ask me whatever you want, too.
Okay then, do you think living here has changed you?
Yeah? I've seen it happen to a lot of people that way. I'm glad to see Sun Haven agrees with you. Maybe you'll stick around for a while.
Ah, well I guess that means it hasn't really hit you yet.
Definitely, and for the better.
How do you mean?
I know you are Blessed, so I have to wonder... What does magic mean to you, XX?
Magic is a delicate relationship.
Magic is a powerful responsibility.
You think so? I always thought of it like a natural part of the world, just like the river and flowers.
Hm, okay. I guess I'll explain. Magic is just a part of nature, but it's everywhere. It's like having an ocean all around you. I'm surprised you don't get that.
Thanks! I like your take on it, too. Everybody finds their own understanding of magic one way or another, but not many people learn to actually use it.
XX, I'm glad we both share a connection with magic.
I don't follow.
That's beautiful, Catherine.
Well, I'm getting sore from this bench. And I have a cauldron on the fire that needs stirring or it might... well, explode. Are you ready to go?
Haha, you're so very considerate!
This was a lot of fun, XX. Thanks for taking me out!
Okay, but only so your house doesn't explode.
I'm ready.
Here we are. This is my favorite spot in town. You've got the sea breeze, the windmills to watch, the sound of singing birds... Yep, this is the spot.
It's a beautiful place. Thank you for bringing me here, Wornhardt.
I'm just glad you can appreciate it. I know it's not very private, but I always feel good when I'm here. It's the best sun spot in town!
I'm sorry, I didn't realize. I only wanted to share my favorite place with you.
Hey, good concern! I already put on some sunblock that Catherine makes. It should be no surprise that I burn very easily.
Let me know if you need some!
I really was hoping for more privacy.
Aren't you worried about sunburns?
Actually, the real reason I like this spot is because it's so easy to focus on my thoughts. Jun mentioned once that this is a kind of meditation. Mindfulness, I think.
I'm not an expert in mental health, but I think the idea is to just focus on being present, in the moment.
That sounds peaceful.
Not only that, but I think it's helped me clear some things up in my head. Just a little personal baggage.
Yeah, me too. It's good for me to get out of the hospital sometimes. Just changing your environment can really improve your mood, you know.
Maybe you're not giving them <i>enough</i> credit!
I'm glad you found this spot.
You're giving a lot of credit to these windmills.
I hope you think of this place if you're ever struggling with anything. You know, emotionally.
Talking to people is great, but sometimes sitting with your thoughts is more helpful.
You're completely right.
I'm sure I'll use this spot sometime.
So now that we've been here a little while, tell me something - what do you feel, right now?
You're uncomfortable here? I'm sorry, I've never felt that way. We can go soon, if you want.
It sure sounds like you're in the present moment! When it comes time to relax, you just can't beat salty breezes from the sea.
I feel too hot in the sun.
I feel the salty wind from the sea.
Thank you for coming here with me. I like to share my peaceful places with the people I care about, whether or not they feel the same way.
Oh, I suppose it's about time to go. I have some files to sort through at the hospital. This was great, XX.
Yeah, it was. I can't wait to see you again soon, XX. Bye for now!
No no, thank you! I can't wait to see you again soon, XX. Bye for now!
This was fun!
Thank you for taking me someplace meaningful, Wornhardt.
It's a bit strange having someone else in my house. What do you think?
Looking around, I have to ask. How did you make so much money?
I think that would usually be a rude question to ask. But honestly, I don't care.
I inherited a lot of money from my grandparents. My family's wealth goes back generations.
I wouldn't call myself classy. But thanks anyway.
I hope that's not a problem for you. Anyway, it isn't like I asked for an inheritance.
That explains why you're so classy.
So you didn't work for your wealth?
XX, you're the only person that has seen this part of my life other than my family. I've had a question on my mind for some time and you're the only one I can ask.
All of this stuff... the mansion, the furniture... would you want all of this? For yourself?
What makes you ask a question like that?
I grew up in this place so I'm comfortable here, but I'm used to it all. None of it is impressive to me anymore. I'm wondering if other people see value in it that I don't.
Oh, my goodness... XX, nobody is as kind to me as you!
Ah, so that's what people think... I guess I'm glad to know the truth.
The only thing I'm impressed with here is you.
You might be taking things for granted, Claude.
Thank you for humoring my stupid questions, XX. I don't get many chances to ask them.
I won't ask you any more dumb questions, I promise.
Your questions aren't dumb, Claude.
Feel free to ask me anything, whenever you want.
There you go, being nice again. Sometimes I wonder what I would be like if I had a life like yours, XX.
Grounded, huh? I'll add that to my list of flaws, thanks.
Heh, I'd like to think so too.
You might have become a little more grounded.
I'm sure you'd be just as brilliant.
Well, it's getting late and I have work to do.
This was not bad, XX. Maybe we can even do it again sometime.
All right. Goodbye, XX.
That sounds all right to me. Goodbye, XX.
I'll see you later, Claude.
I promise we'll do this again!
This is so fun! I think you know, but I haven't been on a real actual date before. I'm glad it's with you, XX!
I'm shocked you haven't been on any dates before me!
Weeeell, there was one time I accidentally locked Liam in the pet store with me, but that was on accident and Lucia said it didn't count as a date, nyan.
I still thought it was fun...
I did! Liam is a funny funny guy. He's so shy though! I was talking the whooole time but he barely said a thing.
That doesn't sound like a good time.
I bet you still had fun!
Oh! XX, tell me what you think of my dress! I made it myself, nya. It's like what I used to wear when I worked at the carnival!
My good good friend Arianella taught me how to sew. She's the very very best seamstress in the world, I think!
You worked at a carnival?
Yeah yeah! You didn't know? I used to walk on a rope way way up high. It was easy! Plus I made lots of money, nya. It's how I bought the pet store.
Can you believe Kitty was the star of the show??
Ah, thank you XX! It was a big big show, too. I wish I could still perform like I used to, but there are no carnivals in Sun Haven. So instead, Kitty wears her performance clothes every day!
What, XX doesn't think Kitty can be a big star?
It was a big big show, thanks very much! I'm a very very good performer.
I can totally see that!
It must have been a small show, huh?
It's been a looooooong long time since I've had a friend like you XX. It's fun to chat!
You don't chat with people in Sun Haven?
Who was your last good friend?
The last time I had someone to talk to this much, Kitty was only twelve. My best friend Mina, she was an Angel. Nobody has been as good friends with me as she was.
When the Withergate rumors started and business got so so slow here, her family moved away west. Sometimes we send letters, but it's not the same as having a friend to play with right in town, nyan.
I don't like thinking that way, nyan. I want to hold on, even if they're halfway around the world.
You're a real, true friend. It's almost like having Mina back home!
Sometimes we have to let go of friends.
Well, now I'm here with you.
Uh oh, time passes so fast. I need to go feed the animals their lunch!
XX, thank you again for taking me on this date. You're super super sweet, nya!
Ah!! You're too nice! Thanks again, lots and lots. I'll see you soon, nya!
I'll see you soon, nya!
Not as sweet as you, Kitty!
I'll see you later!
I don't know when I last spent any time away from the bakery AND the girls. Hopefully they aren't giving Jun too much trouble.
It feels like all my time is taken up by my responsibilities these days.
Do you get to see anyone outside of the bakery?
Sure, I get to spend time with Pod's mom Kara on playdates. My sisters love running around the yard with little Pod.
Kara's great, too. Talking to her is easy, even if I still stumble over my words. And she makes some great cookies!
Heh, I guess so. They might even be good enough to sell in my shop!
But the main thing is, Kara understands what it's like to be a single parent. I guess we kind of relate to each other that way.
Oh, what? Is that what you really think? I mean, I guess I've seen him pull some tricks before, but he seems innocent enough.
Maybe you just haven't spent enough time around him, XX.
It's about time someone made YOU cookies!
That Pod is a bad influence.
You know what's weird? At least, something I think is kind of weird?
When other people bake me things, I get really excited. I mean, really really excited. Like I used to when I first started baking.
What about when you bake alone?
Eh... I guess I don't get that excited about it anymore. I love tasting other people's recipes, but I know all of mine. Maybe I'm just bored baking the same things every day.
Hm, that's a good way of looking at it, actually. I guess it's nice knowing that I still care about it at all.
That might be true... Do you think I'm going to hate it one day? Oh, I hope not.
At least you still get passionate about it, one way or another.
It sounds like you don't like baking as much as you used to.
You know, when I first moved here with the girls and opened the bakery I was really excited about having my own bakery. Like, really really excited about it.
I wonder what changed...
Your passion turned into your job.
You were forced to work far too much.
Hm. Wow, actually. Yeah. I get what you're saying. XX, if I never opened a bakery then I would probably still like it just as much as I used to.
You're right, XX. Maybe that will bring me out of this funk I've been in.
But if I did that, I would go broke. No offense XX, but that's just really bad advice.
You should bake for yourself more often.
You should stop baking altogether.
You know, talking to you out here was really helpful. Thanks XX. You might be the best friend I have in town.
I need to get back home before the girls beat me there. But this was great, XX!
Okay... bye!
Oh! Yeah, next time!
Okay, see you!
I can't wait for next time!
I'm glad you had the guts to ask me on a second date, XX. Turns out, I have a really good time with you!
You're staring. Is there something on your mind?
Huh? Wow, you really are getting to know me, XX. Yeah, something has been rattling around my brain all week.
Actually XX, I don't think I mind you prying into my business anymore. I'd say we're close enough by now.
Ugh... okay, but you have to calm down first.
Tell me if you want - I've learned not to pry by now.
Tell me, tell me!
I've been thinking about something my mentor told me when I was a kid. His first lesson to me. He said, "Don't count on any one person but yourself."
I used to take that to heart, but lately I've been questioning it.
What made you start thinking about this?
I can't really say. Maybe it's my business, the people in town, or even you.
A lot has happened since you moved here. It's hard to look at all the changes in Sun Haven and not think about my own life.
Come on, XX. It's obvious we have a connection. Don't tell me you're still playing dumb! We're way past flirting now.
For one, I think my old mentor was an angry, lonely person. I didn't see it like that though, not at the time. I thought he was a survivor like me. On the same team, you know?
Wait, you said even me?
Have you come to any conclusions?
I guess it all comes down to old habits. As a kid, I was living alone on the street until I met this grifter - my old mentor. Yes, he was a con man. But he helped me.
He gave me food and clothes. He even taught me how to make money on my own. His advice kept me alive. Heck, I still use what he taught me every day at the shop.
In the end, he took all the money we made together and disappeared. Never even told me his name.
I was able to get by just fine, but I always worked alone after that.
I can't believe someone would do that to a kid.
You're lucky you got away from that creep.
Well, he did teach me what I needed to know to make a living. Tricks to trading, how to make profit, how to make connections. I even learned a grift or two - but I don't do that anymore.
Really, I'm thankful he took me under his dirty little wing. Look at me now!
Yeah, I know. I mean, thanks XX, but I already know that I'm the definition of success. I guess I wanted you to know, too.
What's that supposed to mean? You mean I seem like a street urchin, or a fraud? You know what, don't bother explaining.
You're a real survivor, Anne.
This explains a lot about you.
Listen, I haven't told that story to anybody before. Do you get that? XX, I'm trying to tell you that I trust you.
I want to be your girlfriend, XX! And if you didn't see that coming by now, then you're really hopeless.
So, what do you say?
What? Really, you're turning me down?? Wow...
I'm the full package, XX. If you can't appreciate that, then it's good you turned me down.
I think we're done here. You should go. I'll see you around, XX.
I knew you'd say yes! I mean, how could you say no?
Oh, shoot it's late! I'm sorry XX, but I need to prepare for tomorrow. But hey - I'm really glad we did this. I'll see you, XX!
I don't think so, Anne.
Absolutely!
Thanks for coming, XX. I just wanted to keep it simple today, so I hope this is all right.
This is fine by me, Nathaniel.
Okay, great. My mom always told me to try and impress my dates, but I just don't have the energy for that these days. It has nothing to do with you though!
Heh, sorry XX. I've been thinking a lot about my future in the army lately, and that always leads to thoughts about my mom. I think I mentioned it before - she's the colonel.
Is it not? Well I'm not very interested in the "game" of dating, anyway. I just want to be myself. If that's a problem, then maybe this won't work out.
It's cute that you still take advice from your mom.
Taking dating advice from your mom isn't the best idea.
Anyway, I've always thought I would follow in her footsteps precisely. But now I'm beginning to wonder if that's the right path for me or if I just feel like I owe it to her.
Why would you owe it to her?
Oh that's right, I haven't talked about this with you yet.
XX, you know I'm an army baby raised by my mom alone. But I never told you that she adopted me after I was left on her doorstep as an infant.
It's okay - I've had a very good life because of it.
... It's cute how much you care, though!
I don't know if being abandoned ever really "works out," XX.
I'm sorry that happened to you.
It sounds like it worked out for you.
Sometimes I wonder what my life might have been like if I wasn't abandoned. But when I start to think like that, I just take a look at where I ended up and stop worrying.
So you plan to stay in the army?
But now you're having doubts about the army?
Thing is, I just don't know. It's been on my mind for a while now. Then you came to town and showed me what happens when somebody has a completely fresh start.
I have to say, you make it look like a good option, XX
The whole point is that I need to figure out what <i>I</i> want to do, XX. I don't need to be told what to do anymore.
I think you're right. Even if it takes another five years, I know I can figure this out.
You should quit the army and start fresh, like me.
I know you'll figure out what to do in time, Nathaniel.
Nobody listens to me the way you do. People think I've got it all figured out because I'm Captain, but I don't feel that expectation with you.
When I do figure out what path I want to take for myself, I want you there with me. XX, I'm saying that I want us to be a couple. Do you want that, too?
Oh. I see. Okay. We'll stay friends, I guess.
XX, it's getting late. I should hit the hay. This was a nice time, though. Thanks for coming by.
Thank goodness! I tried hard to look stoic, but my heart was beating so hard I thought it would dent my armor!
XX, this has been a lovely night. I've never felt closer with someone. But, it is getting a bit late.
Let's call it a night. Thanks again, XX. I'll see you soon!
I don't want that, Nathaniel.
That's exactly what I want, Nathaniel!
I hope you don't mind all the plants. I love sharing my space with these beautiful leaves!
Your home is beautiful, Catherine.
You think so? Thanks! It takes a lot of upkeep keeping the place clean. I had to cast magic charms on each plant to keep bugs away. And then there's the dirt...
I did... You don't think it's enough?
Oh, thanks XX! I'll admit, I was buzzing around like a bee preparing for tonight. I'm glad it worked out.
I can see you made an effort.
You've done a great job keeping the place together. It's impressive!
While I was getting the place ready for you, I was thinking a lot about my family.
Having somebody else to clean for reminded me of my dad and mom, how they could barely keep up with the house chores while us kids ran around all over the place.
Do you miss those days? Being a kid?
I don't know if I miss those days as much as the feeling I had back then. You know, the feeling of having a complete home. A big family, meals at the dinner table... That kind of stuff.
I don't know how to explain such a far-off feeling if you don't already know what I'm talking about.
I'm glad you know what I'm talking about. It's really hard to describe such a far-off feeling!
I don't really understand.
I understand exactly what you mean. I've been missing that too.
To be perfectly honest, sometimes I worry that I won't be able to make my home feel whole in that same way. You know, for my own kids.
I just want a perfect home for my family.
I get it - I want the same thing.
It makes sense you feel this way. I wouldn't let it worry you too much.
Oh sheesh, I've been blabbering on and on! I didn't mean to completely hijack the conversation.
Well that's a good thing. I can be quite the talker, sometimes. Maybe we really are good for each other, XX.
I know that, XX - that's what I'm apologizing for. Anyway, thanks for making me feel worse about it.
I don't mind! I love hearing you talk.
You're pretty good at that!
So, XX... what do you think? I had a great time with you, again. I really like you. Are we a match?
I would love to be your partner, XX!
It's getting a little late, and I want to end on a good note. Let's call it a night!
Wow, I completely missed the mark on this one. Sorry, you're right. Let's just be friends.
It's getting late now, XX. Let's call it a night.
We're definitely a match! Catherine, let's be together!
I don't think so, Catherine. We're good friends, but that's it.
Thanks for inviting me, XX. I was surprised when you asked, but it's nice to get my head out of the forge once in a while.
Wait, why were you surprised?
Oh, I don't know. I guess it just seems like you could have more fun spending time with someone else, like Lucia or Nathaniel.
Aw, really? Maybe I'm just thinking about it too much.
I like spending time with you too, XX.
Oh... Is that the only reason you invited me out? You know what, nevermind.
They're great, but I want to spend time with you, Lynn.
I just invited you because I was bored.
I'm really glad you moved here at the same time as me. This way, it's less like I'm the outsider trying to fit in.
It almost feels like we're in this together... Oh, but I don't mean "together" together! Not like that!
Um, anyway...
So how is your farm?
I've been hard at work on the farm.
I bet you have! I see you running around town all the time. You do seem quite busy.
I know the feeling. My body aches all the time from blacksmithing, but I love thinking that I'm constantly improving.
I understand that feeling, but you can't give in to it. Once you lose your morale, the work will suffer. That's something Solon has said before.
It feels good to work hard.
I'm tired all the time.
You know, you're fitting in really easily here. XX, can I ask you something? It's kind of serious, so please don't tease me.
Go ahead.
What is it?
Do... do you think I should have moved here to be an apprentice?
I think I'm a good blacksmith, but I wonder what would have happened if Solon had chosen someone else.
Maybe someone else would do a better job than me. Solon is a master, after all. He could apprentice anyone in the world.
I just don't feel like I deserve to be here. Am I thinking about it too much, or did I really make a mistake?
Sheesh... I never thought of that before. You might be right. I have a lot of thinking to do.
You mean it, and you're not teasing? Okay... I think I really needed to hear that.
Thank you XX, you're a great friend.
If you were meant to be here, would you be doubting yourself?
You deserve to be here more than anyone.
I still have some work to finish today, so I should be getting back now. Are you ready to go?
This was fun, XX. Thanks for taking me out!
Oh my goodness, me too!
This was fun, XX. Thanks for taking me out. I'll see you!
Sounds good.
I wish we could stay all day.
I love this bridge. It's an architectural marvel, really. Without it, Sun Haven would be completely doomed with no way for merchants to enter the city.
Sorry, am I talking too much about the bridge?
It's okay, I don't mind.
No, I don't want to bore you. Let's talk about something interesting, like... crossbows?
Oh, you're just being nice! You can tell me if I'm ruining the date already. Besides, I've never been a fan of crossbows.
You're right, crossbows stink. Sorry XX. I'm already ruining this date, huh?
Crossbows... are great!
Crossbows? Really?
I haven't been in any kind of romance in many years, so I'm just a little rusty. Why don't you take the lead for me?
All right, what would you do if you found a pile of gold in the forest?
That's easy, I'd secure the gold and find the rightful owner.
Hold on, that's a boring answer huh? Let me think of something better...
I've got it! I would buy a boat. Sailing the seas sounds like such an adventure, I can't even imagine what it's like.
Oh? Well if you don't mind, I'll be the judge of what's "me."
You mean that? It was what I wanted to do when I was a young boy. Before the military became my priority.
I don't think sailing is very "you."
You know, I can definitely see you as a sailor!
It's funny, I completely forgot about that until just now. I haven't thought about sailing in many years. Maybe you have a way of getting through to me, XX.
Would you leave the military to be a sailor?
Do you wish you had become a sailor instead of joining the military?
No, I don't think so. I'm good at this life, and I make a difference. I help people. At the end of the day, that's what most important to me. Besides, I can become a sailor after I retire from the military.
Maybe, but I don't think of it that way. It's my duty, and that's the end of it.
Not many people would be so selfless.
Maybe your principles are holding you back.
Oh darn, time always slips by when I don't want it to. XX, I have to be going now. This was a fun date!
Bye for now!
Already making plans? Hah, I love it!
I'll see you soon, XX. Bye for now!
Okay, goodbye Nathaniel.
I can't wait for the next one!
Don't make fun, but I've been thinking about a second date ever since the first one ended!
So you must really like spending time with me, huh?
Oh, XX! Come on, don't start teasing me now.
But, you're not wrong. Just so you know!
I feel like if we stick together, maybe we could have fun forever.
Oh - I'm sorry! I hope that wasn't weird to say.
Okay okay, you don't have to gloat like you won a competition or something.
I always have a good time around you.
Hah! I knew it.
When I think back to the last time I really had fun - really good fun - it was way back before I left my home village. It feels like a whole lifetime has passed by since then.
What was it, the fun you had?
Oh! This might not sound fun to you since you're not a blacksmith by trade, but it was in a competition at the seasonal smithing festival.
It's not a very serious competition, mostly for fun and to show your skills. But I'm proud to say that I smithed a full set of armor in a single day!
Well, it wasn't exactly the prettiest set of armor. It was very rough, actually.
Do you really think I'd lie about something so silly? Give me some credit, XX. I'm no liar.
That's incredible!
No way - you must have had help.
Now that I think about it, it was that competition that brought me here. I remember, a man stood and watched me work all day long. And it took all day, too.
It was Solon! He approached my mother and me after I won the competition and introduced himself. Of course, we recognized his name.
Then he said he wanted to teach me and... now I'm here. That truly may have been the best day of my whole life.
You've come so far, Lynn.
You deserve all of your success.
XX, can I be serious for a moment? I haven't felt this close with anyone before. I mean, not like I feel with you.
There's something I want to ask you, but I might be too scared to ask...
Oh thank goodness! Oops sorry, I mean yes! I want that too, XX, very badly.
Oh, okay. Maybe it will come up next time.
Lynn, I want you to be my girlfriend.
If you say so.
It's getting a little late. How about we finish up before I say something silly and ruin it?
Oh, you just love making fun of me. Anyway, thank you for a wonderful night, XX.
XX... Tonight went better than I could have imagined.
Neither of us want that!
*Give Lynn a kiss*
This is where the prince of Withergate rests his head. What do you think?
Why is your crown hanging on the wall?
Oh, that... I choose not to wear it. I prefer the natural crown I was born with.
Thank you XX. I'm glad that I can trust you with my candid thoughts without fear of... teasing.
Don't you think I know who I am? Don't begin telling me what to do, XX.
You <i>were</i> born with beautiful horns.
That's silly - you're the prince!
The truth of the matter is - and, this is not easy for me to say - I'm not so sure... I deserve the crown.
Didn't you tell me it was time for Withergate to have a change in leadership?
I did, and I believe that to be true. I just don't know if I'm the one who should take up the mantle.
That means a lot coming from you. There's nobody whose opinion I value more than yours, XX.
I know who I am. There's no need to repeat redundant details like a parrot.
Nonsense, you're every bit of a ruler as your father - and more.
But you're Darius, the demon prince of Withergate!
I think it will take time, but for now I'm simply not ready to wear the crown.
Take all the time you need.
When the time is right, you'll know.
Thank you.
XX, I want you by my side. I mean, for good. Be with me and sit beside me when I eventually take the throne. You must accept my offer!
Your rejection... is unexpected. But I respect you nonetheless. Well, maybe a little less.
Of course you do! XX, we will be unstoppable together. Withergate will know an era of prosperity never known before!
I don't think so, Darius.
I happily accept, Darius!
It grows so late, so quickly. I have to bid you farewell, XX. Tonight has been unlike any other.
Then farewell XX, until I see you again.
I'll remember this night forever.
I had fun, too.
So what do you think of my place? Is it the standard for modern living or what?
Is this... a sewer?
Great observation!
I'm kidding, it's obviously a sewer.
Look, the rent is free and nobody can find me unless I want them to. So it really checks all of my boxes!
Wow, I was ready to have a full debate about the perks of living in the sewer. No really, I prepared arguments and everything!
I thought you might say that. This is <i>my</i> home, XX. I don't need you to like it, I just need me to like it.
If you like it, then I like it.
This place is disgusting.
I know what you're thinking - I'll have to settle down in a proper home one day, blah blah blah. Sure, but I plan to avoid that day for as long as possible.
What's wrong with settling down, anyway?
I don't know, it's so... normal? Nobody wants to live a normal life, right?
When I think of being old and crusty, I imagine myself remembering the good times, the adventures.
I want to be sure I have plenty to think about when I get gray around the muzzle.
Yeah? Maybe. At least I hope so, XX!
It doesn't feel like nothing to me, XX.
Maybe there are adventures in places you don't expect!
That's silly, you're worrying about nothing.
All right, since we're talking... I have a bit of a confession and I want to clear the air. I'm saying, no secrets between us!
Do you remember when I told you that I wear my dogtags as a joke, because it's funny? Well, it is funny... but that's not the whole story.
When I was a lot younger, barely more than a kid, I lived in a Human town in the north. And I sort of... accidentally set the town on fire.
It was an accident! And it wasn't even really my fault...
It kind of sounds like it was your fault.
All I did was scare a horse. Then it kicked over a lantern, starting a huge fire. I was blamed for it and run out of town. That stupid horse...
So, I had nowhere to go. But then some soldiers stopped to give me food on the side of the road. It was raining and everything - very sad, boo hoo.
They took me with them and I became an army grunt for a couple years, but... Let's just say I didn't quite fit the army lifestyle.
I realized I had no freedom of my own and was only made to follow orders. So guess what? I ran off!
Well, that's pretty much it. I used to be a little soldier boy, marching home each day.
You totally missed the point, XX. That's what I get for trying to explain myself.
Yeah, I guess I eventually figured that out. I just don't like the image it gives me. I don't want people to think of me as a soldier boy. Oh, or as a firestarter.
So you deserted the military?
You didn't have to keep that a secret from me, Donovan.
I only keep the dog tags as a reminder of my freedom. I haven't admitted that to a lot of people, you know.
Like I said, between us I want no secrets. We can't have secrets if we're going to be a couple!
Haha - the look on your face! Come on, you know we should have gotten together by now. So, what do you say?
I knew you'd say yes!
I won't lie XX, I've been talking way too much and it's been exhausting... Let's call it a day, yeah? But I'll see you soon!
Wow, blindsided! Hey, no worries XX. I get it, you don't want to be tied down. I can relate.
Hey, how about we call it a day? I'll catch you later, XX.
I would love to be your partner!
I don't think that's a good idea.
This might not be the coolest spot in Withergate, but it's one of my favorites. You can really <i>feel</i> the city here, you know what I mean?
So what's the coolest spot in town, then?
If you're asking me, I would say the club. It's so hard to get into, though. I've only seen the inside once when I decided to sneak in.
Well, that makes no sense. There's people, music, and food. Those are all the ingredients for a good time!
You've got the right idea, XX. Look at us now, all we're doing is sitting around. And I don't know about you, but I'm already having a good time!
I don't like going to clubs.
I don't need a club to have fun.
So tell me XX, because I need to know - aren't you bored in that Human town?
Sun Haven is a lot different from Withergate, but it's nice.
It's the farthest thing from Withergate, based on what I've seen.
Hey, is it true you have a beach? We should throw a monster beach party!
It's been a while since I saw a beach with sunshine on it. I used to love running around and digging in the sand as a pup!
Oh right, I forgot the Humans blame Withergate for all their problems. Maybe one day monsterfolk will be allowed to walk around Sun Haven.
Until then, it's not like we're missing much!
That sounds like fun!
I don't think that would go well with my neighbors.
It's weirdly easy talking to you, XX. I don't just sit and chat too much, you know. I usually lose interest.
There must be something special about you!
So... am I the coolest person you know?
Aw, you think I'm special??
Well you're definitely one of the most fun people I've met here. Good thing too, because this place was getting a little stale.
I'd rather have high standards than a mediocre life, XX.
That's a solid point. I never noticed how smart you are, XX.
Uh, I meant that like a good thing.
It sounds like you have impossible standards.
Maybe it has less to do with the place than the people.
Oh shoot, I didn't realize how much time has passed. Sorry XX, I need to cut our date short. I have a meeting with one of the haberdasher's heads. I better get going!
Huh? Oh man, did I say date? I was hoping you would say it first.
Well, whatever. I don't mind it. Thanks for a fun date, XX! I'll see you.
Thanks for a fun date, XX! I'll see you.
Oh, so this was a real date?
Okay then, see you later!
XX, I must admit this is an unusual situation for me. I have been on very few romantic dates in my time, believe it or not. There simply aren't many people that can match me.
I consider myself lucky to have found someone of value, like yourself, to spend time with.
I'm the one who's lucky, my prince. I'm honored to be your guest.
You're more than my guest, XX. You're my companion. Having you atop the castle with me, with all of Withergate sprawled before us... I feel invincible.
I'm intoxicated by the feeling. I never thought Withergate would grow to this scale... I also never thought I would be seen on a date with a farmer.
Of course I know that. Do you think me a fool, truly?
You might as well be invincible here.
Nobody is invincible, not even you.
Well XX, you have me here all to yourself - a position few people have ever found themselves in. Isn't there anything you'd like to know?
How do you feel about your father, honestly?
Ah... I should have known you wouldn't hold back. I appreciate that about you.
My relationship with my father is... complex. He has done wonderful work getting Withergate up and running. Although... He no longer feels necessary.
Father enjoys the city, but has no mind to expand it. If you're asking me, I say it's time for a change of leadership so Withergate can grow even larger.
You asked for my honesty and you dare reprimand me for giving it? It's not your place to correct me or counsel my feelings, XX.
I was always told that my ambition was my strongest trait. I can even see Withergate, with lights stretching into the dark horizon...
Isn't it disrespectful to talk about replacing your father?
That ambition will guide you to your future success.
Whatever happens in the future with Withergate or with me, I'd like to think I'll have people I can trust by my side. People like Xyla and Cordelia, but you most of all, XX.
I feel the same about you, Darius.
I don't deserve such praise from you, my prince.
My family has seen the rise and fall of many rulers in our time. Angels, Elves, Humans... history is littered with those who seize power only to lose it.
XX, I see a promising future for us. If we're lucky, tonight will be the the first step on the road to a powerful union.
Luck has nothing to do with it. When you're royalty, you make your own luck.
Then you're more of a fool than I realized. Power is all there is, XX. Without it, we are no different from the rats in the sewers.
I'd be lucky to share a future with you.
I have no real interest in gaining power.
Unfortunately, I must end our engagement here as I have a prior commitment.
Thank you, XX. This was the most fun I've had in a long while.
Goodnight, XX.
Yes, heheh... until next time!
Until next time!
I hope you don't mind that we aren't going anywhere special.
What do you mean?
I was worried you would think it's a boring date idea, just talking outside of my house. But this is my favorite spot in town, and I wanted to spend time with you here.
So you think that would be more fun? I'm sorry, I hope you're not bored with me.
I don't want to come off too strong, but that means a whole lot to me, XX!
Maybe next time we can go to the tavern.
If this is your favorite place, then it is special.
Now that I have some real time alone with you, I want to take this opportunity to get to know you even better.
What do you want to know?
Are you starting to feel like you belong here in Sun Haven?
I'm hopeful that you'll stick around, we need lovely people like you. I'm excited to see you blossom here, XX.
Ah, I guess I expected you to have made a connection to Sun Haven by now.
I feel like I belong more every day.
I don't know if I feel like I belong anywhere, really.
Let me ask you something, XX. When you first moved here, what were you looking for?
A new opportunity.
A community to call my own.
I see, so the Great City wasn't able to provide that for you? Actually, I'm not surprised. Big cities aren't always so hospitable.
If you need any help while you're here XX, I'll gladly lend a hand.
I understand, but I offered. Please, don't hesitate to find me for anything you need.
Oh, good. It makes me happy to help out when I can. Sometimes people feel guilty for accepting help, but there's something to be said for humbling yourself to others.
I don't want to seem like I'm taking advantage.
You'll be the first person I find if I need anything.
Oh my - is it really so late already? XX, I'm sorry but I need to get going. I have a session with Liam to prepare for.
I'm so grateful for today, XX. Thank you for a wonderful time! Hopefully we can do it again soon.
No problem, this was fun!
I wish we could stay, but I understand.
I hope you like my home, XX! Some people tell me it's too pink, but I say there's no such thing.
So, is pink your favorite color?
It has been since I was a kitten, yep yep! Do you think it's childish?
Some people say that I'm too much like a little kid.
You think so, nya? Thank goodness!
Calvin says I act funny. But I think Calvin is boring, so I don't care too much.
But that's just fun! How come people don't like to have fun??
That's ridiculous! Who said that?
Maybe you are a little... energetic.
Being honest, sometimes Kitty feels different from everyone. Sun Haven is my home but I don't think anyone understands Kitty anymore.
Oh, but people are nice too, nya! I don't want to sound like everyone is mean to me. Lucia makes me feel at home, nya. And Jun gives Kitty advice too.
But you still don't feel like you belong here?
That's not quite quite right. I know Kitty belongs in Sun Haven. But people don't listen to Kitty, or take her very seriously all the time. I deal with it okay, but it makes me sad sometimes.
I know that's true. But you make me real real happy, XX!
I wish it wasn't... nyan...
We all get sad, but that's okay.
Sometimes you get sad, that's just life.
I want to spend a lot more time with you, XX. That would make me very very happy indeed. You understand Kitty like nobody else does!
I want to spend more time with you, too.
You're easy to understand, Kitty.
I don't want to scare you away, XX, but I just have to ask... Can we be together? Like a couple-couple?
Oh nyan... I thought this might happen. Don't worry XX, I won't ask anymore. I'm glad to still be friends.
Oh, nya!! Really really?? I was worried you wouldn't want to be a couple, or maybe even friends since I asked - but I'm super super glad I did!
I'm sorry Kitty, let's just be friends.
I'd love to be a couple-couple!
XX, thank you thank you for being my best friend in Sun Haven. Just talking like this is very very nice!
Oh, but I need to bathe my cats soon. Do you mind if we end here?
Okay XX, goodnight!
Me too XX, a whooooole lot. I'll see you very very soon! Goodnight!
That's fine, I'll see you soon Kitty.
Tonight meant a lot to me, Kitty.
Thanks for coming to my house, XX - privacy can be a pleasant luxury, sometimes. I trust my home is comfortable enough for you?
Your house is beautiful!
Oh, thank goodness. I thought you might not like it.
Why thank you, XX. I do put effort into my home decor. Few people have seen inside my home, so I'm happy that you approve.
I was worried about that... Perhaps that's what happens when you don't have regular houseguests.
Nonsense, you have wonderful taste.
It is a little stuffy.
XX, I invited you into my house because you're one of the few people in town around whom I can relax. Truly relax, I mean.
My work forces me to be a perfectionist and I'll always be somewhat worried about proving myself. But around you, I don't think about any of those things. It's refreshing.
It must be exhausting, trying for perfection.
Oh, yes indeed! But don't think for a moment that I'll ever give up working hard for my people.
I don't want to damage your confidence in me. I simply don't have many candid conversations like this.
Thank you for listening, XX. Open ears are increasingly rare in our world. Everybody is so busy all the time - myself included.
Appearing weak is the least of my worries. You of all people should know that.
You can talk to me about anything, Lucia.
If you complain too much, it could be taken for weakness.
If I may, I would like to be completely candid with you once more...
What about?
You never have to ask me, Lucia!
I've been thinking about it for some time now, and XX, I think we would make a great couple. You add a balance to my life that has me happier than I've been in months.
I want to be your girlfriend, XX!
I knew you felt the same way! There's a spark between us, XX. Now we can feed the flames.
I must have been reading into our friendship too much. I'm so sorry, XX. I won't bring this up again.
Yes, absolutely!
I don't feel the same way.
Oh shoot - I just looked at the clock and wished I hadn't... I'm afraid it's getting late, XX. I need to send you home.
XX, before you leave I want to tell you how special you've become to me. When I think about you I start smiling without realizing. Nobody has ever had that effect on me before!
Yes... goodbye XX.
I'll see you in town tomorrow, I'm sure. Stay warm tonight XX - I know I will!
No problem - see you later!
You mean a lot to me too, Lucia.
You're the first houseguest I've ever had, even back in the Northern Region. I hope you like the place.
The girls are in their room, "sleeping," which probably means playing with their toys or something. So, don't worry about making noise.
I'm surprised you haven't had more guests.
It's partly because the house is often messy. The girls leave their toys around... and I'm not the most organized person, either.
Well that's good to hear. You make things really easy, you know that?
Sure, I'll just make that a priority over taking care of the girls and the bakery and the wheat field and myself...
I really don't care about that.
You should really keep your house clean in case of company.
I wish I had a friend like you in the north. Life was pretty lonely up there. People aren't very friendly. Even Emma and Elizabeth had trouble making friends, and they're adorable!
Is that why you moved here?
Oh... well, no. I guess I don't mind telling you what happened, but don't bring it up in front of the girls, okay? Promise? I need a promise, XX.
Your jokes aren't always funny, XX.
Okay, good.
I don't promise anything!
I promise!
We used to live in a big house in the north with our parents, but it was lost to a fire. Some kind of accident, but I never found out exactly how it started.
I got my sisters out safely, thank goodness. But... well, we were all the family we had left after that.
I'm sorry, Liam.
You're incredibly brave.
All I could do is focus on Emma and Elizabeth. But we just couldn't stay there, and we didn't have any close friends to rely on.
I was worried we would be homeless in the winter, so I took us south where it was warmer. Then we found Sun Haven.
Lucia and Jun cared for us. It was the nicest any stranger ever treated us, so we decided to stay.
Thanks, XX. Sometimes I think of how dangerous it was, traveling all that way with my sisters. But I'm glad I did.
I didn't have any other choice, XX. You have to understand that much, at least.
You did the right thing.
It was dangerous to travel with your sisters.
I haven't told that to anyone, other than Lucia and Jun after they took us in. XX, you're... great. I mean, I really value you. And being around you is nice.
Um, I'm trying to say that I would like to... be around you more.
Yeah, friends. Friends are good...
You know, it's getting pretty late. I should try to get the girls to sleep.
This meant a lot, XX. Thanks for coming over. I'll see you around, yeah?
Oh thank goodness you said it... I don't know if I ever would have gotten there.
Yes, XX - I really want that!
Tonight meant a whole lot to me, XX. Thank you for coming over and... being great. It's getting late though, and I need to put the girls to bed. I'll see you soon though!
I'm glad we're good friends, Liam.
Liam, do you just want to be my boyfriend?
So... this is my outside spot. I come here when I feel like I need some fresh air. I haven't been out here in a while, though. I've been so tied up with my work lately. And...
Is everything all right?
I want to tell you something, XX. I lied to you on our last date.
My house was not an inheritance. It's true that my family is wealthy, but I paid for the house myself.
I made quite a bit of money from my debut concerto. I wrote it when I was a teenager. It was a masterpiece.
I was, yes. But I don't know if that word still applies to me.
I shouldn't have lied about it, especially to you. It's... hard to explain.
That's incredible - you're a prodigy!
I don't know why you had to lie about that.
To put it simply, I haven't written anything as good as that first concerto since. It was my best work.
I guess I lied because it's easier if people judge me for my money. I don't want to be judged as a one-hit-wonder artist.
The only one judging you is you, Claude.
You don't think other people are judging me too? People look at me when I leave the house. I've seen them.
So... you think it's all just in my head? That's sort of a relief, actually.
Hm, I should have figured that people simply don't care about me.
They only want to know you better, like I do.
Nobody cares enough to judge you like that.
XX... why do you like me?
Because you have a beautiful soul.
Because you have a brilliant mind.
I was hoping you wouldn't say anything about my music or my money... and you didn't. You see me as more than those things.
XX... I think I want to be with you.
That's... devastating. But unsurprising. At least I saw it coming.
That's okay, I understand - wait, what?
I'm sorry, I was ready for a rejection. But you feel the same? XX... I never thought I would get here with you.
No, I don't feel the same way.
Yes, let's be a couple!
Today has been one of the best days I've had in years. It's all thanks to you, XX. I'd like to get back to work, but I want - no, <i>need</i> - you to know how much you've affected me. All for the best, of course.
Well... I said what I needed to. XX, I'd like to end this date before anything goes wrong. Is that okay?
Thank you, XX. I'll see you soon.
You were lovely, XX. I'll see you soon.
Of course.
Absolutely! This was lovely, Claude.
I'm curious to hear what you think about my house, XX. So, what do you think?
Your home is beautiful!
Oh good, I'm glad you like it! I think of my home as a reflection of myself. Everything in here was chosen very intentionally.
I have to stay attentive, all the time. It's part of my work as a teacher and counselor. Practicing thoughtfulness in my home is how I reinforce it in my everyday life.
Not one bit. Every action is done with purpose, XX, even if we don't realize it at the time. Practicing thoughtfulness in my home is how I reinforce it in my everyday life.
I love your attention to detail.
Don't you get tired of being so particular about everything?
I can tell that you try your best to be a helper. I do, too. Maybe that's what keeps drawing me back to you. You and I are the same, XX.
You really think we're the same?
I know it. Look how much you've already done to help this town. It seemed like we turned a corner the very first day you arrived, even. Frankly XX, I'm amazed by you.
I wouldn't be so sure! But thank you XX, it's nice to be noticed every now and again.
I suppose the one way we differ is in humbleness, heh.
You do more for this town than me, Jun.
I guess I am pretty amazing.
You know, one thing I've learned as a counselor is that people need passion in their lives. XX, what are you passionate about?
My relationships with people.
Making the best life for myself.
Ah, of course. That makes a lot of sense based on what I've seen from you. I just hope I get the chance to help you, somehow.
I get it. You need to grow independently, alone. I suppose I can respect that.
You've helped me grow, too. Every day I feel like a brand new person with you.
In this case, you really can't help me.
Jun, you already have helped.
XX, I don't want to seem too forward... but I think we should be together as a couple.
I know we're meant for each other. What do you say?
Oh... I'm sorry XX, I wasn't expecting rejection there. But if that's how you feel, well, that's just how it is.
It's getting late. We should call it a night. Thank you for the date, XX. I'll see you around.
I was so hoping you would say that! XX, this was a beautiful night. It couldn't have gone better. But it's getting late, and I have an early start tomorrow. Let's end on a good note.
Thank you for tonight. I'll see you soon, XX!
I don't think so, Jun.
That would be wonderful, Jun!
This will sound weird, but I'm not used to this kind of thing. Going on dates, I mean.
What made you want to go out this time?
You mean, why with you? Heh, I'm not totally sure.
Oh sheesh, I don't mean that the wrong way. I just mean that I usually turn people down when they ask me out. But there's something refreshing about you. You're like morning dew.
Anyway, this sure beats me locking myself away to work all the time.
On the contrary, I'm surrounded by life all day long. Life is the foundation of my work, XX!
You really put yourself out there, XX. That's something else refreshing about you!
You're missing out on life by locking yourself away.
You're special to me too, Iris.
Actually XX, this date means more to me than I'm letting on. Everybody in Nel'Vari is so familiar to me. I've been living with them for almost a hundred years now!
I think that's why it's exciting to be out with you. You're so different from everyone here.
Is it just because I'm not from Nel'Vari?
No, it's more than that. You think and speak differently than anyone I've met. I learn something new from you every time we talk, XX.
If you keep hanging out with me, I'm afraid that won't stop. It's the way of an enchantress, always learning through research or experiments. Better get used to it now!
I know that's true, but I can never bring myself to do it. I've seen Vaan go zipping out toward the Human town countless times, but there's something holding me back.
I've learned a lot from you too.
You could learn more by exploring ouside of Nel'Vari.
Even though I know it would expand my knowledge, the thought of adventuring out into the world makes my heart start pounding. Is that normal?
It sounds like you're afraid.
I don't think so...
Hm... Maybe it is some kind of fear.
I've never thought about this before, never had reason to. I'm content with my work here, but now you've got my brain working hard to figure this out!
Yep, and that's just the way it is. You're going to have to get used to that, XX.
But what interests me is why I'm scared. It doesn't make sense!
Unless you're saying it doesn't have to make sense? Ooh boy, now my mind is really going to fixate on this...
You think too much.
It's okay to be scared, Iris.
Well, you've given me plenty to think about tonight - I think that's just about all my brain can handle! How about we call it a day?
I had a good time, XX. I'll see you later!
Oh, quit being cute. I had a great time! I'll see you later.
Okay, this was nice.
For the record Iris, I think you're plenty brave.
So, this is my home! I made it with an engorging enchantment I developed. Did you notice it's a pumpkin?
I also grew the pumpkin!
This is incredible work!
I'm glad you like it! Nivara didn't bless me with magic for nothing. It's the least I can do for my people.
At the time, I didn't want it. Can you believe that? I felt like somebody else could have used it more. But now I'm glad she chose me. Obviously, I've put the magic to good use!
I guess not. But I'm very good at enchanting and it has led to some real improvements around town.
Nivara made a good choice blessing you.
Are you sure there isn't a better way to help your people?
In a way, having this magic set me apart from the others here. I mean, I'm grateful for it. I wouldn't trade it for anything in the world!
But I was always more advanced than my peers. I never made close friends with anyone because I was seen as competition.
I ended up spending a lot of time in Nivara's Sanctuary as a result, learning from her and honing my knowledge. Eventually, I identified with my magic more than with my neighbors.
That sounds a little lonely.
Kind of, but I treasure any time I get to spend with Nivara. And at least I can use my skills to help the town now. Even if nobody talks to me much, I know that what I'm doing is important.
That kind of petty behavior goes against everything I've learned from Nivara. You could stand to spend more time with her.
Actually, I don't see it that way. I'm blessed with the ability to help, so that's my responsibility.
You should stop working for them until they appreciate you.
You're the most selfless person I've met, Iris.
Without social distractions, I've made a lot of important discoveries. Life in Nel'Vari is thriving largely because of my work. So, I let go of any resentment a long time ago.
You deserve recognition from someone other than yourself.
To let go of those feelings is very mature.
It's funny... maybe it's because I've been sort of an outcast, but I almost don't even care about being welcomed by the other Elves.
But just now, hearing you say that made me realize that I care much more about what you think than what they think. XX, we've really become close since you showed up in Nel'Vari.
Thank goodness you understood! I thought everything I said would go right over your head.
Yes XX, I would love for us to be a couple!
That's not quite what I meant... but if that's how you feel, then I respect that.
Iris, I'd like you to be my girlfriend!
We will always be good friends.
It's getting a little late for me. There's always more work to do, you know. How about we call it a night?
Okay then XX, see you.
It really was. Thanks for being there for me, XX!
Sounds good, I'll see you later!
This was a magical night!
So, this is my home. You're welcome to make yourself as comfortable as possible.
Why did you choose to live inside of a tree?
Trees are a silent constant in our lives. I guess I feel a sort of kinship with them, maybe even more than with the other Elves here. Trees watch over us. Lately I've felt like I do the same.
No, no. Of course not. How to explain...
Of course. How to explain...
You feel like a tree?
I'm curious, care to explain more?
After my magic advanced enough to let me start flying, I saw things differently. Of course, literally from above. But in a more general way too.
More and more, I feel like an observer to the world.
Do you like being an observer?
Sure I do. Sometimes it's a lot to take in, though. The world can be a messy place, XX.
Heh, you're right too. It comes down to consistency. At least, that's how I've seen things recently.
People with that attitude always change their minds eventually.
You're right, but it can be pleasant too.
Only if you're not prepared for it.
The world simply lacks consistency. Things are always changing, and that causes more problems than it fixes.
I guess that's why I like living in this tree. It's also why I like you. You're a rare point of consistency, XX. I could sense it from you right away.
I never knew I had so much in common with trees.
Heh, how to explain... I feel like I can count on you, and know that you're being true to yourself. You don't put on any disguises or false fronts.
That's an increasingly rare quality, XX. That's also why I think we should be together, as partners.
Oh. Well XX, I must say that I'm disappointed. But I'm glad you're being honest with me.
It's a dream for me too, XX. With you, I'll fly higher than I could on any cloud.
I think we should only be friends, Vaan.
Vaan, that would be a dream come true!
With that, XX, it's time for me to say goodnight since I have an early start tomorrow. I'm glad we did this though, it means the world to me.
Oh now, don't pull at my heartstrings like that! Heheh, I'll see you soon, XX.
Yes, it's been a lovely evening. I'm glad you came.
Goodnight, XX. I'll see you again soon.
I think I miss you already!
Okay Vaan, this was fun.
This spot brings peace to my mind. In the shade of the Grand Tree, watching the fire crackle. It's easy to lose yourself here.
Do you have a hard time finding peace elsewhere?
Nel'Vari is peaceful enough. Look around, you can see it yourself.
I suppose I just mean that this is a nice, secluded spot to enjoy that peace.
I couldn't agree more. Spending time alone with myself is a big part of how I mastered wind magic.
Ah, I guess I don't blame you. I can't relate, though. People in general are fine, I just don't connect with many people.
Solitude is crucial to peace of mind.
I prefer to socialize with people.
It feels funny to say that I've "mastered" my magic. In a way, it's not the kind of thing you ever feel "done" with. I expect to continue learning more about it my whole life.
But you <i>are</i> a master?
I studied directly with Nivara. The last thing she taught me was how to maintain my spells sustainably so I don't run out of mana mid-flight.
After that, she had nothing else to teach me. So to answer your question, yes you may consider me a master.
Thank you, XX. I'm flattered just to know you're paying attention.
That's not what I meant at all, XX. Nivara is a wellspring of wisdom, her teachings will always guide my actions.
I've only reached the extent of her knowledge with wind magic, but there's always more to learn about life.
You must be incredibly talented.
So you think you know more than Nivara now?
It's important that the people in my life understand a connection with something larger than themselves, whether that's magic or something else.
XX, where do you find that kind of connection?
I find it in magic, too.
I find it in community.
Ah, of course. I could have known you would say that. I hope one day we can explore that kind of connection together.
Oh XX, sometimes you say exactly what I'm thinking. You're right, we must be linked already.
If you close yourself to possibilities before exploring them, then you've decided they are impossibilities.
I think we're already making that connection.
I don't know if that's something we can share.
I hate to say it, but I need to be going soon. This time with you was wonderful, XX.
Until the next time, XX. I hope to see you soon.
Yes, me too! Very much so. Goodbye for now XX, until the next time.
I had a good time.
I'm glad we got this chance to connect.
So, here we are. I remember you saying that there was more to you than I thought. I'm ready to find out now. Go ahead, impress me!
Impress you how?
Well, I don't know, sewer rat. Are you telling me there's nothing more to you? What I see is what I get?
Is that so? Well then I can't wait to dig deep!
It's not an act, outsider. Keep talking like that and you'll see firsthand.
You haven't even scratched the surface!
At least I don't have to act tough all the time.
Still, you are the first outsider from Sun Haven to have reached Withergate. That still amazes me, you know.
After the rumors started, we worked hard to make sure Withergate was near-impossible to reach from Sun Haven for our own safety.
Oh, it's boring to get into. Just that once the Humans started spreading rumors about Withergate, we realized that Sun Haven was a dangerous place for monsterfolk.
We cursed the forest with fog and left that nasty old dog to guard the boat. I never thought somebody would actually ask the dog for a ride!
It can't have been that clever if you figured it out.
Then again, you've shown that you're not completely useless. Maybe you're the kind of person we want to find Withergate after all.
Our defenses are perfect. Don't turn this into something ugly, outsider.
It was a really clever puzzle, though.
Your defenses are weak.
I guess, in a way, I'm glad you broke our defenses. It's been fun messing with you, at least!
And maybe I'm actually starting to like you. Maybe.
I'm just glad I got to meet you.
Look at that - you're being nice!
Okay, that's enough nice talk. Is everyone in Sun Haven like this? How do you stand it!?
I have some trouble, but only when the date is a complete flop - like with you.
Thank goodness... All those Humans in Sun Haven, no wonder they're so soft. Being nice is exhausting.
You're not very good at dating, are you?
Don't worry, we can go back to trading insults whenever you want.
Well sewer rat, it's getting late and I have work to do. Somehow, this wasn't all that bad!
Heh, I agree. Thanks for the fun, sewer rat. I'll see you around!
What are you, a child? This wasn't some playdate, you know!
Anyway, I'll see you around, sewer rat.
"Not all bad" sounds like the perfect night to me.
Okay Xyla - this was fun!
So? Aren't you going to compliment my apartment?
It's really nice.
Hah! Sure, okay. That didn't sound rehearsed at all!
Now you're just trying too hard, XX.
There's the sewer rat I know! Thanks from the bottom of my heart, truly.
No really, I love how it looks in here!
Fine then, your apartment stinks. Big time.
You know, these apartments are some of the nicest rooms in Withergate - outside of the castle, of course.
Would you want to live in the castle?
What, like a queen? Queen Xyla? Xyla, the Genius Demon Queen? Uh, no, no I've never even thought about it before.
You better hope I'm never queen, or you're going right into a dungeon.
All right, you've got me. Do I fantasize about it before I go to bed sometimes? Sure. Have I planned out exactly how to overthrow the Demon King and take his throne? Of course.
... Wait, what was the question?
You wouldn't be good at it, anyway.
Sure, it totally sounds like you've never even thought about it...
As fantastic as I would be as Withergate's queen... Queen Xyla... it's not really the job for me. The power is totally appealing, but the actual work is not really my speed.
I'm surprised you think so.
Don't you think you could do it?
It's not like I think I'd be <i>bad</i> at the job, but the everyday work is actually quite boring. A looot of paperwork.
Besides, trying to make a city of people happy doesn't sound like my kind of fun. My whole life I've been good at one thing, and that's making myself happy.
I think anyone that needs power to be happy is psychotic...
Don't get me wrong, power is a ton of fun! But there's a difference between having it and needing it.
If you think making yourself happy is a low bar, then I don't know what to tell you, sewer rat. You should talk to someone, I guess.
I agree, I don't need to be a ruler to make myself happy.
That's a pretty low bar.
Ew, I just realized that I've been a little too genuine with you tonight. I'm not usually like this with people, you know.
Hm... you know, I actually don't hate this. What do you say we make this official, XX? You want us to be a couple?
After all this, you don't want to be together? Wow outsider, I don't know what to say. I guess... Get out of my house? Yeah, that feels right. Get on out of here, sewer rat.
Okay, okay! You don't need to go crazy about it, heheh.
Well come here then, let's seal the deal. But I'm kicking you out right afterward, because it's getting late.
I do want that, Xyla!
Hey, you're actually on time! Personally I would have shown up a little late, but that's just because I'm fashionable. I thought we'd go to the tavern. Ready to go?
What, no flowers?
Eh, I don't really like flowers anyway. Ready to go inside, XX?
Good - Good morning XX! Oh gosh, my voice is shaky. Sorry, I'm a little bit nervous. But I'm still ready to go if you are!
XX, you're here! I don't know why, but I was nervous that you wouldn't show up. I'm really glad you did. Want to head inside?
Good evening, XX. I haven't been waiting long, so don't worry yourself about that. Shall we relax by the fire?
XX! I'm excited, it's been a while since I've gone out like this. Should we get a move on?
Everything is ready if you want to head in now!
Hey XX, I'm glad you made it! Are you ready to head out?
I'm ready to go in whenever you are.
Are you ready to get going, XX?
Are you ready to head inside?
XX, I'm glad you showed up. I don't know how long I would have stood here waiting!
Are you ready to go on our date?
Hi, XX. Ready to head inside?
Good evening, XX. Please, come inside!
Are you ready for our date, XX?
Let's go inside! Oh - if you're ready.
XX, you made it! I'm so glad.
Are you ready to go?
Thanks for coming, XX. Ready to head inside?
You came! I mean, I wasn't exactly sure if you still wanted to. I'm glad you did, though. Want to head inside?
XX, I'm relieved to see you. Join me here, won't you?
XX, you made it! Are you ready to go?
There might still be a little mess inside, but I'm ready if you are!
So you really want to spend time with me after all? Well, since you're here I guess you're ready to go.
Are you ready, XX? Let's head in.
Hey, farmer.
I was trying to say that like an insult. Did you pick up on that?
Anyway, are you ready to go?
There you are, nice of you to show up! Ready to go in?
