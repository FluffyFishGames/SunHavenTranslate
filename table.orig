I'm looking for a favor for my sister Emma - she just heard about <color=#39CCFF>iron ore</color> and is really curious... for some reason. She really just wants to see some. Can someone bring 5 <color=#39CCFF>iron ore</color>? You can deliver it straight to her, I bet that would make her happy. Thanks!

Dear XX,
Since you've been kind to me lately, I hoped I could trust you with a request. I'm looking for a new record, but the record store owner has been talking to me... a lot. I'd rather not see him today. Will you pick up a record and bring it to my home? I'm looking for something like a <b>waltz</b>. I've enclosed 500 gold to cover the cost. I'll pay you 500 gold for the delivery. Thanks in advance.

You're working hard, I can see it in your wallet - I'm kidding! But I can tell that you've been getting more confidence to you, which commendable. Now I don't do handouts but I can appreciate another small business owner. Consider this a loan. Pay me back by shopping at my store sometime.
- Anne
Hey XX,
Well, color me impressed! Not only am I invested in your farm's growth, but also in how well you invest your money back into the business. You're a skilled farmer and business owner! It's been a while since I've seen someone with your dedication and generosity, and I guess it struck a chord with me. Now is my time to be generous to you, just this once. It's my favorite, so don't waste it - Raspberry Cheesecake on a Diamond Platter.
To Farmer XX,
I'm Bernard, administrator at Sun Haven's Town Hall. I wanted to reach out with this housewarming gift as a representative of Sun Haven. I hope it helps you get settled on your new land.
Come visit me at Town Hall to the south of Sun Haven's town square if you would like to build a barn for livestock. I can also authorize renovations to your old cabin with a <color=#39CCFF>house upgrade kit</color>.
Regards,
Hello XX,
When I have Greenroot, I always find there is a hop in my step. Since you have been working so hard on your farm, I thought you could use that extra hop as well.
You simply must try it!
- Catherine
I was restocking at my shop and it seems I had a handful of extra Cinaberry Seeds. When I saw them, I knew they matched your red aura and were meant for you. Please enjoy them and continue to glow!
I want to welcome you to Sun Haven. Unlike even my most trusty bass, I have yet to find you out of tune. I'm curious what kind of song you will conduct in Sun Haven. You appear truly unique, but we will only know once we get to the bridge of your piece.
I do hope your farm is prosperous here. Perhaps I could even get to know you further.
I have traveled for years and heard songs from across the world that simply did not inspire me, but never has something spurred my creativity as much as yourself. From melody to chorus, you are entirely one of a kind.
Continue to play your song, I cannot wait to hear it.
Outsider,
I am not going to pursue you as Xyla would, but I do think you have much to prove if you wish to be a true part of Withergate. So take these and show me you have some value to my family's kingdom. I do demand a cut of your crop, so bring me a Kraken Kale as thanks for my generosity.
- Darius
I must admit, you are making waves in my court. Be careful not to undermine me or I will lock you in my dungeon for daring to act against the prince of Withergate without a second thought. I suppose, however, that you are finally earning some right to my presence and a place amongst my subjects, and dare I say, peers. You've earned my respect and for that, so I offer a single gift. Do not expect this to happen again.
Heyo XX,
Nice to get to stretch the old brain muscles and write a letter. Do you know how rare it is for me to do this? Mainly since Manhole #3 doesn't count as a valid return address. Lucky for me though, I could just borrow Darius's address. I'm sure they won't notice. Anyway! I was just coming up to get some grub and this guy just hands me a bone. Can you believe it! These suckers are like candy for an Amari like me. As much as I wanted to chew through it right away, I thought you might like it more. So give it a try!
- Donovan
Woof right, it's been a bit crazy since you came to Withergate. Your spice is exactly what this boring town needs, though. So thanks for that, making this place feel like home even though I am technically not supposed to be near the city right now due to... *ahem* circumstances.
Well XX, you did it! You got me liking human culture all over again. Jeez. Good thing you're cute or you would've gotten some real pushback.
I don't usually send mail outside of Nel'Vari, but I simply had to show you this remarkable basket of Blueberries I picked. I managed to get the tree to replenish in only a single hour!
P.S. You are allowed to eat it, please enjoy my work.
- Iris
Our conversations inspired me to take a moment's rest and work on this furniture piece that I'd put off for far too long. I like how it turned out, so I wanted to show you what your encouragement helped me create.
P.S. I included some of my babies along with it, water them well!
Dearest XX,
I was walking Topi and Pod home from school yesterday when my mind began to wander. I was so lost in thought, I wandered myself right into an apple tree! It was funny in the moment though, plus I ended up with a surplus of apples. Please, enjoy these apples!
- Jun
I find the best way to relax after a long and heart-filled session is to paint.
While working on this piece, I realized I was thinking of you. So, I want you to have this and remember to take a moment to appreciate the small things in life. Like a painting.

Hiya XX!
I saw the cuuutest plushie on my way from the pet store today. It looks JUST like you and I NEEDED to show you! Isn't it so cute, nya!?
- Kitty
You're always a very very nice person to me. You actually listen to me and hang out with me which is suuuper fun! So I wanted to get you something to say I was thinking of mew! Get it?? Teehee!
Hello there XX,
I was making some cookies to celebrate Elizabeth's school project (she got a SUPER! sticker), and I might have gone a little overboard. We had way too many and the shop was closed so I guess I thought hey, XX may like them.
So here’s a few treats, for you! I hope you like them!
P.S. You don't have to eat them if you don't like them.
Hi XX,
You have really helped me fully settle in here and you were supposed to be the new neighbor! So I thought, it was about time I bring you a housewarming gift. Except I couldn't find time to actually bring it to you, so I am sending it to you. I hope that is okay!
Thank you for being such a good friend and your support means a lot... and you know... Welcome to Sun Haven, I couldn't imagine the town without you!
I wanted to stop by to see how you were settling in, but I saw you were busy at work with a real fire in your eyes. Instead, I am writing you this letter to commend your hard work.
To thank you for your diligent work, I've included a small gift of Greenroot seeds. It may also be one of my favorites, I would not be opposed if you want to share!
- Lucia
You have continued to grow and change since coming to Sun Haven. To think you were also blessed by Elios makes us far closer to each other than anyone could imagine.
As a token of my admiration for someone as powerfully blessed as yourself, enjoy these mana tomes. I find they help me hone my mana just in time for training in the evening.
Hi there XX!
I know you're busy settling in still, but I noticed you were a little light on armor when you were headed to the forest. I was a bit worried about you, so I thought these would help get you started on some strong armor!
Stay Safe!
- Lynn
I saw your blade was looking a little dull, be sure to keep your sword sharp! I would be devastated to know a monster in the forest managed to hurt you because of a faulty weapon when I could have been there to help fix it!
Stay Sharp!
I heard about your skill from Roza as to how well you handle yourself in combat. You're very impressive with a sword, so I hear. So, you should come by the barracks sometime! I would enjoy the recruits seeing a true natural in action. Maybe I can offer a few pointers myself.
- Nathaniel
You missed joining in for a grand supper the last night, everyone in the barracks brought a dish! It was a true family-style potluck, one that I missed from when I was a rookie under my mother's command.
While you may not be a part of the guard, I do consider you a part of our family, XX. Join us next time! We would be glad to have you - if you bring a dish of your own of course!
Look here XX,
I was stocking up on odds and ends, and this shipment of records came in scratched. (That's what I get for buying in bulk!) Turns out this is my favorite song, so consider it a free sample for the wares I have at my store.
I was cooking dinner yesterday and I realized just how soothing this song was after stirring my cauldron all day. It is one of my favorites, so I hope it brings you a little peace as well.
In my days, I have spent much time alone working on music. Yet, I have only ever finished a single song that I liked. Though I dislike sharing it and have gone to great lengths to prevent those here from finding my records, you listened to my songs - unfinished or only barely started - with a smile. I feel like I can give this to you with the confidence you will enjoy it without judgment.
Human culture has always been lesser than that of the Demons. When we began the construction of Withergate City, musicians from across the land dared to present their music to my father and me. This is a recording of the best musicians to ever grace this world. Listen to it and perhaps you will begin to understand the true value of Withergate's culture.
I was sliding back down my ladder after helping this slime dude find his lost keys, and I had to pause - this great tune was playing on my record player! So in that moment I decided you need a copy. I mean, if I can jam out down in the sewers then you should be able to jam out wherever you want.
I spoke with Nivara today and she explained how much she much loved the tune of the birds. It was only then I realized how much I enjoy the music in my workshop and how it inspires me to work even harder. So I wish for you to have a copy of the song I like so much.
P.S. I hope it inspires your productivity on the farm.
I find meditating in the morning to be a good mindfulness practice. As I was enjoying my meditative trance, I found myself humming along to my music without thinking about it. You should give it a listen, I think you will enjoy the mellowing effect it has.
I so so LOVE this song and I needed you to hear it. So take a listen and fall in love with it, just like Kitty. It makes me wanna get up and shake my tail, nya!
Hi there XX,
During our session today, Jun reminded me that sometimes it's good to take a step back and relax. So I took today to listen to my favorite song. In a way, it was kind of stressful to take a whole day just to myself.
So you too. I mean you should too. Take a day... to listen to music you like.
I am going to sign this before I make it a complete disaster.
I was working late last night, finishing off a few of my Archmage duties which followed me home. I quite like to listen to music as I work, and I think you would as well. So please accept this gift, my favorite song to listen to. Perhaps it will be yours as well.
I wanted to thank you for spending so much time with me lately and making me feel welcome to Sun Haven. You may remember this song, I hum it when I tinker and I sing it when I walk, oh that is embarrassing to think about. I hope no one heard me on my walk...
Well, I really like the song and I want you to enjoy it as much as I do.
Enjoy!
Have you ever thought of battle like a dance? With every step and slash of your sword, you move in unison like making your own dance. The further you practice, the further you can perfect each movement.
So please, take this record. If you listen to it while you practice, it will be as though we are dancing together even when we are apart.
Taking to the air allows me to think and clear my head. It is a freeing experience I doubt you've had the honor of feeling just yet.
There is one thing that clears my head just as well though - this song, a true waltz in symphonic form. When the day comes where we dance in unison, this shall be our song. So learn it well, I would quite enjoy our dance to be perfect.
- Vaan
While I was looking over my next month of meetings and appointments, I found myself swaying to the music. This really is my favorite piece, I wish I knew who wrote it. Anywho, I asked around at the record store and they had a second-hand copy, too bad it was missing its sleeve as well. A shame, but now you can have one. Enjoy this song and sway along, like the trees in the wind, and lose yourself for a moment in the music!
- Dr. Wornhardt
Hey <s>Sewer Rat</s> XX,
I've yet to meet someone from the Human town that actually has some value to me, and that's still true. I will not allow you to bring your human nonsense into my town and mess up the place. So take whatever you were playing in your apartment and throw it out immediately. This is real music and I expect you to listen to it. Understood?!
- Xyla
To XX,
Since I fly over your farm on my way into Sun Haven, I've seen you do such interesting things. In Nel' Vari I see Iris, the Elven Enchantress, work with her plants.. but it's different from you. You tend your crops so gently, and with such care, instead. Truly, I'm delighted to see you care for nature, so with this letter I've included a gift that should help your work. Farewell.
Greetings my dear XX,
The more I explore, the more I find people who admire my abilities and admire me. Yet, you continue to only watch me with a smile. Knowing you has made me grateful for the time I spend more grounded. And while I cannot take you with me on my Nimbus Cloud, I wish you to have the same sense of being in the clouds as me. I used my own magic to make a bed this soft for you, so please enjoy it, my dear. I worked so hard that I nearly broke a sweat!
While an apple a day certainly does not keep the doctor away, a treat never hurt anyone now and again either. Make sure you are taking care of yourself and don't be afraid to stop by the hospital or my house for a check-up. I like to make sure everyone in Sun Haven is taken care of, especially if you are working hard in the sun. So come by any time!
You have been working so hard lately, I think you could really use a little time to lean back and watch the clouds. Just like our first date together. A lovely thing it was. So enjoy the clouds, the little things in life that we all wish we had more time for.
Hello Sewer Rat,
You've been such a pest, all of Withergate is talking about you sneaking into <i>my</i> city. Listen to me closely, I will PAY you to just stay out. So take the bribe, and stick to your cushy farm in Sun Haven. You got it?
Seems you're finally understanding the importance of all my work. The buildings, the layout, the shops, the carnival. All my work! When you were on your terrace the other night, I couldn't help but think about that. Wow, you weren't admiring me for once. Instead, you were admiring my craftsmanship, my work. In a way, that felt better than actually getting complimented. So take this, then you can admire my work at all times and compliment me about it later.
Oh great, you brought that <color=#39CCFF>seaweed</color> I wanted. Well, thanks. Oh right, here's your gold.[]I'm still not clear on how this works... do I eat it, or put it on my face?

Lookin' for <color=#39CCFF>peppers</color>!
I need 5 <color=#39CCFF>peppers</color> so I can trick Ronald with them. He's such a wimp with spicy food! Just bring 'em on by the tavern - but speak to me and not Ronald! I'll be payin' for your help, of course.

Mari's Trick Peppers
Hey, XX. Oh - you brought the <color=#39CCFF>mithril sword</color>! I was expecting Solon or Lynn, but you seem to know your way around an anvil![]Here's your payment, farmer. Thanks a lot for the help!
Bring Nathaniel a <color=#39CCFF>mithril sword</color> for advanced training. You can craft <color=#39CCFF>mithril swords</color> using mithril ore found in the mines.
Attention Sun Haven!
Nathaniel here! I'm in need of a high-quality sword for advanced training. What I'm after is a <color=#39CCFF>mithril sword</color>. The army will reimburse you generously for your work.
- Cpt. Nathaniel
Nathaniel's Equipment
Farmer, you're a lifesaver. I don't know what we would have done without these <color=#39CCFF>onions</color>.[]Did you think I'd forget your pay? Heh, not a chance!
The tavern is short on <color=#39CCFF>onions</color>. Bring 10 <color=#39CCFF>onions</color> to Ronald at the tavern.
HELP NEEDED!
Our usual suppliers missed a shipment, so now the tavern is short on <color=#39CCFF>onions</color>! We're paying top dollar for 10 <color=#39CCFF>onions</color> at the tavern. Please be quick!
- Ronald
Onions for Ronald
Wow, these really are heavy! Which means they should work perfectly. Thanks a bunch, farmer![]Here's your payment!
Peter needs a set of <color=#39CCFF>copper legs</color> to keep his footing. Make or buy a set of <color=#39CCFF>copper legs</color> for Peter. You can craft them at an anvil using copper ore from the mines.
Wanted: <color=#39CCFF>Copper Legs</color>
Yesterday, I was pulled right off my feet by a huge fish! Now I want a set of good, heavy <color=#39CCFF>copper legs</color> to keep my feet on the ground for round two. Anyone who has the skills to make them can deliver them straight to me. I'll pay!

Peter's Sealegs
Oh, thank you XX. I really needed this - my head is killing me. Here, take this as a thank you.
Pinto bumped his head and needs some pain relief. Find a <color=#39CCFF>water crystal</color> and bring it to him at the barracks.
Hello, this is my first time using this board. I'm looking for a <color=#39CCFF>water crystal</color>. Nobody at the barracks seems to have any. I hit my head this morning and have had a headache all day. Please return quickly with a <color=#39CCFF>water crystal</color>.
- Pinto
Pinto's Headache
Is this is for that poster I put on the bulletin board? Neat! I'm going to use these to make some cool armor. Then maybe I can impress Allison.[]Oh, payment. Right, uh... sorry, this is all I have.
Pinto needs some crafting materials. Bring 2 <color=#39CCFF>adamant bars</color> to Pinto at the barracks.
Hello, everyone. I am hoping somebody can find 2 <color=#39CCFF>adamant bars</color> for me to use in crafting better armor. Please bring them to Pinto at the barracks, thank you.
Pinto's Posturing
Haha - it is for pranks, actually![]Have these gloves. They don't fit and are too heavy.
Pod is asking for <color=#39CCFF>eggs</color> but it seems like he's up to something. Oh well, bring Pod 5 <color=#39CCFF>eggs</color>.
Help! I need <color=#39CCFF>eggs</color>. It is not for pranks, that isn't what it's for. I need 5 <color=#39CCFF>eggs</color>!
Pod's Prank
Oh, you brought the <color=#39CCFF>apples</color>! This is exactly what we need, thanks farmer. Maybe Pinto will learn to stand up straight while I'm shooting an <color=#39CCFF>apple</color> off his head!
Bring 5 <color=#39CCFF>apples</color> to Roza at the barracks.
NEEDED: 5 <color=#39CCFF>apples</color> to the barracks for target practice. See Roza for payment.
Practice Apples
Thank goodness somebody came through. If I went another sleepless night, I don't know what would happen to me.[]Here farmer, this should cover the record and then some. Thanks a lot!
Raimi is having trouble sleeping. Bring him a <color=#39CCFF>lullaby record </color> from the record store.
Trouble sleeping, need help!
I've heard there's a nice record at the record store that will help me sleep. Can someone bring me a <color=#39CCFF>lullaby record </color>? I haven't slept well in ages, so this would be greatly appreciated!
- Raimi
Raimi's Lullaby
Whew - that will do! This is perfect, farmer. Thanks so much.[]Oh, the <color=#39CCFF>earth fertilizer I</color>? The loser of the race has to use it as a pillow that night. Heheheh...
For some reason, Roza needs a bag of <color=#39CCFF>earth fertilizer I</color> to motivate the soldiers in a relay race. Bring 1 <color=#39CCFF>earth fertilizer I</color> to Roza at the barracks.
NEEDED: 1 BAG OF <color=#39CCFF>EARTH FERTILIZER I</color>
We're running relays at the barracks this week, and I'm making sure the soldiers are motivated. I'm paying 200 gold out-of-pocket for a bag of <color=#39CCFF>earth fertilizer I</color>. The stinkier the better.
Roza's Fertilizer
Oh, now that's a nice specimen. Thanks a lot, farmer. Here, for catching such a beauty.
Apparently, Solon loves <color=#39CCFF>eel</color>. Catch an <color=#39CCFF>eel</color> and bring it to Solon. You can catch <color=#39CCFF>eel</color> while fishing.
Listen up! I want someone to bring me some <color=#39CCFF>eel</color>. It's been too long since I've had my favorite dish, so I'm paying generously. The sooner the better.
Solon's Favorite
So the farmer is the first to show up! The armor you brought looks well-made, too. This should stop those straw dummies from falling apart so quickly - it's impossible to train when my dummies last like five minutes.[]I appreciate it, farmer. Here's that gold for you.
Sophie needs armor for training. Bring a <color=#39CCFF>copper chest plate</color> to Sophie near the Dragon Train to the north of town. You can craft a <color=#39CCFF>copper chest plate</color> with copper ore from the mines.
Attention, citizens!
I am in need of extra armor for training. I'm paying 600 gold for a <color=#39CCFF>copper chest</color>. I'm in a rush to keep training, so hurry up!
- Sophie
Sophie's Armor Quest
All right! I've been waiting for this. When Calvin is off-duty tonight, I'm going to make him eat his words.[]Thanks, farmer. Take this ore like I promised.
Sophie has a wager with Calvin and needs 3 <color=#39CCFF>adamant bars</color>. Bring the <color=#39CCFF>adamant bars</color> to Sophie. You can make <color=#39CCFF>adamant bars</color> by using adamant ore with your smelter.
This is a call asking for 3 <color=#39CCFF>adamant bars</color>. With these bars, I intend to prove Calvin wrong by chopping clean through them with my iron sword. I'm willing to trade 6 mithril ore in return.
Sophie's Strength Test
XX, my hero! This table is so cute, it's perfect. I can't wait to put all my decorations on it. Thanks again, XX!
Craft a <color=#39CCFF>wooden table</color> and bring it to Kitty.
Sprucing Season
Is that really 25 <color=#39CCFF>stones</color>? Uh-oh, I should have asked for more... but this is a real good start. Thank you, farmer!
Topi wants to build a bridge from <color=#39CCFF>stones</color>. Bring him 25 <color=#39CCFF>stones</color> from the mines to do it.
Please help!
I need <color=#39CCFF>stones</color> to build a bridge! I'll need a looooot to build a whole bridge. 25 <color=#39CCFF>stones</color> should be enough!
- Topi
Topi's Bridge
All right, <color=#39CCFF>coal</color>! I'm going to draw pretend tattoos all over Pod. Here, you can have this cool rock I found.
Topi is asking for 5 <color=#39CCFF>coal</color> so he and Pod can draw on each other. Against your better judgment, bring Topi 5 <color=#39CCFF>coal</color>.
Hello! This is Topi. I want <color=#39CCFF>coal</color> so Pod and I can draw on each other. Please bring 5 <color=#39CCFF>coal</color>!
Topi's Tattoos
Hey, my <color=#39CCFF>stones</color>! Thanks a bunch, farmer. You're a true neighbor.
Dr. Wornhardt needs help keeping his office tidy. Bring him 5 <color=#39CCFF>stones</color> to help keep the wind from blowing his papers around. You can find <color=#39CCFF>stones</color> in the mines.
If anyone has the time, I could use some help keeping my office in order. I love working with the window open, but the wind always blows my papers to the floor. Can someone just bring me 5 <color=#39CCFF>stones</color> to help weigh them down? That would be awesome!
Wornhardt's Paperweights
Are these the logs I needed? After this, the hospital will never run out of tongue depressors again! In fact, I may have gone a bit overboard asking for so many <color=#39CCFF>logs</color>...[]Oh well - thanks for coming through!
The hospital is short on tongue depressors. Bring Dr. Wornhardt 25 <color=#39CCFF>logs</color> so the hospital never runs out again.
The hospital needs your help!
For anyone who has time to spare, I could really use a hand with supplies. I'm almost completely out of tongue depressors at the hospital. If someone can deliver 25 <color=#39CCFF>logs</color> to me, I would never run out again! Thanks in advance!

Human
Elf
Elves are one of the oldest races in the world and are mystically attuned to the flow of life energy around them. Friends to all plants and animals, they are most at home in forests. However, younger members of this race are now spreading out into the world and creating villages where Elves have never been seen before.
Demon
Cunning and resourceful, Demons are creatures of darkness. They thrive in the shadow of night and are driven by their appetite for strength. For what is life's purpose if not to maintain power? This is the Demons' creed.
Angel
With grace unmatched, Angels are beacons of light in the darkest skies. They act as watchers of the world and chronicle the history of everything they see. While not every Angel holds to the exact same principles, whatever path they choose they will walk with complete devotion.
Amari
The origins of the Amari exist only as unfounded myth. What <i>is</i> known is that the Amari are strongly linked to their primal spirits, making them loyal allies who are in touch with the wilds of the world.
Elemental
The oldest of all races, Elementals exist as ethereal beings with bodies of whipping flame or flowing water. All that is known about them is that they are the result of nature’s chaotic elements mixed with strange and powerful magic. It is thought that the elementals alive today are the same that have existed for all time since they seem to have no natural lifespan.
Naga
The Naga are a secretive race, living underground for generations to keep their culture unspoiled by outside influence. Because they have hid from the surface for so long, they have learned most everything about subterranean living. Survival is the keystone of their culture.

Arts & Expression
Elven culture is centered around artistic expression in many forms. Foremost is woodcraft - Elves are considered the most careful and skilled woodworkers to exist worldwide. Horticulture - the art of trimming and shaping plants - is also a celebrated form of expression.
Elves have also been known to paint symbols of cultural significance on their houses as well. These symbols can be sigils of health and peace as well as low enchantments for protection and luck. The same symbols are carried over into their rich tradition of tattooing, which is a sign of spiritual maturity among Elves.
Cultural Values
<i>Nature & Harmony</i>
Elven values are based on the teachings of Nel'Vari's guardian dragon, Nivara. Nivara, also called the World Dragon, teaches the power of peace and harmony with nature. Her connection with nature allows her to practice advanced magical abilities.
<i>Protective Secrecy</i>
Being the peaceful people they are, Elves have historically been trusting of other cultures. This trust, unfortunately, has led to catastrophe within Nel'Vari. In response, the Elves of Nel'Vari have taken a position of secrecy, allowing only select guests to walk within the city's boundaries. The city itself is protected by an illusion that prevents potential foes from ever finding it.

System.Void Wish.MarriageCutscene::SetNPCOneLiners()||Hey, good job on getting married. Hope you have lots of happy years together, and all that. So is there going to be any food, or...
System.Void Wish.MarriageCutscene::SetNPCOneLiners()||This is so different from an Elven wedding... Oh - still nice though!
System.Void Wish.MarriageCutscene::SetNPCOneLiners()||Oh, XX. I'm so happy for you! If you ever need any advice, you know where to go.
System.Void Wish.MarriageCutscene::SetNPCOneLiners()||Congratulations, congratulations! You make such a cute cute couple, nya!

System.Void Wish.MarriageCutscene::SetNPCOneLiners()||Don't worry, I was on alert through the whole ceremony.
System.Void Wish.MarriageCutscene::SetNPCOneLiners()||Human ceremonies are so much more practical than Elven ones. It's funny how our cultures differ, even in celebration.
System.Void Wish.MarriageCutscene::SetNPCOneLiners()||What a wonderful ceremony! It's good to have nice things like this to focus on. It's not just a special day for you, you know. The whole town is celebrating
System.Void Wish.MarriageCutscene::SetNPCOneLiners()||This was... pretty boring.

System.Boolean Wish.TimeOfNeedCutscene2/<SceneRoutine>d__4::MoveNext()||At last you're here, XX.[]My suspicions were correct. A powerful spell has been cast over the monster city of Withergate, creating an everlasting darkness.[]This spell prevents my entry into the city, and at its source is the Moon Dragon, Dynus.[]Dynus conceals himself behind the safety of his spell while the darkness spreads over our world. If this spell reaches us, Sun Haven will be shrouded in eternal darkness...[]........[]XX, I believe you have come to Sun Haven for a reason. I gave you my blessing because I sensed a greater power within you.[]Your power and wit is the key to our success. As I myself cannot confront Dynus, it is you who must stop his dark magic, XX.[]I realize I am asking you to walk a dangerous path, but you need not walk it alone.[]For guidance, travel west to the elven city Nel'Vari and find the World Dragon, Nivara. I know the Elven city is mere myth to the Humans, but it is as real as the dirt beneath your feet.[]Gaining entry will be difficult. The entrance to Nel'Vari lies deep in the <b>Western Forest</b>, guarded by a mysterious puzzle. The key to the puzzle, I do not know.[]However, the Elves consider their culture to be sacred. Learning more about the Elves could provide insight to the puzzle's solution.[]I, too, have some teachings that will better prepare you to face Dynus. However, you will need to grow in strength before training with me.[]Ultimately, it is up to you to decide which path to take, but be warned, facing Dynus in your current state would be quite dangerous.[]XX, I suggest you train with Nivara and myself before confronting the Moon Dragon. But of course, this is your journey.[]Go now. Prepare yourself. You must face Dynus and save Sun Haven from a dark fate!

System.Boolean Wish.ConfrontingDynusCutscene2/<SceneRoutine>d__7::MoveNext()||I need to speak with Dynus.
System.Boolean Wish.ConfrontingDynusCutscene2/<SceneRoutine>d__7::MoveNext()||Yes, my advisor Xyla mentioned that. You're new here, yet <i>so very eager</i> to see Dynus. Why?

System.Boolean Wish.ConfrontingDynusCutscene2/<SceneRoutine>d__7::MoveNext()||Sun Haven wants to give itself to Dynus.
System.Boolean Wish.ConfrontingDynusCutscene2/<SceneRoutine>d__7::MoveNext()||Why in the world would you want that?

System.Boolean Wish.ConfrontingDynusCutscene2/<SceneRoutine>d__7::MoveNext()||This has nothing to do with that.
System.Boolean Wish.ConfrontingDynusCutscene2/<SceneRoutine>d__7::MoveNext()||I'm sorry for what happened to the monsterfolk. I just want to talk to Dynus.
System.Boolean Wish.ConfrontingDynusCutscene2/<SceneRoutine>d__7::MoveNext()||Regardless, there's nothing you can do to stop the Moon Dragon from casting his spell. He's too powerful to be stopped.
System.Boolean Wish.ConfrontingDynusCutscene2/<SceneRoutine>d__7::MoveNext()||Why in the world would Sun Haven want to give itself up like that?
System.Boolean Wish.ConfrontingDynusCutscene2/<SceneRoutine>d__7::MoveNext()||Because Sun Haven is bankrupt.
System.Boolean Wish.ConfrontingDynusCutscene2/<SceneRoutine>d__7::MoveNext()||Because Dynus is so powerful.

System.Boolean Wish.ConfrontingDynusCutscene2/<SceneRoutine>d__7::MoveNext()||Who cares what he thinks? He's a weakling.
System.Boolean Wish.ConfrontingDynusCutscene2/<SceneRoutine>d__7::MoveNext()||It was Elios's idea.

Dialogue||Nonsense, I'll get looking right away!
Dialogue||You're right, I'm way too busy.
Dialogue||Well, if you insist! I'll surely make it worth your time if you return it to me. 
Dialogue||I understand. We all have our own sails to trim, after all. 
Dialogue||Hey XX, want to lend a hand to our construction effort? We're short on some stone... and funds.
Dialogue||What kind of construction are you doing?
Dialogue||Where can I get stone?
Dialogue||How can I help?
Dialogue||We're finishing up the floor of this event space so we can get more merchants into town.[]We just need a little more stone and gold to pay our workers, then we're as good as done!

Dialogue||So disappointing, nyan... 
Dialogue||XX, I was hoping to bump into you. If you have a moment to spare, I could use your help with something.
Dialogue||Why are you asking me?
Dialogue||Where should I go?
Dialogue||I would do it myself, but Liam scheduled a last-minute session with me. I wouldn't ask you if I didn't need to.

Dialogue||Hi there, XX. You always seem to have perfect timing - thanks to Pinto's clumsiness, I've got a job for you.
Dialogue||What did Pinto do?
Dialogue||What do you need?
Dialogue||Pinto was sent to gather coal to heat the barracks at night, but he dropped the whole basket into the river on the way back.[]I guess there was a bee involved. He seemed embarrassed, so I didn't ask questions.

Dialogue||I'll get right on it!
Dialogue||Fantastic! You're a real credit to Sun Haven, XX. You can bring the coal to me. 
Dialogue||Really? That's too bad. It'll be a chilly night in the barracks. 
Dialogue||Oh, XX. Are you headed to the mines? I'm working on a big order and could use your help.
Dialogue||Can't Lynn help?
Dialogue||What do you need me to do?
Dialogue||I have Lynn working on her tempering right now. I'd rather let her focus.
Dialogue||Would you bring me 10 coal? Soon as possible would be best.
Dialogue||I'll get right on that.
Dialogue||Sorry, I can't right now.
Dialogue||Thanks, kid. 
Dialogue||Ah well, I'll just have to send Lynn down the mines then. 
Dialogue||XX, I have a favor to ask you. I'd like to test a theory I read about. If all goes well, it could end up helping everyone in Sun Haven! Can you lend me a hand?
Dialogue||What's the theory?
Dialogue||I read an article about how bright colors can help raise people's moods subconsciously. Just by being around brighter colors, several test subjects were seen to have improved moods over time.
Dialogue||I'd like you to take these flowers and plant them in specific places all around town. That way, everyone will see them and hopefully get a little happier over time.
Dialogue||I'd love to help test the theory!
Dialogue||I'm too busy to help you.
Dialogue||That's great! Take these four flower plants. Please plant them around town and find me when you're done! 
Dialogue||I see. That's okay, I understand. If you happen to find yourself with some free time, come find me. 
Dialogue||Hey farmer, how's my breath? Hm, you didn't even flinch. No, this won't work.
Dialogue||What are you talking about?
Dialogue||I'm trying to make my breath smell bad. It's to keep people from talking to me at the tavern. I've been getting a lot of attention lately, so I thought up this genius plan!
Dialogue||Well obviously my breath isn't stinky enough. Can you cook me a meal with fish? <b>Fish Tempura with Fried Noodles</b> should do the trick.
Dialogue||Okay, I'm on it.
Dialogue||Great, get that back to me in a hurry! I'll pay you, of course. 
Dialogue||Fine then. Maybe I'll muster up the courage to ask Peter... 
Dialogue||Oh, hello there XX. I've heard that you're quite helpful around town. I have a task I could use a hand with, if you have the time.
Dialogue||What kind of a task is it?
Dialogue||Some of the decorative banners around town are looking a tad tattered. I need to repair them to keep Sun Haven looking ship-shape.
Dialogue||If you can bring me some fabric to asssit the repairs, that would be greatly appreciated.
Dialogue||I'll do it!
Dialogue||Fantastic! I'll repay you kindly, of course. 
Dialogue||Oh dear... 
Dialogue||Hey farmer, are you headed by the library?
Dialogue||Why do you ask?
Dialogue||Amanda left her book in my boat last night. I don't really have time to return it today, but I know how much she loves her books.
Dialogue||I was hoping you could return Amanda's book for me. She should be at the library - like always.
Dialogue||I really appreciate it XX. And I know Amanada does, too! 
Dialogue||That's too bad, the army pays well. 
Dialogue||
Dialogue||
Dialogue||Hey Mari, XX is here. I bet they can settle this. What do you say, XX, want to settle a bet for us?
Dialogue||Do you two bet against each other often?
Dialogue||What are the stakes?
Dialogue||What's the bet?
Dialogue||Sure, we keep things interesting. Sometimes we disagree, but it's more fun to make a bet out of it!
Dialogue||If you prove me wrong, I'll give you our most expensive meal. On the house!
Dialogue||I say nobody in town is brave enough to go to the forest and slay 5 leaf monsters. Even the guards seem too soft! As usual, Mari thinks I'm wrong.
Dialogue||Sure, I'll prove you wrong!
Dialogue||Maybe next time.
Dialogue||Big talk! But let's see how you feel when you're staring those monsters in the face. 
Dialogue||You see? I knew he didn't have it in him. 
Dialogue||Excuse me! Do you have time to spare? I've lost something dear to me - a sword from my younger days as a knight.
Dialogue||Do you remember where you had it last?
Dialogue||Sure, sure. Let's see... I went for a walk in the forest... the eastern forest... and brought my sword for protection... a monster jumped out of a bush and scared me, so I ran back to town.[]I suppose it must have unclipped from my belt when I ran.
Dialogue||If you could check the eastern forest and find my old sword, I would be very grateful to you.
Dialogue||Oh great, thank you youngster! I'll be waiting for you. 
Dialogue||XX! I've heard good things about you. Supposedly you have a variety of skills. I'm hoping one of those skills is combat.
Dialogue||What's going on?
Dialogue||Those blasted monkeys gave me a serious thrashing this morning. They're too dangerous. We need to do something.
Dialogue||Slay some monkeys, and get me their bananas. Hopefully the rest will get the message. Come find me when you're done and I'll gladly pay you.
Dialogue||I'm too busy to help right now.
Dialogue||I can't wait to teach these monkeys a lesson. 
Dialogue||That's disappointing. Hopefully someone else will step up to the challenge. 
Dialogue||Hey, XX! I need your help, but you have to keep it a secret. You promise you won't tell?
Dialogue||What's up?
Dialogue||Okay, I promise. How can I help?
Dialogue||Sorry, I need you to promise you won't tell or I could get in trouble.
Dialogue||My parents have been telling me I need to be more responsible lately and then I go and lose my notebook! It has all my schoolwork inside. Can you find it for me?
Dialogue||I'll find your notebook, Topi.
Dialogue||Sorry, I can't help right now.
Dialogue||What a relief. You're a lifesaver, XX. 
Dialogue||Aw... Dad was right, I am irresponsible. I guess I better start doing my homework, again. 
Dialogue||Hey, XX! Can you help me make a necklace?
Dialogue||A necklace?
Dialogue||Mama likes seashells so I want to make a necklace with seashells and fishing string. I already have the string. I found it in the garbage!
Dialogue||I'm not allowed at the beach on my own but I need seashells. Bring me 5 seashells so I can make a really good necklace. I mean, please!
Dialogue||I'm on it, Pod.
Dialogue||I can't wait! 
Dialogue||I'll never be able to make a necklace now... 
Dialogue||*Yawn* Sorry, did you say something? I'm so bored I almost fell asleep... Hey listen, do me a favor. Bring me a book to read, would you? I can't get caught sleeping on duty again.
Dialogue||Where should I go to get the book?
Dialogue||What kind of book do you want?
Dialogue||If you chop a tree down and make paper out of it, you can write a book from scratch. Or just go to the library, your choice.[]I know it's on the other side of town, but try not to get sidetracked.
Dialogue||Something to keep me awake. Maybe something funny? Look for a joke book, if they have one.
Dialogue||Okay, I'll get a book for you.
Dialogue||Thanks, citizen. I'll be here. Like always. 
Dialogue||Figures. Hopefully I don't nod off, or I'll be scrubbing the latrine for a week. 
Dialogue||People around town say that you're a helpful neighbor. Want to prove it?
Dialogue||Prove it how?
Dialogue||I'm craving fish for dinner, but I won't have time to stop by the store today. Besides, fresh fish is way better than store-bought.
Dialogue||If you catch me a fresh Seabass for dinner, it would really make my day.
Dialogue||I'm too busy to help.
Dialogue||You will? Okay neighbor, come find me when you've made a catch. 
Dialogue||Turns out your reputation was just nonsense after all. 
Dialogue||It used to be that young folk like you would help us old folk when we needed it. What do you say, are you willing to lend me a hand?
Dialogue||You don't seem to have any trouble getting around.
Dialogue||You don't look that old!
Dialogue||What do you need help with?
Dialogue||I would do it myself, but my knee is acting up again. I try not to show it to keep people from worrying.
Dialogue||Oh, aren't you sweet. Believe me, I feel my age. 
Dialogue||The weeds are eating up my yard again. I just need someone to cut them back for me.
Dialogue||No problem, I'll take care of it.
Dialogue||I'm sorry, I can't right now.
Dialogue||It's nice to see that the younger generation still has some respect for their elders. 
Dialogue||I guess things really have changed. Nobody has time to help a neighbor anymore. 
Dialogue||Welcome, XX. Say, are you busy? If not, do you want to be?
Dialogue||I'm waiting on an order. It's some medicine that Catherine ordered for me, but it's taking longer than expected.
Dialogue||I wondered if you could stop by Catherine's shop to check on my order.
Dialogue||I can do that for you!
Dialogue||Fantastic! I'll be waiting. 
Dialogue||Oh, that's too bad. 
Dialogue||I'm sorry, were you standing there long? I'm so wrapped up in these late fees that I didn't see you come in.
Dialogue||What late fees?
Dialogue||Do you need help?
Dialogue||We charge people for keeping books past their due date. It's some good extra income, but people don't always pay on time.[]Four people owe late fees but none have paid yet and I can't leave to track these people down. It's just a little frustrating.
Dialogue||Not unless you can collect each of these late fees and bring them back here.
Dialogue||Sorry, I can't help with that.
Dialogue||Wow - really? That would be tremendous! Here's the list of people who owe fees. Please come right back when you're finished. 
Dialogue||Don't worry, I wasn't expecting you to. I just wish people took more responsibility for their debts. 
Dialogue||Rise and shine, XX! I hope you don't mind me waiting here. Hey, it looks like your farm is already shaping up.[]Anyway, it's time to plan your first visit to Dragon's Meet. XX, are you ready to meet Elios?
Dialogue||Dragon's Meat?
Dialogue||That's "meet," with two e's. It's where Elios lives on the mountaintop. New neighbors in Sun Haven make the trek to get Elios's blessing as kind of a rite of passage.
Dialogue||The ascent to Dragon's Meet can be dangerous, so I'll escort you up the mountain myself. Just meet me in front of Town Hall tomorrow at 10 am and we'll be on our way.
Dialogue||Sounds like a plan, I'm in!
Dialogue||I'm too busy for this right now.
Dialogue||Perfect! I'll be waiting for you at the Town Hall tomorrow morning. 
Dialogue||Oh, I see. In that case, please talk to me as soon as you have some free time. I just can't wait for Elios to give you his blessing! 
Dialogue||Hey XX, this is perfect timing! I just realized I forgot to water my garden before coming in today. I'll give you a potion if you help me out.
Dialogue||Where is your garden?
Dialogue||It's just on the side of my house, you know, stuck in the dirt like plants are.
Dialogue||Just make sure all my leafy babies have enough water. I'd be crushed if they withered in the sunshine. Let me know when you've finished so I can repay you.
Dialogue||I'll take care of that.
Dialogue||Great. You're really helping me out, XX. 
Dialogue||I guess someone doesn't want a top-quality potion. 
Dialogue||Hey, XX! Since you're the only farmer in town, I thought you could help me out.
Dialogue||Why do you need a farmer?
Dialogue||I need someone to grow my Cinaberry plant for me, but nobody has a free plot of dirt. Then I remembered, duh, XX has plenty of free dirt!
Dialogue||The thing is, I have a new kind of fertilizer that I'd like to test. Will you try it out for me? I'll give you the seeds to try it with and everything!
Dialogue||Oh, perfect! I can't wait to see what crops up! 
Dialogue||Oh. Well, I understand. 
Dialogue||Hey XX, I've got a job for you. I need some meat.
Dialogue||Meat?
Dialogue||Yeah. Doesn't matter what kind of meat. Doesn't even need to be cooked. I'd do it myself, but I just don't have the time.
Dialogue||Bring some meat my way and I'll give you some coin.
Dialogue||I can do that for you.
Dialogue||Great, thanks a lot. 
Dialogue||Well then, that's that. 
Dialogue||XX! I need your help, please!
Dialogue||What's wrong?
Dialogue||I spilled Liam's big bag of flour on the way home and now he needs to go buy more. I feel so bad!
Dialogue||Can you bring me 5 flour to surprise Liam? If you do, you'll be my favorite!
Dialogue||I'll take care of that for you!
Dialogue||Yay, thank you XX! 
Dialogue||Now who will help me? 
Dialogue||What happened to my arm? I took a tumble in the mines. My cap fell off my head and the light went out. I got so flustered that I forgot my cap down there! Shame, too. That was my favorite mining cap.
Dialogue||What does it look like?
Dialogue||Sorry to hear about your cap. Maybe you'll find another one like it.
Dialogue||It's green with a light on the front - but I think it's burned out.
Dialogue||Doubtful, that cap was made for me by my grandmother. Nobody makes a cap like Mammy.
Dialogue||I can find your cap for you!
Dialogue||I hope you find your cap.
Dialogue||Well how about that! I'd be remarkably grateful if you did. 
Dialogue||Me too. 
Dialogue||XX, my sweet. I was thinking of you while painting the other night.
Dialogue||Hey, how come you haven't painted me yet?
Dialogue||Do you have any goals as a painter, Jun?
Dialogue||Oh, um, well... I don't want to lie to you, XX. There's a chance that I already have.
Dialogue||It would be nice to paint a large mural one day. But otherwise, painting is just how I relax. I don't feel the need to put pressure on it with too many big goals. Does that make sense?
Dialogue||That's so thoughtful!
Dialogue||You painted me without telling me? I don't know how I feel about that.
Dialogue||Oh good! I was worried you might be uncomfortable with it.[]It was one day that I noticed you in your field with the sun setting behind you, and I was simply inspired.
Dialogue||I'm sorry if that's uncomfortable. One day I noticed you in your field with the sun setting behind you, and I was simply inspired.
Dialogue||I get it - making it competitive would ruin the hobby.
Dialogue||I get it - it's just for yourself, not others.
Dialogue||Some people can't separate their ambitions from their hobbies, which leads them to quit doing something they love just because they don't get recognition.[]I'm glad you aren't one of those people, XX.
Dialogue||I bet you wish you were a Slime like me. Slime life!													
Dialogue||Hey there, XX. Just stopping by?
Dialogue||Oh, just visiting the best merchant in Sun Haven.
Dialogue||Have you always worked alone?
Dialogue||Didn't I tell you once before that I don't give discounts based on compliments? Heck, I don't give discounts at all.
Dialogue||Aside from my old mentor, nobody's ever worked with me but me.
Dialogue||That just sounds like smart business to me.
Dialogue||That's nothing to be proud of, you know.
Dialogue||It's easy to be smart about your business when you work alone. No coworkers to disagree with you, and no splitting profits!
Dialogue||Whatever, it's decisions like that that helped me rise to the top.
Dialogue||It must be easier working alone.
Dialogue||It must be a challenge working alone.
Dialogue||Eh, depends on the business. I planned for my own success - as you can see - so being alone is what works best for me.[]Sometimes I consider taking on a partner, but then I count my money and forget about it.
Dialogue||Remind me, your name is XX? I don't mean to be rude, I just have a lot on my mind.[]Do you have a question for me?
Dialogue||What do you do here?
Dialogue||Have you received a blessing from Nivara?
Dialogue||I'm an enchantress, so I use magic to make life easier. At least, that's the idea... Heh, sometimes my experiments have unexpected results.
Dialogue||Oh, yes, so very fascinating. Talk about power, I can't even begin to understand the magic she wields. But that's expected of a dragon's power, I guess.
Dialogue||What made you want to be an enchantress?
Dialogue||How does your magic make life easier?
Dialogue||Oh my, that's a big question. I guess nature and magic are just such huge bodies of knowledge, so the chance to combine the two... who could pass that up??
Dialogue||Mainly by helping the ecosystem - keeping plants alive year-round, making trees grow from rocks, that sort of thing.[]Not to mention, my favorite berries are always in season now!
Dialogue||Maybe you should study her.
Dialogue||I'm sure your magic is powerful, too.
Dialogue||There are certain lines that even researchers shouldn't cross. As an ethical enchantress, I refuse to do research on Nivara. Her magic isn't for us.
Dialogue||Oh, thanks! My enchantments aren't exactly on par with Nivara's, but they get the job done.
Dialogue||Oh, you again. Don't you have anyone else to bother? Friends or family?
Dialogue||So who do you usually spend time with around here?
Dialogue||Do you have family here? Or, at all?
Dialogue||The king and prince, obviously. Then Cordelia, since she's on the royal council with me. You know, I don't spend a lot of time with many other people... except you, for some reason.[]Why <i>do</i> I bother with you, anyway? Ugh, I'm starting to worry about my sanity.
Dialogue||No, no family here or anywhere that I know of. Before you start up with the pity party - I don't care. I can do whatever I want, whenever I want. So don't throw any feelings my way, okay?
Dialogue||It sounds like you don't have many friends.
Dialogue||I know you like me, even if you won't admit it!
Dialogue||That's about right, and I'm better off for it. I don't need more people wasting my time and filling my head with their dumb thoughts. I get plenty of that from you!
Dialogue||Maybe you're right, maybe I've finally lost it...[]Living in this city has softened me up too much - I need to pick a fight with somebody. I'd choose you, but I actually want a challenge.
Dialogue||Pity? You? Please.
Dialogue||It's obvious you miss your mommy.
Dialogue||You're finally starting to sound like you belong here.
Dialogue||I can't tell if you tried for a joke, or if you're just that stupid.
Dialogue||Taking good care of your weapons, XX?
Dialogue||Asking about my weapons is a bit random for you, Wornhardt.
Dialogue||What about you? Do you take good care of your stuff?
Dialogue||Haha, it is, isn't it? But the best medicine is preventative. When you're out there putting yourself in harm's way, your first "medicine" is your armor and weapons.[]So keep them in good condition, and stay safe out there for me!
Dialogue||Fair question! To answer it, of course I do. I always make sure to have fresh scalpels and needles on hand! Only the sharpest, for best results.[]I never want to put in less than maximum effort in what I do. Anything less is selling the people I care about short.
Dialogue||You've got it, doctor!
Dialogue||I'll be fine, don't worry so much.
Dialogue||I try not to overstep when it comes to telling my patients how to live their lives, but I do want to make sure everyone is taking care of themselves.[]Thanks for understanding, XX!
Dialogue||Please don't think I'm nagging you, XX. I'm just worried about your health and safety.
Dialogue||You sure think two steps ahead.
Dialogue||That does make a lot of sense.
Dialogue||Hey, I tell Solon to never overdo it with his blacksmithing. I always remind Anne to lift her boxes and crates with the legs, not the back.[]The best way to cure an injury is to not have it in the first place!
Dialogue||Your smile is bright as the sun, XX. I hope your day has been good so far!
Dialogue||I only smile like this when I see you!
Dialogue||Are you happy in our relationship, Wornhardt? 
Dialogue||You're such a cheeseball! I've actually heard of studies done on smiles. The idea is, people who smile more are healthier and live longer.
Dialogue||Am I... XX, I'm the happiest I've been! If we were stuck together for the rest of our lives, it wouldn't be long enough![]Oh, heh. I didn't mean to suggest anything by that...
Dialogue||If that's true, then we're going to live a looong time.
Dialogue||That doesn't sound very scientific.
Dialogue||I'll have to make sure you get your daily dose!
Dialogue||Maybe not. I honestly can't vouch for the credibility of the study, but it's a fun thought anyway.[]Can you imagine if I wrote a prescription for smiles?
Dialogue||I could spend the rest of my life with you, too.
Dialogue||It's difficult for me to picture anything lasting that long...
Dialogue||I don't mean to ruin the moment, but we are talking about marriage, right? Sometimes I can be a bit oblivious to social cues, heh.[]In any case, I'm ready whenever you're ready.
Dialogue||Oh, sure, I see. Maybe you're not ready to take that step, XX - and that's fine. But whenever you are... I'll be here.
Dialogue||You'll have an easy time getting to know Sun Haven, XX, I just know it.
Dialogue||It's about time I learned something about farming, don't you think?																	
Dialogue||I'm trying to choose between crossbows and swords. I have terrible aim, but swords are so heavy...								
Dialogue||It's nice having a new neighbor. I hope you like playing games!
Dialogue||What is your favorite thing about living here?
Dialogue||I bet you know a lot about Sun Haven. What should I know?
Dialogue||I like that I live right next to Pod. It makes playtime easier. Lucia is real pretty, too.[]Oh, don't tell anyone I said that!
Dialogue||The beach is the best place to find seashells. I have the biggest collection in town!
Dialogue||I'm going to tell!
Dialogue||I won't tell.
Dialogue||Noooo! We won't be friends if you do!
Dialogue||Oh good... My friends would never stop making fun if they found out.
Dialogue||What do you do with them? 
Dialogue||I'm going to make an even bigger collection!
Dialogue||Oh, nothing I guess. They're just pretty, is all.
Dialogue||Yeah right - you're on!
Dialogue||Hello... Are you here to visit me?
Dialogue||Sure! My name is XX.
Dialogue||XX... Good to meet you. My name is Caspera. My mom says I'm the youngest kid to ever be invited to the Demon King's castle!
Dialogue||How are you today, XX?
Dialogue||How are <i>you</i> doing, Jun?
Dialogue||I've been busy with... farmer things.
Dialogue||Oh, hah. Caught me off guard for a second. I'm so used to asking how everyone else is doing that I never stop to think about myself.[]I'm actually doing just fine, thank you for asking. I love asking others how they're doing, but it's good to be asked myself every once in awhile.
Dialogue||From what I can tell, "farmer things" seems to be all sorts of stuff! It's actually amazing, everything you seem to do.[]I like to think a little bit of your energy has rubbed off on everyone.
Dialogue||Keep up the good spirits, Sun Haven relies on you!
Dialogue||This counselor stuff seems like a breeze.
Dialogue||Don't I know it. It's a big task, but it's one I'm glad to take up. Positive reinforcement like yours makes it all the easier, though. So thanks for that, really.
Dialogue||There's much more to being a counselor than just asking how someone is doing, XX.[]I appreciate you asking me how I'm doing, but please don't go off and try to give people counseling...
Dialogue||I'm glad to help Sun Haven.
Dialogue||I suppose I haven't noticed.
Dialogue||I'm sure you are! It's good our town has so many dedicated people living in it. Maybe we aren't as big as the Great City, but we have a lot of heart.[]It's why I like to keep up to date on everyone and see how they're doing.
Dialogue||Well, you're always pretty busy so there's nothing odd about that. It's my job to keep up with everyone on their day-to-day feelings, though.[]It's why I like to catch up with people and see how they're doing. 
Dialogue||XX, listen listen! Last night I had a dream that was the most strangest dream ever. I wasn't Kitty at all, but a Human!
Dialogue||A Human? That is weird.
Dialogue||Do you have many dreams like that?
Dialogue||It felt so strange! No claws, no reflexes, no smells. I don't know how Humans live every day like that, nyaan!
Dialogue||Not so many like that, nya. I do have dreams though! My favorite is when I'm flying in the air, and then I catch the birdies right out of the sky!
Dialogue||Was there anything about it that you liked?
Dialogue||At least it was only for a night!
Dialogue||Well, my ears didn't itch so much. Did you know my ears get so so itchy all the time, nya? When the wind messes up my fur, it itches - itchy itchy!
Dialogue||True true! If Kitty had to be that way all the time... I don't even like to think about it, nyan!
Dialogue||That sounds like fun!
Dialogue||Poor birds!
Dialogue||The next time you dream about flying, you should try to catch a birdie too! Then tell Kitty aaaallll about it, nya!
Dialogue||Nyan? They're not real, silly XX.[]Kitty doesn't hurt animals in real life. Except maybe fish for dinner...
Dialogue||Hello. Having a good day I hope?
Dialogue||You feeling okay, XX? You're looking a little green. Hey wait... Nevermind - it was a trick of the light.
Dialogue||Ah XX, the cold night air is refreshing, yes?
Dialogue||The darkness is quite invigorating.
Dialogue||The Moon Dragon's power has made a wonderful community here.
Dialogue||Yes, quite so. It makes me feel like I could build or raze a castle all on my own.[]When my people were forced to endure sunlight we were severely limited in what we could get done, especially when it came to securing our city.
Dialogue||It's true that we owe our gratitude to Dynus, though debt to a dragon isn't truly something I relish.
Dialogue||Thank goodness for Withergate's darkness, then.
Dialogue||That all seems a problem of the past, at least.
Dialogue||Hm, yes. Fortunate, though it is not something to rely on forever. Until my family holds the key to eternal darkness for themselves, that is.
Dialogue||It is. But complacency is the death of power, XX. I won't rest until my hold on power is absolute, but you knew that.
Dialogue||Do you believe you could achieve darkness without Dynus's magic?
Dialogue||Don't you think you'll always be indebted to Dynus?
Dialogue||Dragons are large, XX. But the world is far larger. If Dynus is capable of creating eternal darkness, then why can't I find the same power somewhere out there? Perhaps someday...
Dialogue||The thought of that brings the taste of steel to my mouth... One day, I will sever our reliance to the Moon Dragon.
Dialogue||I'm trying to organize a big sale and here you are, trying to flirt with me! You're lucky I love it.																	
Dialogue||Honestly, it's not the biggest ring I've ever seen. But it's certainly the most meaningful - because it's from you.																																		
Dialogue||Have you heard about the monster city? Don't worry, the army will always protect Sun Haven.			 					
Dialogue||Are you getting to know the town very well? You'll learn your way around just like I did when I was new here.
Dialogue||Where are you from, anyway?
Dialogue||Do you ever miss your hometown?
Dialogue||I grew up in the Great City as an army baby - my mom was a captain when she adopted me. Obviously, I followed in her footsteps.
Dialogue||Sometimes, but that's the life of a soldier. I'll be comfortable when I'm old and wrinkled, but for now I'll do my part. Duty through service!
Dialogue||Is she the whole reason you chose a military career?
Dialogue||It makes sense that you would become a soldier, too.
Dialogue||I don't know if that's entirely why, but it's definitely part of it. Growing up in a military house was tough, but it gave me the backbone to carry myself forward.[]Also, it keeps me in really great shape!
Dialogue||I'm glad you think so. Sometimes I wonder if I did it only to make my mom proud, but then I remember how much I really like the job and I quit thinking about it.
Dialogue||You're a great soldier. I'm sure you'll be promoted in no time!
Dialogue||I could never live a life of subservience like that.
Dialogue||Thanks! I know it would make my mom proud to see me rank up a bit... Then again, she knows firsthand that it's a long climb to the top.
Dialogue||I'm not asking you to agree with it, but I will ask you to respect it. The soldiers of the Great Army put themselves at risk for your safety every day.
Dialogue||I love my big ol' wheat field. I've got it so easy, wheat is so simple to grow! Nothing like your work, I'm sure, XX.
Dialogue||Do you ever have trouble keeping up with your field?
Dialogue||It's amazing that you grow and mill your own flour.
Dialogue||Nope, not really. The first few years it was rough controlling the weeds, but after working the soil enough they don't get too bad anymore.
Dialogue||You think so, XX? Heh, I mostly just like that it cuts down on ordering from someone else. Business deals are always so formal and serious, it's really awkward for me.
Dialogue||Harvesting must be a pain, though.
Dialogue||It's a pretty well-kept field. 
Dialogue||Well, that's certainly not the easiest. Emma and Elizabeth both can't wait to get old enough to help, though! They're the best.
Dialogue||Oh shoot, XX, you really think that? That would mean a lot coming from anyone, but you're a farmer! So it's extra meaningful.
Dialogue||You can't expect to run a business if you can't handle that kind of stuff.
Dialogue||You do what you gotta do to get by, no judging.
Dialogue||When you put it that way, it really makes me seem like I'm just avoiding my problems. Ugh, time for a walk, maybe...
Dialogue||Heh, thanks. I always feel silly saying it out loud, but I'm glad you understand how I feel. It makes me feel... less silly about it.
Dialogue||I've been wondering lately, what is life outside of Nel'Vari like? In the lands and cities beyond.
Dialogue||What has you wondering about the world outside Nel'Vari?
Dialogue||It varies widely, depending on where you go.
Dialogue||I've lived in Nel'Vari for a very long time. I know how everything works here. How the people go about their days, and the powers that make our society tick.[]I might be an Enchanter, but I've given everything around here at least a cursory try before.[]But what's it like outside of Nel'Vari? What sort of fundamental power turns the wheels in places like Sun Haven?
Dialogue||The power of Enchanting has so deeply altered how we are able to live and work in Nel'Vari, it's strange but fun to sometimes imagine how we'd get by without it.[]I would never want to leave Nel'Vari, but it does makes me wonder... Would I still be the same Iris if I were born in Sun Haven?
Dialogue||I'd love to tell you all about it sometime.
Dialogue||Go out and see for yourself sometime!
Dialogue||It would be incredibly interesting to hear. Thank you for understanding my curiosity, and thank you even more for offering to sate it.
Dialogue||No thanks, XX. You should I know prefer to stay relatively close to Nel'Vari. I just wanted to ask you a question, I didn't expect you to try pushing me like this.
Dialogue||You would always be you, no matter what. 
Dialogue||If you weren't born in Nel'Vari you'd be a totally different person. 
Dialogue||Hmm, you really believe so? That's also an interesting thought! Iris the Human, experimenting on... cows, or... rocks. Or whatever it is they use over there.
Dialogue||That's such a tough thing to think, even if you might be right. I don't <i>want</i> to ever be different. I want to be Iris! Maybe I should stop thinking about the outside world. 
Dialogue||Have you heard any good records lately? I love having music in the background.								
Dialogue||The day always improves when I bump into you, XX.[]What do you want to talk about?
Dialogue||Feel free not to answer, but do you ever feel held back by your title?
Dialogue||You always seem so in control. How do you do it?
Dialogue||I don't mind, XX. In some ways, being Archmage is indeed a restriction. I do everything as a representative of our town, so I have to be careful.[]But the satisfaction I feel from guiding Sun Haven forward outweighs all else. It's a sacrifice I would make again and again.
Dialogue||In part, it's due to my training. I had to practice clearing my mind to control my magic. That same trick keeps me from losing my composure.
Dialogue||We're lucky to have you, Lucia.
Dialogue||Don't you think you're neglecting yourself?
Dialogue||I would do anything for my people. That means you, XX.
Dialogue||I really don't see it that way at all. Perhaps we simply see things differently, XX.
Dialogue||Have your feelings ever gotten away from you?
Dialogue||I never considered that side of your training before.
Dialogue||Oh, yes... once as a teenager, I got into a shouting match with Catherine about who-knows-what.[]We were both hard headed and adept with magic, a bad combination for teenagers... I ended up burning her hair off by accident.[]But that's in the past! We haven't fought even once since then. We were only foolish kids at the time.
Dialogue||Naturally, it's not the first thing that comes to mind when you hear "fire magic," but that was actually where Grandfather's training started - with simple meditation.
Dialogue||I'm never too busy for you, XX. How are you doing today?																								
Dialogue||I ate too many spring rolls last night and had some strange dreams... Has that ever happened to you?																																																																																																																
Dialogue||The secrets of brewing go deeper and darker than you could imagine...																																																																						
Dialogue||XX! You're looking healthy. Er, I mean you look good. Healthy-good.
Dialogue||Liam, what do you have in your hands there?
Dialogue||So, what would you say if I asked you on a date?
Dialogue||Oh, these! Yeah let me explain, see... well, they're a gift. Um, for you.[]I know used oven mitts aren't the best gift ever, but I've used these mitts for years.[]They've been with me through all the chaos of moving here, taking care of my sisters, and running the bakery.
Dialogue||Oh wow, I don't know, I mean... I guess it depends.[]Er, sorry. You caught me off guard. Go ahead and ask again.
Dialogue||Sounds like they mean a lot to you.
Dialogue||So, why are they for me again?
Dialogue||They've been with me a long time. I want you to have them because I'm grateful for our friendship and... I want you to be with me a long time too, I guess... does that make any sense?[]Anyway... I'll stop talking now.
Dialogue||Gladly! Do you want to go out with me?
Dialogue||Actually, this might not be a good idea.
Dialogue||Oh! Well... Yes. I mean, definitely! Sorry, I'm not used to this kind of thing. So um, maybe... meet me in front of the bakery tomorrow at 5:00 pm? Yeah, that should work.
Dialogue||That's how you feel? Don't take this the wrong way, but that's a bit of a relief.[]Not that dating you would be a bad thing! I just have a lot going on right now.
Dialogue||I never was attracted to anyone in my village. You're something special, XX.																																																																																														
Dialogue||Hey, XX! Is it just me, or does the whole town feel more lively these days?
Dialogue||It's not just you, I feel it too.
Dialogue||Maybe it's because you've kept everyone so healthy!
Dialogue||I don't want to get my hopes up, but it really feels like Sun Haven has survived the worst of it. 
Dialogue||Haha, that's nice XX but I don't think so. I think we've been getting more travelers through town. I've seen some unfamiliar faces here and there.
Dialogue||This town really is unlike any other.
Dialogue||I wouldn't say Sun Haven's recovered just yet.
Dialogue||You're right. Even down south I couldn't find a community as close as this one. I really believe that's the reason Sun Haven has survived - commonwealth.
Dialogue||Well sure, there's still some way to go. But you can't say we're not better off now than we were a few weeks ago.[]It's about being optimistic, XX. You might give it a try.
Dialogue||Do you like when new people come through?
Dialogue||Have you had any trouble with travelers before?
Dialogue||Sure! It's always good to keep things new and interesting. Plus, many travelers like to get a check-up after a long journey. 
Dialogue||Not personally, although I did watch Mari kick a couple of young guys out of the tavern.[]You should have seen it - she dragged them out by the ears! Ronald didn't even notice until she had already slammed the door shut.
Dialogue||Hello hello, happy day XX! It's going to be a happy day because my animals told me so.
Dialogue||You can... talk to animals? 
Dialogue||What are you going to do on this happy day?
Dialogue||Huh? No, silly! Don't joke XX, I can just tell by their moods, nya.[]Today the chickens were bobbing their heads a lot and talking to each other. If the chickens are happy, then it's a happy day!
Dialogue||I was thinking of stretching in the sunshine... but then I remembered how Roza told me not to lay down on the paths, nyaaaan.
Dialogue||It's incredible how well you know those animals.
Dialogue||I don't know why you think that means they're happy.
Dialogue||It only takes time to get to know them, nya. You can do the same thing too, easy easy. Just spend time with animals on your farm and you'll see!
Dialogue||You don't understand the animals like I do, XX. I'm friends with all my animals, nya nya!
Dialogue||Why not lay on the grass?
Dialogue||Why not go for a run?
Dialogue||The grass doesn't get as warm as the paths do. I also like to rub my cheeks in the hard ground, teehee!
Dialogue||Or better yet - a chase! But who should I chase... Squirrel? Bird? Pod? Choices, choices, nya...
Dialogue||Is there anything better than hot coffee to wake you up?											
Dialogue||Sorry XX, I spilled stinkwort on my dress earlier. I know, it smells horrible.									
Dialogue||Hi hi!! Are we having a super duper day, nya?					
Dialogue||Don't forget, you're going to owe me anniversary presents for the rest of our lives!
Dialogue||Don't you mean "Anne"-iversaries?
Dialogue||I'm lucky you have such a wide range of tastes, then!
Dialogue||Very cute, XX. No, really, that's actually a very cute joke![]But for the record, I don't accept jokes for gifts.
Dialogue||Don't be so quick, XX. I appreciate a variety of items, but they're all linked by one virtue - worth.
Dialogue||Yes, dear...
Dialogue||You'll change your mind when you hear my <i>good</i> jokes.
Dialogue||Oh, don't pout like a child - that makes me feel bad! It's not like I'm sending you to your room, for goodness sake.
Dialogue||I somehow doubt that, XX... But feel free to try!
Dialogue||So, expensive tastes then. Got it!
Dialogue||What about homemade gifts?
Dialogue||To put it bluntly... but that's part of why I love you, isn't it? 
Dialogue||Only if you're an expert jeweler, XX. Are you an expert jeweler? I didn't think so. 
Dialogue||Do you bug everyone that walks by or am I special?																													
Dialogue||I watch Liam bake at home at night time. He calls it "prepping" but I don't know what that is.							
Dialogue||Come take a look at my merchandise. You might spy something you like!
Dialogue||Breathing in fresh air, working on my craft, and spending time with the family... This is what life is all about.						
Dialogue||I work closely with the Archmage. Think of me as her sword.
Dialogue||My dear XX, I hope you're enjoying your day. I see you're already building a sweat!
Dialogue||... Am I really sweaty?
Dialogue||I hope your day is going well, too!
Dialogue||Oh! Sorry XX, I didn't mean to make you self-conscious.[]Anyway, I like it! It lets me know that you've been busy.
Dialogue||Well, so far I stopped Emma and Elizabeth from fighting over a book they both wanted, then I picked up some trash around town, and now I'm talking to you![]You could say it's a pretty standard day for me.
Dialogue||I guess I don't mind it then!
Dialogue||I don't want to look like a mess in front of you, Jun.
Dialogue||Ah, good! It's important to get comfortable with this kind of thing. We're spending our lives together, and that means sharing <i>everything</i>.
Dialogue||XX, you need to get comfortable with this kind of thing. We're spending our lives together, you know. That means sharing <i>everything</i>.
Dialogue||Sometimes I forget how much you do in a day.
Dialogue||We need a "Jun Day" to celebrate how much you do for Sun Haven.
Dialogue||Look who's talking! I couldn't keep up with you in a day if I tried!
Dialogue||Hah! Can you imagine, little flags with my face on them?[]I don't think my ego is big enough for something like that, though. I would be so uncomfortable!
Dialogue||Acting as Sun Haven's leader takes considerable work. I imagine running a farm is the same way.
Dialogue||I know how you learned about magic, but how did you learn to lead a town?
Dialogue||This town is the product of your hard work.
Dialogue||When I first took the role, I learned by reading books. Diaries, actually, of Sun Haven's previous leaders.[]This town has generations of history passed through the hands of notable leaders. Their experiences were invaluable learning tools for me.
Dialogue||Thank you, but each and every citizen contributes to Sun Haven's growth. That's part of what makes Sun Haven beautiful.
Dialogue||That doesn't make you sound very qualified.
Dialogue||That's clever, no wonder you're so good at this!
Dialogue||Regardless of how it sounds, look around you. Sun Haven still stands. There is order here, at my command.[]I know I'm fulfilling my role. Furthermore, I trust my people to hold me accountable. I give you that same trust, XX.
Dialogue||Oh, nonsense. I credit my people - which includes you, of course! XX, as our only farmer, you're now a significant part of Sun Haven's community.
Dialogue||I hope I do my part!
Dialogue||True, but we all take after your example.
Dialogue||XX, of course you do. In fact, I suspect you do more than you realize.
Dialogue||XX, we should talk every day because I always seem to come away with lifted spirits. You have a truly kind soul!
Dialogue||AH! - Sorry XX, I saw a birdie.					
Dialogue||Sometimes I still can't believe you chose me!																																																		
Dialogue||All this doing nothing is making me hungry!													
Dialogue||I think you're the best thing to happen to Sun Haven in a long time, XX. You're certainly the best thing that's happened to me.																																																												
Dialogue||Hiiiii XX. Are you happy you moved to Sun Haven yet, nya?
Dialogue||Have you always lived in Sun Haven?
Dialogue||What's your favorite place in Sun Haven?
Dialogue||Almost my whole whole life, I have. It's my favorite place for sure!
Dialogue||I like all the birdies that stop by the bird bath outside of Catherine's house. But she asks me to leave them alone, nyan. I just can't help but swat at them, teehee.
Dialogue||Could you see yourself living anywhere else?
Dialogue||It seems like a lot of travelers end up staying in Sun Haven.
Dialogue||Maaaaybe the Great City, nya. But I've never seen the Great City before. It would be a Kitty adventure!
Dialogue||Sure sure, they know I'm here! Teehee, just kidding.
Dialogue||You shouldn't attack the poor birds.
Dialogue||I bet you could catch them easily!
Dialogue||I can't help it, they're so flappy! Besides, I'm not <i>really</i> attacking, just playing.
Dialogue||Oh yes, nya! But don't worry, I don't hurt the little cuties! 
Dialogue||You've had your powers for some time now, XX. How are you adjusting?
Dialogue||I think I'm pretty comfortable with my powers.
Dialogue||How long did it take you to adjust to your powers, Lucia?
Dialogue||Well, as one Blessed to another, I'm glad to hear that! You're going to develop into an incredibly powerful individual some day, XX. It's good to have you on our side!
Dialogue||Well you should remember that I was training my powers as a little girl. But maybe that's not quite what you meant.[]I'd say it took a year or two to finally adjust to actually having powers. To feel like they weren't just something to keep under control, and instead were truly part of me.
Dialogue||It's good to be on your side, too!
Dialogue||Well what if I... decided to switch sides?
Dialogue||With our powers put together, we'll secure the future of Sun Haven!
Dialogue||If that's your idea of a joke, I really don't appreciate it. You shouldn't joke about using your powers like that, XX.
Dialogue||You seem like such a natural, I'd have never guessed.
Dialogue||That long, huh?
Dialogue||Every skilled master started as an untested novice. That goes for anything![]What you see when you look at me is an accomplished Archmage. What you don't see are the years of self-doubt and struggling.
Dialogue||If you ever want to race, just let me know, nya!									 																																																																																																													
Dialogue||As the top strategist for King Minos, it's my job to secure Withergate's future.																																																																								
Dialogue||Emma got into a sack of flour this morning. The handprints she left all over the floor were real cute, but it was a mess!
Dialogue||Must have been a pain to clean the mess all on your own.
Dialogue||So does this mean everything you bake is going to have Emma germs in it?!
Dialogue||It might have been, but it wasn't really a big one. Besides, Emma helped clean it up! I can't get upset at her or anything, she's just a kid after all.[]I don't know if I would have it in me to ever be angry with either of my sisters, honestly.
Dialogue||Don't worry, XX, it was just one sack. I threw it all out after we cleaned up.[]I love Emma to death, but that doesn't mean everyone wants her dirty little fingers all over the flour that made their bread. Even if her little fingers are so cute! 
Dialogue||It's hard to be angry at cute little Emma.
Dialogue||She shouldn't be causing that kind of trouble.
Dialogue||Heh, yeah. We had a talk about staying out of the flour, and I think she'll behave now. She's a good kid, and I love her.
Dialogue||That's... true. Maybe I should be a little more strict with the girls, but it's so hard to get angry at them.
Dialogue||I'm just kidding, I know you wouldn't use that flour. 
Dialogue||Whew, that's a relief.
Dialogue||Ah, oh, right! Heh, sometimes I don't catch on to jokes like that. I gotta lighten up, right?
Dialogue||Don't worry, we practice good hygiene at this bakery. Our flour will always be Emma free!
Dialogue||Topi is my friend. Maybe even my best friend! No wait, that's mama.																																																																																																																																				
Dialogue||Liam is my brother!							
Dialogue||Hey there, uh, looking good there... champ.[]I'm sorry, flirting isn't my strong suit.																										
Dialogue||I'm telling you, XX - live in a cart. It's so much more affordable than a house!
Dialogue||By now, I think of Sun Haven as my home away from home.
Dialogue||You seem to really care about this town.
Dialogue||Have you heard rumors of a monster town?
Dialogue||I'm here to protect Sun Haven, so I have to care about it. Sometimes I even pretend to switch lives with people to try and understand them better.[]That might sound kooky, but it helps.
Dialogue||Withergate? Of course! Who hasn't?
Dialogue||That's a little weird.
Dialogue||That's really thoughtful.
Dialogue||Fine, call me a little weird then.
Dialogue||I think so too. Plus, it keeps me entertained! For the record, Solon's life is the most fun.
Dialogue||Are you worried? 
Dialogue||You don't sound worried. 
Dialogue||I guess I'm a little worried. Or maybe I'm just wary. Either way, I'm glad I have the training to deal with any possible attacks.
Dialogue||If I panic, then how can I expect the civilians to stay calm? I have to lead by example, just like Nathaniel says.
Dialogue||Kitty had a nightmare last night... I was climbing a tree all grown up, but I got stuck like I did as a kitten!
Dialogue||I'm sure you're strong enough to get back down, now!
Dialogue||Maybe Catherine can help you with those nightmares.
Dialogue||What if it's a warning that I shouldn't be climbing trees anymore? Oh that would make Kitty sad!
Dialogue||Like with magical herbs, nya? I don't like Catherine's potions too much. They taste so... yuck! Nasty.
Dialogue||Don't be sad, I'm sure you won't get stuck.
Dialogue||You'll be ok, but maybe you can climb shorter trees for now, just in case!
Dialogue||You're right, I'm a pretty good climber now, nya! So nice to have a sunny friend cheering me on. Thanks, XX!
Dialogue||You're right, nya! Gosh you're so clever, XX! 
Dialogue||You should just deal with it if you want to avoid the nightmares.
Dialogue||It's true... Maybe she could make one that tastes like berries?
Dialogue||Ugh, I'd rather have nightmares, nyan...
Dialogue||Oh! Or fish! I think I'll go ask her to try, nya. Good idea, XX!
Dialogue||I just came across an old critic's review of my first concerto. He called it "lacking in concrete inspiration."[]Heh, critics...
Dialogue||Do you agree with what the critic said?
Dialogue||How did you come across such an old review?
Dialogue||Not really. Maybe he was right, or maybe he was wrong. Either way, I don't really write my music for other people's enjoyment.
Dialogue||My concerto is famous through every region of the land. Hundreds of people wrote what they thought about it.[]Sometimes, when I'm really dwelling on the past, I'll go back see what people said about my concerto.
Dialogue||Who do you write your music for, then?
Dialogue||You don't care if people like your music?
Dialogue||I write my music for me, XX. I appreciate if other people enjoy it, but it's not necessary.[]I feel if I tried to make music specifically that other people would like, I'd just limit myself.
Dialogue||That's truly amazing, Claude!
Dialogue||That's an unhealthy obsession.
Dialogue||Yeah. Like I said, it was famous through every region. Some of them write that they love, it others write they they hate it.[]I don't mind much either way, but it's interesting they care enough about my music to hate it.
Dialogue||If there's one thing I'll never do, it's allow myself to be confined by the opinion of another. I can read all the old reviews I want.  
Dialogue||Hey there, XX. I could go for a good mango right about now.
Dialogue||Mango?
Dialogue||How's Charlie doing?
Dialogue||Oh, maybe you don't know. It's a type of fruit that grows all over the Southern Islands. I used to be able to eat them every day, if I wanted.
Dialogue||Oh, so you remembered my little pet mouse, huh? Heh, no one usually bothers to ask me about Charlie. He's doing just fine, actually. As far as mice go, at least.[]Most people consider mice to be a pest, but that's such a limited way of thinking! Charlie doesn't think of himself as a pest, you know.
Dialogue||What's the best replacement for a mango that Sun Haven's got?
Dialogue||Could I grow a mango?
Dialogue||Hrm, the best replacement for a mango? I guess apples come the closest, but they're not quite the same.
Dialogue||I'm not so sure of that. They only grow on trees in very warm climates. I've never seen a mango tree this far north, at least.
Dialogue||It's just a mouse, you could've gotten rid of it.
Dialogue||You're such a softie.
Dialogue||Nope. Not my style, XX. It was Charlie's house first, that's how it is. I don't need to explain myself more than that. Though I wonder, would Charlie like mango?
Dialogue||What can I say? Just because Charlie is a mouse doesn't mean he's less important than I am! Though I wonder, would Charlie like mango?
Dialogue||Nobody knows their way around a griddle like my Ronald.			 																																			
Dialogue||I'm the first of all my siblings to get married. They're all so jealous! Hehe.																																																																																														
Dialogue||Hello again, XX.
Dialogue||Wait, did you actually call me by my name?
Dialogue||I want to contribute to Withergate's prosperity, my prince. 
Dialogue||Don't push it. You're walking a razor-thin line right now. Make wise decisions.
Dialogue||Are you suggesting that Withergate needs the help of an outsider?
Dialogue||Does this mean I can call you Darius?
Dialogue||I'm honored, Prince Darius.
Dialogue||That's pushing it. You're still an outsider.
Dialogue||I'm glad that my investment in you hasn't been a complete waste of time.
Dialogue||Not at all, my prince. I only want to help if I can.
Dialogue||Everyone needs help, sometimes.
Dialogue||If you wish to join the higher levels of our society, you must learn not to degrade yourself like this.
Dialogue||Your Human town might call for aid when things get rough, but Withergate succeeds on its own. You have nothing to offer us.
Dialogue||I've been taking more walks like you said and it really helps. I'm more relaxed at home, which is a lot better for the girls.
Dialogue||How are your sisters doing?
Dialogue||Say, where is the rest of your family?
Dialogue||They're just fine, thanks! Both of them are responsible for their age, so I can leave them alone sometimes.[]If they needed a close eye on them like Pod does, then I don't know how I could do my job.
Dialogue||Ooh, sorry XX that's... a touchy subject. Um. Maybe I'll tell you sometime, but I don't want to get into it right now.
Dialogue||Are you sure you're giving them enough attention?
Dialogue||You've got some wonderful sisters, there.
Dialogue||Hm, I guess they might be a little overlooked sometimes. You don't think I'm being neglectful? Ah, maybe I should talk to them.
Dialogue||I know. Sometimes I forget that they're so young because they manage themselves so well. I could learn something from them, for sure.
Dialogue||You can share with me.
Dialogue||I can wait until you're ready to talk about it. 
Dialogue||Sorry, XX. Maybe someday.
Dialogue||You're a good friend, XX. I'm glad you're here.
Dialogue||Wow... I can't believe it! I just saw you and thought, "I'm MARRIED to this person!"
Dialogue||How does it feel?
Dialogue||Did you think you'd ever get married?
Dialogue||It's weird! It's weird, right? Or am I blowing this out of proportion? 
Dialogue||It definitely wasn't in the plan. Then again, I didn't really have a plan, either. So I guess if there never was a plan... at least it wasn't against the plan?
Dialogue||It's definitely weird.
Dialogue||I don't think it's weird at all.
Dialogue||I'm glad you think so, too. At least it's weird together, right? 
Dialogue||I guess it's different for someone like me. Settling down feels weird. That's what people call it, right? We're "settling down?"
Dialogue||I love your logic.
Dialogue||That makes no sense.
Dialogue||Hah, if you can call it that! It works for me, anyway. I've made some of my best decisions using flawed logic. Like marrying you! 
Dialogue||I know the logic is flawed, but at least try to stay with me here. 
Dialogue||Seeing all the different people in Sun Haven makes me wonder what Nel'Vari would be like if it were more open.
Dialogue||How open do you mean?
Dialogue||What made you think of that?
Dialogue||Nel'Vari could benefit from the diversity Sun Haven experiences every day. If our village weren't hidden so deep in the forest, we could host travelers like the Humans do.[]The Elven people could use an outside perspective. I don't see how we can progress as a society while never learning anything from the outside.
Dialogue||Speaking plainly, I think Sun Haven is everything a city should be. It has different people from every part of the world. I just wish I could live in a town like that.
Dialogue||A lot can be learned from traveling strangers.
Dialogue||Wouldn't that make you vulnerable to an attack?
Dialogue||That's exactly my point. Yes, Elves are masters of woodcraft and we have the World Dragon's wisdom behind us. I still think we Elves could be more.[]I really admire the Humans' natural desire to expand their perspective. If only Elves were the same way...
Dialogue||Ah, so you've heard about the ancient attacks that nearly destroyed all of Nel'Vari? The Elder uses that excuse to justify our secrecy.[]It's been hundreds of years since that attack. It's silly to keep hiding. XX, I hoped you would see through the Elder's lame excuses like I do.
Dialogue||You've learned things in Nel'Vari that most people never learn.
Dialogue||Every city has its interesting people. 
Dialogue||That's true, having Nivara around is a major advantage. Especially for the Blessed who have magic within them.[]Trying to get a handle on my magic without a dragon's guidance would have been nearly impossible. 
Dialogue||Hm, well you're not wrong. I suppose we have Rel'Tar, not to mention the World Dragon herself. Maybe I'm taking my home for granted.[]This was a good chat, XX.
Dialogue||Hey there, outsider. You look lost. The Human town is back where you came from!
Dialogue||So do you have any hobbies - other than antagonizing people, that is?
Dialogue||You know, I think I'm catching onto your act.
Dialogue||Trying to get to know me? I'll play along.[]Yeah, I like to challenge my brain since my body is perfect. Chess is my favorite game. Talk about strategy! I'm undefeated in Withergate - and that includes Darius. 
Dialogue||Oh, are you now? I'm really, really curious - what is it you think you've caught onto?
Dialogue||Have you beaten the Demon King?
Dialogue||I've never played before.
Dialogue||The Demon King is too busy to play games. Besides, the best strategy against the king is not to play him in the first place - that's a lose-lose.
Dialogue||Well then there's no point in playing against me. Maybe go practice for, oh, fifty years. Start against toddlers and work your way up. I'll be waiting at the top.
Dialogue||You're afraid to act nice because you fear rejection.
Dialogue||You like to push people's buttons to see who breaks and who doesn't.
Dialogue||That... is... HILARIOUS! You took your shot and missed by a mile, pal.
Dialogue||Well look at you, outsider. Of course I like pushing people's buttons - that's what buttons are for![]Heck, I'll admit, I'm surprised with you. The sewer rat has a brain after all!
Dialogue||You've made me happy in a whole new way, XX.																																																																				
Dialogue||You? I suppose we were never properly introduced...  
Dialogue||Right. So, I'm XX.
Dialogue||My name is Cordelia. I sit on the royal council with Xyla and Darius. I would say it's a pleasure...
Dialogue||You've been here a while now. Do you like Nel'Vari, XX?[]Sometimes I wish it was different, but I'm not sure how.
Dialogue||If you could live somewhere else, where would you want to live?
Dialogue||Life in Nel'Vari seems so peaceful, but do you ever get bored?
Dialogue||I've heard that the Southern Islands are lush with exotic plants, which sounds amazing. I don't think I'd leave Nel'Vari for it, but it's a fun thought.
Dialogue||Personally, I don't get bored. I keep busy with enchanting and the occasional woodworking.[]I know Vaan gets bored though. That guy spends more time outside of Nel'Vari than inside, it seems like.
Dialogue||What WOULD you leave Nel'Vari for?
Dialogue||What would you do if you lived there?
Dialogue||I'm not quite sure. There's never been a reason to leave, so I haven't.[]I guess I just need a good reason. But it would have to be a really good one!
Dialogue||More of the same, probably. Enchanting, experimenting, some woodwork. Ooh, I bet my experiments would look completely different!
Dialogue||You're incredibly devoted to your profession, Iris.
Dialogue||You should be more like Vaan.
Dialogue||What's that Human saying? "Practice makes it perfect?" Something like that.[]Anyway, I'm proud of my skills so practicing a lot keeps me happy.
Dialogue||Hm, I don't think so. He spends a lot of time around other people. I need more time to myself.
Dialogue||I'm only telling you this because I trust you... I think Nathaniel's hair is covering a bald spot. Shh, don't say anything!
Dialogue||You're looking stronger and stronger every time I see you, XX. I guess that's because of your farm work, huh?
Dialogue||I hope you get to see my farm one day.
Dialogue||I'd really like to go out with you again, Iris.
Dialogue||I would like that, XX. It will just take a little time, is all. I hope you'll be patient with me.
Dialogue||I was just thinking, it's about time for our second date.
Dialogue||Sometimes you just need to take a chance.
Dialogue||Take all the time you need, Iris.
Dialogue||Sometimes... maybe. But this doesn't feel like one of those times.
Dialogue||Thanks, XX. I knew I could count on you.
Dialogue||Perfect!
Dialogue||Actually, I'll have to pass on this one.
Dialogue||Let's meet at my house at 5:00 pm tomorrow. I'm excited to see you there!
Dialogue||Oh, okay. I'm sorry, I guess I just thought... Well, nevermind. 
Dialogue||Lookin' for love, or just lovin' to look?										
Dialogue||How's my favorite farmer doing today?																		
Dialogue||Sewer rat! Aw, you crawled out of a sewer and into my heart. How gross!																											
Dialogue||Visiting with a dear friend is as important as any city council work.																																																																																																													
Dialogue||Enchanting with this wedding ring on my finger has been a new experience. Nivara tells me wearing it will make enchanting more difficult, but I don't want to take it off!
Dialogue||Why would a ring make enchanting harder?
Dialogue||Is the ring really that important to you?
Dialogue||When I enchant living things, the non-living material of the ring somewhat disrupts the flow of magic through my fingers as I work.[]It really isn't much, and besides, I love keeping it on even while I'm working.
Dialogue||Of course it is, XX. It's a symbol of our love, and of the beginning of our life together. Enchanting, at a basic level, is about combining the elements of different things.[]This ring is like an enchantment, the combination of you and I.
Dialogue||Won't your work suffer?
Dialogue||I don't mind if you have to take it off for your work.
Dialogue||Have some faith in your wife, XX. It'll take more than one little ring to get in the way of my enchanting. Even if that "one little ring" is the most important ring in my life.
Dialogue||That's so sweet, Iris.
Dialogue||It's just a ring.
Dialogue||Maybe it's sweet, but it's also true. We're an enchantment together, and this ring is what proves it!
Dialogue||Maybe to you it's just a ring. It means a lot more to me, though. 
Dialogue||I hope you're planning to stay. We don't need vacationers, we need citizens.																																																																			
Dialogue||XX, I'm glad you're here. My mind could use a distraction.
Dialogue||Why not head to the carnival if you need a distraction?
Dialogue||Darius, as the prince of Withergate... are you dating anyone?
Dialogue||Because I have no capacity for childish games... but, at least the citizens enjoy it.[]Xyla suggested it would raise spirits here. Monsterfolk are a downtrodden people, so my father made the call.[]In actuality, I would prefer to have barracks and barracks of fighters to protect our city. Maybe we will, one day.
Dialogue||Oh? Heh, that caught me off guard. I never know what to expect from you, XX.[]In fact, I have no romantic involvement right now. I'm very much open to the idea, though.
Dialogue||Increasing your strength is always a good idea.
Dialogue||Security is important, but so is having fun.
Dialogue||Certainly. It would secure the future of my family, as well as all monsterfolk. Your support is more than welcome.
Dialogue||Of course you think so. You're still an outsider, completely ignorant of my people's history.
Dialogue||I'm surprised you don't already have someone at your side.
Dialogue||I'm sure you will find someone soon!
Dialogue||My father has tried to arrange my relationships before, but that never ended well. I much prefer to make those decisions on my own.
Dialogue||Oh? Do you know something I don't? I'm keeping my eye on you, XX.
Dialogue||Eh? New to these docks, ain't ya? I never seen you before, at least.
Dialogue||I'm Sun Haven's new farmer, XX. Nice to meet you.
Dialogue||Ah, farmer is it? Good to meet you, too. I'm Rupert, and I fish. You can fish, too. Plenty of fish to go around, but you won't catch near as many as me, eheh.
Dialogue||I'm bored in school. I never know what Mister Jun is saying.
Dialogue||I was in school once, too.
Dialogue||You should tell that to Mr. Jun.
Dialogue||You were? Did you like it?
Dialogue||No way, that's a trick!
Dialogue||I loved it! 
Dialogue||I didn't like it either. 
Dialogue||Nuh-uh, I don't believe you. School is boring. You're not boring, though.
Dialogue||School is boring. You're not boring, though. I wish I could go to the farm instead of school.
Dialogue||Mr. Jun wouldn't trick you.
Dialogue||You won't get help unless you ask, Pod.
Dialogue||That's true. Mister Jun is a good friend!
Dialogue||No! You can't tell me what to do!
Dialogue||Demons and ghosts are normal around here, but someone from Sun Haven? That's new! I'm Donovan, by the way.
Dialogue||Hey Donovan, I'm XX. Wait, how can you tell that I'm from Sun Haven?
Dialogue||It's written all over your face. See, on your forehead right there, it says "Kick me, I'm from Sun Haven."[]Just messing with you, XX! I saw you come in from the sewer entrance. That only goes to Sun Haven, so it wasn't hard to figure out.
Dialogue||You wanna hear something weird? I haven't felt bored in... well, the longest time ever!
Dialogue||What have you been doing to keep from getting bored?
Dialogue||Why is that so weird, anyway?
Dialogue||I can't really explain it, but I haven't been doing anything different at all. Even if I'm at home alone for a few hours, I'm just... relaxed?[]Ugh, I'm starting to bore myself now.
Dialogue||I always thought boredom was like failing yourself. I mean, if I can't even keep <i>myself</i> interested then how am I supposed to be interesting to other people?
Dialogue||You're becoming a boring person!
Dialogue||Maybe you're just more content now.
Dialogue||No way! I would sniff the Moon Dragon's <i>butt</i> before I let that happen!
Dialogue||Content, huh? Eh, I guess. Sounds a little too similar to "boring" but maybe it's not as bad.[]Who knows? This could be a turning point for me! 
Dialogue||You're always interesting to me, Donovan.
Dialogue||You worry too much about how other people see you.
Dialogue||You've got a point. If I can keep you interested, then who cares about anyone else?[]Oh, except Arianella. I need her to like me so she'll teach me how to sew. I tear holes in a lot of my clothes... 
Dialogue||For once, you don't smell like dirt or sewer water! Don't tell me you actually took a bath for me?
Dialogue||I would never bathe for you, Xyla.
Dialogue||Do I really smell different?
Dialogue||Aw, you mean it? That's the sweetest thing I've ever heard![]Never change, XX. I want you just the way you are, body odor and all.
Dialogue||Kind of... wait, that might actually be some food cooking somewhere.[]It's too bad you can't smell like pizza all the time. I guess you're not the perfect partner after all...
Dialogue||I could say the same to you, Xyla.
Dialogue||You stink pretty bad too!
Dialogue||Hehe, oh XX... yep, we're a perfect match. It's an undeniable fact at this point. Nobody keeps up with me like you do!
Dialogue||I think you've lost the nuance in your jokes, XX. You're starting to just sound... annoying.
Dialogue||If that's my only problem, I'd say I'm doing pretty well!
Dialogue||I'll try to smell like pizza for you.
Dialogue||Yeah, yeah, don't get a big head. As far as I'm concerned, I can live without the smell of pizza. It woudl just be nice, is all...
Dialogue||And just like that, I swoon![]... I don't actually know what it means to "swoon" but you get the point.
Dialogue||I hear the legendary blacksmith Solon lives here. I wonder if he'd be willing to barter.															
Dialogue||The people in Sun Haven live each day with such beautiful consistency. They go to their jobs, tend to their children, care for their animals... every day, just like clockwork.																																																																									
Dialogue||Welcome, friend. Call me Scott. I'll supply whatever weaponry you need - or want!
Dialogue||I'm XX, good to meet you.
Dialogue||Like I said, XX. If you find yourself outmatched on the battlefield, come find me.
Dialogue||I don't know why, but my thoughts are pretty scattered today. Maybe I'm working too much.
Dialogue||Here's a question to get your mind off things - what's your favorite holiday?
Dialogue||Do you ever take a day off for yourself?
Dialogue||Oh man, so many holidays... I really like the Lantern Festival. Everyone gets together to celebrate the union between people and dragons.
Dialogue||A whole day off for myself, what a concept. I don't think I've had a day like that since... well, since I moved here with my sisters.
Dialogue||What do you like about it?
Dialogue||Sounds fun! What do you do to celebrate?
Dialogue||We get together as group to send floating lanterns into the sky. I think there's something symbolic about it, but I don't really remember... It's a nice time, though.[]I like it because we're all celebrating the same thing. I don't feel out of place because I'm just another local.[]Man, I'm rambling and I don't even know if I'm making sense.
Dialogue||It sounds like you don't know how to take care of yourself.
Dialogue||Your sisters are lucky to have a hard-working brother taking care of them.
Dialogue||Ugh, I know. I just don't know how I can make time for myself with everything else on my plate. Maybe I'm doing something wrong.
Dialogue||Thanks for saying so. People don't understand what it's like raising them on my own AND working at the same time.
Dialogue||So is it love at first sight? I mean, with Sun Haven?
Dialogue||You've been here a while, right Jun? Do you still like it here?
Dialogue||Did you move here like me?
Dialogue||Of course, Sun Haven is great. I just wish it was doing better. The people here have a strong will, though, so I'm optimistic.[]The trick is not losing hope, and if anyone does lose hope then that's where I come in.
Dialogue||Not at all, I was born and raised here in Sun Haven. I've never even visited the Great City. My little house has been my only home all my life.
Dialogue||I think Sun Haven will bounce back!
Dialogue||How do you stay so positive?
Dialogue||That's exactly the positivity I'm talking about! I already knew you were a positive person, but it's nice hearing you talk like that.
Dialogue||I take care of myself. For me that means taking an inventory of my worries or fears and writing them down. Maybe it's not for everybody, but that's my process.
Dialogue||There's no reason to move if you're happy.
Dialogue||Living in one house your whole life sounds terribly boring.
Dialogue||Oh, absolutely. Hey, feel free to come visit me whenever you want! You know, so you can see my home. My house is just above Liam's. He's a great neighbor, too.
Dialogue||It's good to know you think I'm boring!
Dialogue||You know, I really wish you could meet my family. My father would love you.
Dialogue||Maybe I will, one day.
Dialogue||You look a little far away. What's up?
Dialogue||Oh wow, I was just speaking my thoughts. But the idea of visiting home with you sounds so fun![]I could show you the gorge, and my all my friends, and if we timed it right we could even catch the smithing festival!
Dialogue||Some days, like today, I get a little homesick. When I feel like this, I like to make myself a meal that I would have had back in my village.
Dialogue||Whoa - slow down!
Dialogue||I would love to see where you came from.
Dialogue||Oh? I didn't realize I was getting so carried away. Sorry if that made you uncomfortable.
Dialogue||Let's try to make it happen one day. And then I can visit the Great City with you. I've never seen a city like that before.[]I love making plans with you like this! Just think of all the fun we'll have together.
Dialogue||Does that help?
Dialogue||What kind of food do you make?
Dialogue||Oh yes, it definitely does. I also write letters to my family.[]That reminds me, I still have a few letters to send off. Thank goodness Sun Haven has a post office.
Dialogue||I can make all of the best eastern dishes from my village! My favorite is pickled veggie salad, but sometimes I will go all out with a creamy beef stew.
Dialogue||I have lots of free time today, nya! Stop and talk with Kitty, yeah?
Dialogue||What would you do on your perfect day off?
Dialogue||Who do you like to hang out with in your free time?
Dialogue||<i>Purrfect,</i> you say? I would spend the day like I used to when I was a kitten, nya nya - running around with my friends, climbing trees and chasing squirrels!
Dialogue||Lynn is really the best, nya! She lets me keep talking forever and ever. I don't know anyone else that does that for Kitty.
Dialogue||That sounds kind of tiring.
Dialogue||... What do you do with squirrels when you catch them?
Dialogue||It's hard for me to get tired - I have lots and lots of energy! Can't you tell?  
Dialogue||Teehee, oh, XX. I let them go, silly! Sometimes I'll sneak a little kiss on their cute little heads, but that's all!
Dialogue||Lynn is nice like that - I'm glad you're friends!
Dialogue||I think Lynn is just too nice to interrupt...
Dialogue||Yeah! She doesn't even interrupt me when I go on forever about things. She's a good good listener, nya!
Dialogue||Well... Still, she never does interrupt, at least. Either way, I like her.
Dialogue||First I was blessed, then I became Archmage, and now I'm married... More and more, it seems like my fate is simply tied to Sun Haven.
Dialogue||It's a good thing you like it here!
Dialogue||Do you really believe in fate?
Dialogue||XX, that is being deceptively modest. I wouldn't say I simply like it here - Sun Haven will forever be my home. I am in love with this place!
Dialogue||I certainly do, XX. It's important for a leader to believe in a grand purpose. Otherwise, why should she bother leading in the first place?
Dialogue||It has been good to you, huh?
Dialogue||You have a lot of memories here.
Dialogue||To be completely candid, I meant it when I said my fate is tied to this town. I truly believe that, were I to leave Sun Haven, then I would be leaving behind all the goodness in my life.
Dialogue||Leadership gets you power.
Dialogue||That's a thoughtful point, Lucia.
Dialogue||Any person who craves power merely for the sake of being powerful is weak in the mind.
Dialogue||Thank you, dear XX. Without purpose, we would all be like sparks in the air - aimless, and quick to burn out.
Dialogue||Most people would have given up on this city right away, but not you. That's how I knew you were an adventurer.																																													
Dialogue||I was running through the forest when I found a bag of money! 																																																																																																													
Dialogue||Oh! An unexpected face to find in Nel'Vari. So you managed to solve our puzzle?
Dialogue||That's right. My name is XX, from Sun Haven.
Dialogue||Ah, Sun Haven. Of course. I'm Vaan, and it's a true pleasure to meet you.
Dialogue||Hello again, nya![]What's up??
Dialogue||Did you say "nya?"
Dialogue||What do you do here, Kitty?
Dialogue||Nya, that's right! Haven't you met a cat like me before? Don't tell me I'm your first, nya? Oh my goodness, then what do you think of my ears??
Dialogue||I run the pet store! Are you surprised, nya??
Dialogue||They look very colorful.
Dialogue||They look fluffy and cute.
Dialogue||Nya?! You really mean it?! Just don't stare too long, okie?
Dialogue||You run the store all by yourself?
Dialogue||That makes a lot of sense!
Dialogue||Not alone, nya! I have help from Nim. And not only that, but I take care of all the animals in Sun Haven town! I even sell animals you could use on your farm.
Dialogue||Not only that, I take care of all the animals in Sun Haven town! I even sell animals you could use on your farm.
Dialogue||Ugh. Hello again, XX. I'm a bit busy right now, can you try and keep this quick?
Dialogue||Anything I could do to help?
Dialogue||Busier than usual?
Dialogue||Well let's see. Do you either know a team of sewer dredgers who are ready to pull a quadruple shift, or are you willing to put some heavy duty gloves on and do it yourself?[]No to both? I thought so.
Dialogue||Nothing gets past you, huh? Darius is alllllways going on about how 'busy' he is, but I'm the one doing all the <i>real</i> work!
Dialogue||Sometimes your job is hard to envy.
Dialogue||You sure do have a lot of stuff to do.
Dialogue||Hate to say I agree, but I agree. Still, I'm Withergate's architect and a member of King Minos's royal council. My job <i>should</i> be hard to envy.
Dialogue||Darius is the prince, you shouldn't criticize him like that.
Dialogue||I think most people know who really does all the heavy lifting.
Dialogue||Oh yes, XX. Thank you for the reminder. Trust me, I didn't need it.
Dialogue||I try looking at it that way, too. In a way, such subtle recognition is its own flavor of reward.[]But sometimes I just want a taste of the not-so-subtle recognition, ya know?
Dialogue||You're back... How do you do?
Dialogue||Your glow is really pretty.
Dialogue||Caspera, how long have you been in Withergate?
Dialogue||Oh, do you think? That's a nice thing to say... You're a nice person, aren't you?
Dialogue||I don't know... The last thing I remember, I was visiting the castle... and now there's a whole city here.
Dialogue||It depends who's asking.
Dialogue||I hope so!
Dialogue||Who? Why, I can't remember...
Dialogue||Oh yes, nice indeed. If you need some company, you're welcome to speak with me... anytime.
Dialogue||You don't remember anything else? 
Dialogue||I don't think I understand. 
Dialogue||Well, I was playing on the bridge to the castle... I remember that I fell, and it was so warm. Then I woke up like this... and that's it.
Dialogue||There's no reason for us to be friends, far as I can tell. So quit trying!											
Dialogue||XX, I... forgot what I was going to ask. Never mind, ignore me!
Dialogue||Some people get real poetic about their fishin'. For me, it's just rod in the water, pullin' up a catch. Don't need to be more than that, I think.									
Dialogue||Once I perfect my ale recipe, I can return home as a hero! Or a celebrity, at least.																																																																					
Dialogue||I hope it rains soon.																																																																			
Dialogue||I'll never forget the day you stepped off of that train.																																																				
Dialogue||Withergate grows ever darker with you in its presence.									 									
Dialogue||Seeing your face every day makes me think I must be the luckiest man alive.
Dialogue||If you were the luckiest man alive, you would also be rich.
Dialogue||You think you're lucky? You're dating a farmer - I'm dating a doctor!
Dialogue||I am rich - in love and affection! Heheh.
Dialogue||XX, you're every bit as important as I am in this town. We need a farmer exactly as much as we need a doctor![]Well, except for Albert. That guy needs a doctor <i>way</i> more than he needs a farmer...
Dialogue||Boooooo.
Dialogue||Nice one! 
Dialogue||I get it, my jokes are too good. No need to explain, it's obvious. You love my humor too much.
Dialogue||Just when I thought you couldn't be more perfect - you like bad jokes!
Dialogue||Are you making fun of a patient? Isn't that wrong?
Dialogue||Then this town is lucky to have us both.
Dialogue||Sorry XX, but I need to keep my sense of humor. It's my defense mechanism as a doctor.
Dialogue||Sun Haven really has changed my life in every way possible. I know it did the same for you too, XX. You're right, we're both lucky for lots of reasons.
Dialogue||I can't wait for the day we get a cannon. We were promised one a long time ago, but it never showed up.																	
Dialogue||I remember, one day I was feeding the fish in Nivara's pools when she told me I had great purpose. I'm still not sure what she meant by that.
Dialogue||Do <i>you</i> feel like you have great purpose?
Dialogue||Can't you ask her to explain?
Dialogue||I'm... not even sure what that means, to be honest. The Elder has purpose, but he's been leading us for generations.[]I'm still so young. It's hard to know what my purpose is supposed to be.
Dialogue||"The most important lessons are learned, not told."[]Yeah, that's Nivara. She loves to make you work for your wisdom...
Dialogue||I bet you'll figure it out without even trying.
Dialogue||If you're this confused, maybe Nivara was wrong.
Dialogue||You really believe that? Well... darn it, if you can then why can't I?[]I guess the first step is learning how to believe in myself. Ugh, I can already tell this will be fun... 
Dialogue||That's impossible! The World Dragon has never led me astray, not in enchanting and not in life. Her wisdom is absolute, XX. I'm... a little shocked you even said that.
Dialogue||That's pretty smart.
Dialogue||That seems unhelpful.
Dialogue||You think so? It drives me crazy... Not to sound ungrateful, but sometimes I just want a direct answer.
Dialogue||I agree. But at the same time, I understand her point. It's a little annoying that she's always right.
Dialogue||Hm, you must be the new farmer. I'm Claude.
Dialogue||I'm XX. Good to meet you!
Dialogue||Sure thing. Er, you too.
Dialogue||How goes it, XX. Have anything to report?
Dialogue||Drop and give me twenty!
Dialogue||Fine looking sword you have. Are you any good with it?
Dialogue||Argh![]Jeez, XX. You just took me right back to my days as a trainee grunt... I almost fell to the ground out of instinct! Whew, at least was only you pulling me leg.
Dialogue||First of all, thanks for noticing the sword! It's actually my mother's old army sword. The military decommissions weapons after so long, but she took great care of this one.[]To answer your question, I'm pretty good with every type of melee weapon. Not a big fan of the crossbow, though. Never cared for fighting at a distance.
Dialogue||I was only having a bit of fun.
Dialogue||I don't think I've ever seen you flustered like that.
Dialogue||I know, I know. But my heart jump right into my throat for a second! Thanks for waking me up, at least, heh.
Dialogue||Yeah yeah, 'big, stoic Nathaniel', scared of some old drill instructor memories. But my heart jump right into my throat for a second! Thanks for waking me up, at least, heh.
Dialogue||Shouldn't a captain of the guard be handy with any weapon?
Dialogue||Hey, focus on what you're good at, right?
Dialogue||Well, thanks for the concern, XX. I can handle crossbows just fine, they're just not my preferred weapon. I hope my preference is alright with you.
Dialogue||In reality I'm passable with a crossbow, thanks to plenty of 'enriching' training. I'm just more up-close-and-personal with my fighting, I guess.
Dialogue||I wrote a bit of music the other day, my muse. I'm not sure if it's very good, but strangely I'm not concerned with its quality. It was simply fun to compose.
Dialogue||Composing music for <i>fun</i>?!
Dialogue||I'm happy you're starting to enjoy life more.
Dialogue||Heheh, is it really that crazy a thought for me? I just feel so elated these days, it's as if I'm finding new joy in everything, including my music.[]You wouldn't happen to know why that is, would you, my muse? 
Dialogue||I owe that to you, my muse. Without you in my life, all I'd see is the same mundane future ahead of me. I owe everything to you.
Dialogue||Nope. I couldn't tell you!
Dialogue||Hm. Did you start sleeping on a new pillow?
Dialogue||XX, I don't think I can ever put into words how happy I am with you. Perhaps I will have to express it through a new concerto. 
Dialogue||I'm always going to be here for you, Claude.
Dialogue||You shouldn't exaggerate like that.
Dialogue||I'm... so happy to hear that, XX. I love you. 
Dialogue||I didn't exaggerate anything, XX. You truly mean that much to me. Why don't you believe me?
Dialogue||Hey, farmer. You're looking a little ragged. You must be working hard already.
Dialogue||How do you keep from burning yourself out?
Dialogue||Who works the hardest between the soldiers?
Dialogue||I get adequate sleep and I eat right. The occasional cold shower clears my head when I'm feeling groggy, too.
Dialogue||If we're excluding me - which I assume we are - then I'd actually say it's Sophie.[]That girl has a fire inside her I haven't seen before. To be candid, I think she's trying to compete with me!
Dialogue||... That's it?
Dialogue||Good advice, thanks!
Dialogue||I see, you were hoping for a quick-fix, some kind of trick. Go talk to Lucia or Catherine if that's what you're after. I don't work magic.
Dialogue||I'm happy to help any way I can. That's the job, after all.
Dialogue||That's a good soldier!
Dialogue||You won't let her overtake you, right? 
Dialogue||Darn right that is! She's quickly becoming my favorite. Maybe I'll even take little Sophie under my wing.
Dialogue||If she works hard enough to surpass me, then she's earned it. We reward good effort in the Sun Haven Corps.[]... Not that she really stands a chance, anyway.
Dialogue||Hey XX, I think I overheard someone talking about us in the tavern last night.[]I hate when people talk behind my back...
Dialogue||Does it make you that uncomfortable?
Dialogue||You should do your best to ignore it.
Dialogue||Kind of, but it's not important. I guess I never thought I would be worth gossiping about again.[]But if you're asking whether I like the attention or not? Not really, that doesn't do anything for me.
Dialogue||I know, and I do try my best. Some things just get under my skin. I've got a sore history with gossip, is all.
Dialogue||No way, I think you love the attention!
Dialogue||I figured - you don't exactly love the spotlight.
Dialogue||Well, you're just plain wrong about me then.
Dialogue||Heh, I guess you've gotten to know me pretty well. I'm glad, XX.
Dialogue||You and I can gossip about everyone in town to get back at them. 
Dialogue||Who was it?
Dialogue||Heh, I don't think that will be necessary. Thank you for the laugh though, XX.
Dialogue||Oh, Calvin and some guards. I guess I shouldn't be surprised - Calvin is always talking about other people.
Dialogue||Today feels like a lazy day to me. How about you, XX?
Dialogue||If you're feeling lazy, I could cook for you. What's your favorite meal?
Dialogue||How do you pass the time on lazy days?
Dialogue||I can put a good dent in an everything-stuffed casserole, especially if it has extra carrots. And for dessert - apple cinnamon pie!
Dialogue||I love books of poetry. They remind me of spells.
Dialogue||I don't like pie.
Dialogue||Since you make potions, you must be a fantastic cook!
Dialogue||What! That can't be... XX, you have to try one from Liam's shop. They're to die for, I don't know how he does it. If I didn't know better, I'd think he was a witch, too.
Dialogue||Thanks for the vote of confidence, but... Unfortunately, I'm a terrible cook. Potions and salves are a piece of cake, but an actual piece of cake? I might as well not try.[]You have to try one from Liam's shop. They're to die for, I don't know how he does it. If I didn't know better, I'd think he was a witch, too.
Dialogue||Why do they remind you of spells?
Dialogue||Do you have a favorite poem?
Dialogue||There's power in words, you know. It's kind of the basis of witchcraft. If someone wrote a strong poem with a specific intent? That's essentially a spell.
Dialogue||I don't have one favorite, but there's a book of love poems in the library. It's kind of my guilty pleasure... I always find myself blushing by the end of it!
Dialogue||Hey XX! I'm short on time today so if you wanna talk, better make it snappy.
Dialogue||It's been a while since we hung out, just the two of us.
Dialogue||I never asked - what's the story with your tags?
Dialogue||Hey, you're right. I would totally meet up with you again!
Dialogue||You mean my necklace? No real story. I thought it would be funny to wear them. You know, since I'm half-dog. And... they're dog tags. See? Funny!
Dialogue||I'm going to go ahead and call this a date right away.
Dialogue||It's better if we don't.
Dialogue||Haha! XX, you're so weird. Sure, it's a date then. Meet me at the manhole by the apartment building by 12:00 tomorrow. I've already got ideas!
Dialogue||Suit yourself. I'll have more fun on my own, anyway.
Dialogue||I don't get it.
Dialogue||Hah! That is funny!
Dialogue||My jokes are wasted on the likes of you...
Dialogue||Finally, someone gets me!
Dialogue||Lynn has a lot of raw talent, but talent is worthless without discipline.						
Dialogue||Learn your place, outsider.
Dialogue||Work hard for me, okay? I'll be sure to work hard for you!																																																																																
Dialogue||The future may not be clear, but I think it's starting to look brighter everyday.																																																																																																																						
Dialogue||It's hard to balance thinking about enchanting and thinking about you, XX, but it's a fun little challenge.																														
Dialogue||Sorry, I can't talk for long. I'm going over city planning today at the town hall. It is... unexciting.							
Dialogue||The sun sure is bright here.																																		
Dialogue||Oh, hello there. I'm Sophie, glad to make your acquaintance.
Dialogue||Hi Sophie, I'm XX.
Dialogue||Ooh, you're the farmer. That must be nice, growing crops for a living.
Dialogue||I don't remember seeing you here before. You should go back home.												
Dialogue||My grains are germinating as we speak!																																																																						
Dialogue||Cynthia thinks she has Sun Haven's romance market in the palm of her hand. I love the girl, but she's going to see how a real merchant plays the game.																																																	
Dialogue||I hope Mister Jun has cookies tomorrow...							
Dialogue||Hi, I'm Billie! I just started working at the new salon. You should stop by!
Dialogue||I'm XX. It's nice to meet you.
Dialogue||You too, XX. I'm sure you're busy, so I won't keep you.
Dialogue||Oh, hello! Aren't you my train buddy? It's good to see a face that I actually recognize.
Dialogue||What do you do here, Lynn?
Dialogue||Where did you say you're from?
Dialogue||I'm a blacksmith. Or I guess, apprentice blacksmith. Solon is teaching me but I've only just started training with him. I hope to be as good as him, one day.
Dialogue||I'm from a little village in the east, so I'm still learning to live in a big city like this. It's a lot to take in.
Dialogue||Blacksmithing? That wouldn't have been my first guess.
Dialogue||I'm sure you'll become a master one day, too.
Dialogue||Everyone seems surprised when they hear that, but I don't see why. Many women in my old village work the forge. Is it really so odd?
Dialogue||Oh, well, thank you! I - I'm sorry, compliments always catch me by surprise. You're very nice, you know! 
Dialogue||If you think this is a big city, you're really clueless!
Dialogue||I'm adjusting, too. You'll get used to it in no time.
Dialogue||Oh. I'm really sorry, I didn't know... 
Dialogue||Thanks. For now I'm taking it slow and trying to explore a new part of Sun Haven every day. 
Dialogue||I am sure glad I ended up in Sun Haven. Watching you kids bringing this town together... it warms my heart.									
Dialogue||Hey, that cloud looks just like a croissant.																																																																																												
Dialogue||Emmett? No, I'm <i>Flemmett</i>.			
Dialogue||Don't be afraid to drop by for a visit sometime. My house is big enough for the two of us.																																																			 																																																										
Dialogue||Did you see something strange over there? Maybe I should check it out to be safe.																																																																																																							
Dialogue||Fancy meeting you out and about, XX. Or were you trying to find me? Hehe.																																										
Dialogue||The forest is fragrant today - can't you smell it?																												
Dialogue||Hello, XX. I'm pleased to see you integrating well in my city. Citizens like you will ensure Withergate's prolific future.
Dialogue||I'm curious to know your plans for Withergate's future.
Dialogue||You know, your people seem to regard you very highly.
Dialogue||My father has laid the groundwork for a successful city, but this is just the start. Withergate will expand into its own worldly region under the rule of King Darius.
Dialogue||Of course they do, my father and I have given them a quality of life unknown to monsters before Withergate. We forged the first monster community in the world, and it prospers.
Dialogue||Your father is an imposing ruler, but I look forward to seeing you take the throne.
Dialogue||That's good, Withergate could use some quality leadership.
Dialogue||As do I, outsider. With my family's legacy behind me, there is only fortune in my future. Maybe you will be there to see it, too.
Dialogue||You dare speak of my father like that? Do you crave punishment? Your opinion is lowly and worthless, just like you. If your words mattered one bit, I would have you locked away for such disrespect.
Dialogue||Withergate is the first monster community ever?
Dialogue||Where did monsters live before Withergate?
Dialogue||I hope you're just ignorant and not truly questioning me, for your sake. There's never been a city like this before now. Monsterfolk used to live only as exiles.[]Now, with a place for them to live freely, they are thriving more than ever.
Dialogue||Having another busy day, XX? That would make two of us!																																																																																						
Dialogue||XX, have you lost weight? I thought we were supposed to <i>gain</i> weight after we got married.
Dialogue||Is that good medical advice?
Dialogue||Are you worried about putting on a few pounds?
Dialogue||It's not really medical advice, but it's something I've noticed with married couples. Many of them gain a little weight after being married - I see it as a sign of happiness!
Dialogue||Ah! You noticed??[]I don't get as much exercise as you, XX, that's for sure. Maybe I should join Tonya on her morning runs...
Dialogue||I'm plenty happy, Wornhardt, even if I don't gain any weight.
Dialogue||We're not like other married couples.
Dialogue||Heh, well that's good to hear! Hm, maybe I should weigh myself at the hospital...
Dialogue||Heheh, is that what you think?[]I always thought of us as something special, too. I wonder if everyone feels this way?
Dialogue||That would probably be good for you.
Dialogue||Nonsense - you look good!
Dialogue||You know XX, there are gentler ways to tell somebody to lose weight.
Dialogue||Oh! Hah, well now that you mention it, I am a good weight for my height. But I'll keep an eye on it to be sure I stay healthy, of course!
Dialogue||*sniff* Don't worry, I'm not contagious. It's just allergies - this town is full of pollen.                                                									
Dialogue||Did I scratch you? Sorry! My claws are extra sharp right now, teehee!																																																																																											
Dialogue||Maybe we could go to the tavern one of these days!																		
Dialogue||Another sunny day in Sun Haven - what a surprise.																																								
Dialogue||Seeing you fills me with a sort of spark that I never thought I'd be able to capture.																										
Dialogue||It seems like a good day for farming. Not that I would really know.
Dialogue||It's good to see you out.
Dialogue||I hope your day ends on a good note, Claude!
Dialogue||Fresh air sometimes clears my head, but it isn't working today. I guess I don't mind seeing a familiar face on my walk, though.
Dialogue||That would be a first. Oh, wait... good "note." I get it. That's actually not a bad joke, XX.
Dialogue||What are you working on these days?
Dialogue||What's on your mind?
Dialogue||Oh, just a hopeless piano composition to revolutionize music as we know it... 
Dialogue||What joke?
Dialogue||I'll take that as a compliment!
Dialogue||Oh, I must have misunderstood. Like usual.
Dialogue||I don't mean to offend, it's just that most people aren't funny to me. Just, annoying. I'm surprised you aren't annoying me, that's all.
Dialogue||I heard you're running the farm across the river. That sounds like fun work!
Dialogue||Do you have fun as a guard?
Dialogue||What do you do when you're not in uniform?
Dialogue||I wouldn't quite say that. Don't get me wrong, it's not bad or anything. The work is more about protection than having fun.
Dialogue||I like to think of myself as an amateur inventor. I once used an old wagon wheel to make a machine that sharpens your sword for you. I love turning problems into projects!
Dialogue||Wouldn't you rather do something you enjoy?
Dialogue||Thank you for the work you do, even though it's not that fun.
Dialogue||You misunderstand me, farmer. I do enjoy this work, just not the same way that I enjoy... oh, I don't know - ice cream.
Dialogue||It's not always so serious. Plus, the rest of the soldiers are a ton of fun. It gets pretty rowdy in the barracks after hours!
Dialogue||What is your best invention?
Dialogue||That's so creative! 
Dialogue||Right now, my favorite is the scratcher I made. It's basically just a stick, but it's perfect for reaching any itch when you're wearing your armor.
Dialogue||A lot of the time I'm just bunked up in the barracks, so there's plenty of time to get creative. In a way, boredom breeds creativity.[]Giuseppe told me that! Have you met him yet?
Dialogue||I try my best to get away from the thought, but I can't shake that I'm past my peak.
Dialogue||What was your "peak"?
Dialogue||Why are you so worried?
Dialogue||My concerto, obviously. I wrote it when I was so much younger, the debut to my career as a composer.[]It was a swan song that came before birth, instead of before death. I feel like I'll never live up to it again.
Dialogue||If I've already hit the high point of my life as a composer, my peak, then I can't help but wonder if there's any point in composing anything else.[]I'm possibly only being dramatic, but I worry all the same.
Dialogue||If you keep composing, you'll get there again.
Dialogue||You'll never peak again if you keep being so sour.
Dialogue||You really think so, XX? It's hard to imagine, but your encouragement is very inspiring... Thanks. 
Dialogue||Every emotion I feel goes into my music, good or bad. It isn't for you to dictate like that. 
Dialogue||Your music is all great, don't overthink it so much. 
Dialogue||Would you just relax already?
Dialogue||I'm glad you think so, but this is a personal problem for me. Don't let it worry you, okay?
Dialogue||Oh, I guess I'm really bothering you with my problems. I truly didn't mean to. 
Dialogue||Yo, XX. Did I ever tell you about that time I stumbled across an entire yeti skeleton up in the north? I had bones for a whole week! Good times.
Dialogue||Aren't yetis also monsters? 
Dialogue||You... ate the bones?
Dialogue||You mean like, monsterfolk? Nah, not at all. They're wild beasts, but their bones sure are tasty. 
Dialogue||Well, I chewed 'em up pretty good. I mean, they were just laying there, ya know? I assumed it was a 'first come, first serve' kind of thing.[]Hey, if I see a bone, I'm going to chew a bone! I'd rather do what I want rather than miss out.
Dialogue||What makes a bone tasty?
Dialogue||What kind of bone is your favorite?
Dialogue||You know, I never thought about it before. I like yeti bones because they're nice and hard. Almost like rocks. So, maybe it's that?[]Bones taste better if they're more like rocks? I actually have no idea, now that I think about it.
Dialogue||Well... okay, I'll tell you this, but you can't tell anyone else, alright?[]Honestly, I love dragon bones! I've only had them a couple of times. Wild dragons, of course. But you know how everyone around here is with loving Dynus, and all.
Dialogue||You give into your instinct too easily.
Dialogue||Whatever. At least you had fun.
Dialogue||Just because I don't deny the part of me that's a wolf doesn't mean I "give into it." There's a difference, XX. You just gotta stop being so stuck up. 
Dialogue||And isn't that the important thing, XX? Make sure you make plenty of memories, and no regrets! 
Dialogue||I need to work with Xyla to increase security...																																																																			
Dialogue||Oh hey XX... Huh? Oh, hey XX...[]Sorry, I'm a bit sleepy. I found a job and barely got any rest yesterday.
Dialogue||A job? So you actually work?
Dialogue||You look really tired. What were you doing yesterday?
Dialogue||Work? I try not to! I just do odd jobs when they come up, and when I need money. And if some treasure happens to cross my path, you can bet I'll take it. A dog's gotta eat, you know.
Dialogue||I'm fine. I was just looking for griffon eggs is all. There's a man who sells them as pets, but someone robbed him of his nest. So, I went out looking for them.[]I couldn't find them, so I'm going to go back out there tomorrow. It's a shame what happened to this guy.
Dialogue||You just sound lazy.
Dialogue||Sounds like you have some real fun!
Dialogue||Just because I don't have a regular job doesn't mean I'm not active. Those Humans in Sun Haven are so focused on their jobs, it's unhealthy.
Dialogue||You're right about that. Hey, I'll take you out sometime - we would have a blast!
Dialogue||Can I help?
Dialogue||That's horrible!
Dialogue||Sure, if you're up for it. I tracked the thief to the southern part of town, but I lost the scent. Come find me if you get the eggs back!
Dialogue||Yeah, there are some scummy people in this city. Not many, but a few. I'm glad you seem to be one of the good ones.
Dialogue||It doesn't feel like a proper day without seeing you.																																							
Dialogue||Looking for a running partner? Let me know if you're interested!																																																																																																																																																						
Dialogue||Is it boring working on a farm? It must be more fun than standing in one spot all day.
Dialogue||You're the most bored person I've ever met.
Dialogue||Running a farm is a lot of work.
Dialogue||Oh yeah? That's kind of a compliment. Kind of.
Dialogue||I'm up for a challenge. What do you say, need a farmhand?
Dialogue||I don't see how it's a compliment.
Dialogue||You're a strange one, Calvin.
Dialogue||Well I've never been the "most" anything before. At this point, I'll take what I can get.
Dialogue||Strange times make strange people. Isn't that the saying?
Dialogue||I'll let you know if I do.
Dialogue||Definitely not.
Dialogue||Really? I was just joking, but if you offered me a job I might actually be tempted to take it.
Dialogue||You could just say "no."
Dialogue||Come on by if you need some armor or weapons - nobody makes 'em like I do.						
Dialogue||Some of my colleagues wish they could go home already, but I'm just glad I have a job.
Dialogue||I'm still working my way up the ladder. Roza's really whipping me into shape.											
Dialogue||I was thinking about getting a new jacket. What do you think? Yeah, better safe than sorry.
Dialogue||I wonder what other guardian dragons are like. Talking to a foreign dragon would be a valuable opportunity!																																																																																																																																
Dialogue||Hey again, outsider! You look boring as ever.
Dialogue||Well, what do you do that's so great?
Dialogue||You look... spiky. Why do you wear so many spikes?
Dialogue||You're kidding, right? I'm the architect - I built this place! Not only that, but I'm on the Demon King's royal council. Learn who you're talking to before throwing out a challenge, outsider.
Dialogue||That's what you've been wondering about me? Sheesh. You really know how to ask the hard-hitting questions. You should be a lawyer or something, really.
Dialogue||Okay, that's... pretty impressive.
Dialogue||So what?
Dialogue||Aw, you're so cute when you defer to your superiors!
Dialogue||You can act unimpressed all you want, but I know it's just an act.
Dialogue||I'm just curious!
Dialogue||Fine, don't tell me.
Dialogue||Listen, spikes look good and hurt people... Remind you of anyone... ?
Dialogue||Sometimes my job around here seems more administrative than militaristic.																																																																																														
Dialogue||You were probably fast asleep, but before daybreak this morning there was a fantastic fog blanketing the sky. So refreshing to fly through.
Dialogue||So you were up earlier than me, huh?
Dialogue||Don't you get cold when you fly?
Dialogue||Oh my, is the farmer feeling a little insecure? Not always the earliest to rise after all? I'm only joking with you.[]Yeah, sometimes I like to wake up really early and go on flights. Watching the whole world light up beneath me in real time is always so breathtaking. It's like a reverse sunrise, I guess.
Dialogue||Well, yeah. Sort of. Honestly I've learned that 'cold' is mostly a state of mind! I guess that's my inner-Elf talking, but I've learned to feel a connection to the chill.[]Like it doesn't bother me, it's just part of the experience. Which makes it part of me. Or does that sound a little silly?
Dialogue||Flying must be amazing.
Dialogue||Isn't there any downside to flying?
Dialogue||You can believe me when I say that it truly is. It is something about me that I will never relinquish. No matter what, who or why. 
Dialogue||No, not really. I mean, if there's <i>one</i> bad thing, it's when I hit a bug. You ever smack face-first into a gnat while flying full speed?[]Well, of course you haven't, but it feels like getting hit with a rock!
Dialogue||That's fascinating. So you're sort of cold-resistant?
Dialogue||Sounds kind of ridiculous.
Dialogue||Heh, I wouldn't say "resistant", more like "receptive". I'm receptive to the cold, because the cold is just part of the experience of flying.[]Thanks for trying to get on my wavelength, XX. You're alright.
Dialogue||Hm. I shared that piece of info with you because I thought you'd be understanding of it. Guess I was wrong.
Dialogue||You can always talk to me - don't forget that I'm also a counselor.																																				
Dialogue||My lovely XX, you're exactly who I need to see right now.
Dialogue||Rough day?
Dialogue||Just tiring. We're anticipating a shipment of supplies, so we have to take a full inventory of the barracks. It's exhausting.
Dialogue||I could use a pick-me-up. You always have something sweet to say!
Dialogue||Don't let a little counting ruin your day.
Dialogue||Don't work yourself too hard today.
Dialogue||I know, and I won't, but sometimes I have to put on a face for the other soldiers. Today is definitely one of those days.
Dialogue||I guess your hair looks nice today.
Dialogue||If I'm sweet, it's just because I've spent so much time with you.
Dialogue||That's not quite the sweetness I was hoping for, but I'll take what I can get I guess.
Dialogue||See that? That's <i>exactly</i> what I needed. XX, thank you for being so... you!
Dialogue||Sun Haven continues to be full of surprises... You, for instance!																		
Dialogue||XX! Hey, you look strong. I guess sailing isn't the only way to build real muscle, huh?
Dialogue||When did you learn to sail?
Dialogue||Okay, what's the story behind the spear?
Dialogue||I was born on the sea, so I like to say I started learning from day one.
Dialogue||Oh, this? It was a gift from an Elven village I found by accident.[]A storm forced me ashore on an uncharted island once. Uncharted islands are risky, so I didn't know what to expect I sure didn't expect Elves![]I promised not to reveal their location - you know how secretive Elves can be - and they gave me this as a parting gift. It's super sharp because it's made from coral!
Dialogue||You were born on a boat? 
Dialogue||But when did you really learn? 
Dialogue||Sure was. I don't think my mother ever forgave me for that... I'm not even joking!
Dialogue||I started early, can't be sure. Definitely when I was a kid, though. I might've been five? My little hands could barely hold a rope!
Dialogue||It's good of you not to reveal their location.
Dialogue||So... where was this island?
Dialogue||I guess so, but I don't know why I would even bother doing that. What's there for me to gain? An island of enemies? No thanks!
Dialogue||Nice try, XX. I'm a sailor, and sailors keep their word.
Dialogue||Hey, XX! Two words: Tree. Bark. Noodles. Well, okay, that's three words. But still, this is going to be big.																																																																																																																													
Dialogue||I'm not surprised you're back. It isn't every day you meet a master of his craft!
Dialogue||What exactly do you make again?
Dialogue||What brought you to Withergate?
Dialogue||I make beverages of all kinds: drinks, libations, quenchers, and potations too! I've dedicated my whole life to the perfection of brewcraft.
Dialogue||I thought this would be a good spot to sell my brews and maybe learn a thing or two about brewcraft. But to be honest, I was hesitant to come after all I heard about this city.[]I nearly turned around before entering Withergate because I wasn't sure what kind of people I would find here. Monsterfolk aren't my usual crowd - me being a regular house cat and all.
Dialogue||Are you working on anything special?
Dialogue||What is the best drink you've made?
Dialogue||But of course! I'm preparing an ale that will be nothing short of perfection. I can already taste it - bittersweet and refreshing...[]Nothing motivates me more than the thought of that first, crisp sip of golden ale!
Dialogue||The best drink is the one I've yet to make! I'm preparing an ale that will be nothing short of perfection. I can already taste it - bittersweet, crisp and refreshing...[]Every night I dream of that first sip of fizzy golden ale!
Dialogue||I'd say you fit in just fine here.
Dialogue||I don't know if I would call you a "regular" house cat.
Dialogue||You think so, do you? Well that's good, then! I don't want to seem unapproachable to the people here.
Dialogue||What in the world do you mean? Is it the goggles?
Dialogue||Just so you know, XX, I'd like it if you visited me more often.																				
Dialogue||Duty through service!											
Dialogue||Hey XX, is it true that you moved here from the Great City? I bet that place is amazing.
Dialogue||The Great City is nice, if you like cities.
Dialogue||Where are you from, Sophie?
Dialogue||I don't know if I like cities. I've only ever seen regular towns like this.
Dialogue||I came all the way from the north. Well, it was the southern part of the Northern Region, if you follow me.
Dialogue||You're not missing much.
Dialogue||You should try to travel more.
Dialogue||Do you really think that? Hm. I believe you, but I still want to see for myself one day.
Dialogue||That's actually part of what made me join the military, so I could travel more. I guess I didn't expect to be stationed in the same town for five years...
Dialogue||I've heard nice things about the north.
Dialogue||I've heard terrible things about the north.
Dialogue||Like with any place, the north has its good parts and its bad parts.[]I'm sure you've heard, but the weather is brutal. On the other hand, I never met someone on the road that was too busy to help when you need it.
Dialogue||Hm? Yes, may I help you?
Dialogue||I'm XX, the new farmer in town.
Dialogue||Oh, yes I suppose we haven't met. My name is Bernard. It's a pleasure.
Dialogue||I used to be a hero, too. Back in my golden days.						
Dialogue||Hey, XX. Don't mind me, I'm having one of those days.
Dialogue||So what's going on with you?
Dialogue||How about you take a nice walk today?
Dialogue||I completely forgot a customer's order today. They came by last night to place the order for this morning, and I guess I didn't write it down or something.[]I was making breakfast for the girls when they came in. Then I remembered it all at once and my heart just sank.
Dialogue||That might be the right idea. Walking makes me breathe. I mean, I'm always breathing. Everyone breathes. But walking breathing is different than regular breathing. You know?
Dialogue||You were taking care of your sisters first. That sounds right to me.
Dialogue||You dropped the ball.
Dialogue||I guess you're right. At least Emma and Elizabeth are taken care of. Sometimes I need a reminder about what's important. Thanks, XX.
Dialogue||I know. Sometimes the ball feels too heavy not to drop it.
Dialogue||I totally agree.
Dialogue||If it works for you, then do it.
Dialogue||Really? I thought I was babbling nonsense... Maybe I really will go take that walk.
Dialogue||You're right, XX. I think I'll go take my walk now.
Dialogue||Hey there. How've you been? I've been a little bored lately, myself.
Dialogue||Why have you been feeling bored?
Dialogue||You should pick up another hobby.
Dialogue||I suppose when I'm feeling uninspired, I get bored. I'm stuck with my music, and nothing is worse than a project half-realized. I either get it done, or I forget about it.
Dialogue||What do you mean "another" hobby, XX? Are you saying my music is a hobby? My music is my entire life, it's never been a hobby.
Dialogue||What do you do to find inspiration?
Dialogue||Your music must take a long time to compose.
Dialogue||Sometimes I listen to my records. If I knew how to make it come whenever I wanted, things would be a lot easier. But that's just not how it works.
Dialogue||It depends on how long I manage to stay inspired. If I knew how to make it come whenever I wanted, things would be a lot easier. But that's just not how it works.
Dialogue||Good point. Find a hobby!
Dialogue||I mean, it's really just a hobby.
Dialogue||A hobby, huh? I don't think I've ever tried to do anything other than music. But maybe it'll alleviate some of this infernal boredom. Something to think about, at least. Thanks.
Dialogue||It really isn't, XX. But why am I bothering to explain myself? I'll just go and suffer my boredom somewhere else.
Dialogue||I accidentally flew through a flock of birds yesterday. I think I was even more startled than them!
Dialogue||What is it like to fly?
Dialogue||Not so good with animals, huh?
Dialogue||So you actually are curious? I'm surprised you haven't asked already.[]Flying is the most freeing experience in the world. It changes how you think about everything - distance, nature, and even other people.
Dialogue||I wouldn't say I'm bad with animals, but I don't have a lot of experience. Maybe I should talk to Clemmett for advice.
Dialogue||Is it really that important?
Dialogue||How did it change the way you think?
Dialogue||Absolutely. One day, I'll show you so you can see. Standing in one spot, it's easy to miss the squirrels in the trees or the deer on the other side of the lake.[]You can see it all at once from above. That's when I realized that I'm just one small piece in a constantly changing picture.
Dialogue||I realized how active the world is. Standing in one spot, it's easy to miss the squirrels in the trees or the deer on the other side of the lake.[]You can see it all at once from above. That's when I realized that I'm just one small piece in a constantly changing picture.
Dialogue||You have an intense energy, working with animals might be hard for you.
Dialogue||You have a gentle spirit, you could figure it out if you tried.
Dialogue||I haven't even tried yet, but you think I'd fail? I was hoping for a little more support from my own partner.
Dialogue||Even when I doubt myself, you lift me up. You're truly the wind in my wings, XX.
Dialogue||Did you come by the bakery the other day? If you haven't you should come check it out.
Dialogue||How's the bakery doing, anyway?
Dialogue||Liam, what would be your fantasy baking project?
Dialogue||Business has actually been really good. Oh no, what if I just jinxed it? I take it back!
Dialogue||Wow, I haven't ever thought about that before... But, probably a wedding cake. A really really big one.
Dialogue||Well, I'm glad it's doing well. Even if you just jinxed it.
Dialogue||Are you doing anything different?
Dialogue||Just knowing that I can support myself and the girls is a weight off my mind.
Dialogue||That's the thing, I'm not. It's like the town itself is just getting a second wind. I don't get it, but I'm not about to question a good thing.
Dialogue||If I get married, I'm having you make the cake!
Dialogue||Do you really think you could handle something like that?
Dialogue||Really?? That's awesome, I'll start planning it![]Wait, no, nevermind. Too soon. It does sound fun though!
Dialogue||On second thought, I would probably screw it up and ruin the wedding.
Dialogue||I love everything about my position... except for the barracks.[]I would kill for my own living quarters!
Dialogue||Does Nathaniel get his own quarters?
Dialogue||What's your favorite meal that you can't get at the barracks?
Dialogue||Don't remind me. It's still in the barracks, but he gets a whole room to himself. Perks of being captain.
Dialogue||Hm, tough call. I'll say chicken salad because it's got everything my body needs.
Dialogue||You deserve those perks, too.
Dialogue||What's the army motto - "Duty through service?"
Dialogue||That's not a very military mindset, farmer. Once you start thinking things are unfair, you start to lose your nerve.[]You get what you earn, and I haven't earned it yet. But I will.
Dialogue||That's right, farmer. And a good reminder to me.[]I'll get my perks one day, but for now I have to do my duty.
Dialogue||Okay, but what about dessert?
Dialogue||Wow, you're even efficient when you eat.  
Dialogue||I don't eat it often but... I can't resist chocolate ice cream. It's simply the perfect dessert.
Dialogue||You say that like it's a bad thing.
Dialogue||You're looking energetic today - you must have slept well, huh?[]One of the first things I tell my clients is, good sleep is key to a healthy attitude!
Dialogue||What made you want to be a counselor to begin with?
Dialogue||So what are your tips for sleeping well at night?
Dialogue||I always get emotionally involved in people's stories, even when they have nothing to do with me. In part, I'm just a naturally good listener.[]That's also part of why I enjoy teaching so much... Oh, you didn't know that I'm also the teacher for the kids here?
Dialogue||I work hard every day to tire myself out. There's nothing like going to bed feeling adequately exhausted.[]But really, it's all about time management. Just keep an eye on your clock when it gets dark to make sure you don't stay up too late by mistake.
Dialogue||Do you really think you're making people happier? 
Dialogue||All your work is really shaping the future of Sun Haven!
Dialogue||Of course! Just having a friend to talk to can do wonders for your mental health.
Dialogue||I suppose you're right. I never thought of it that way, but that's actually a huge responsibility.
Dialogue||That's not much of a tip.
Dialogue||Thanks Jun, you're so helpful!
Dialogue||All I can do is tell you what works for me, XX. What you do with that is up to you.
Dialogue||I do get a strong satisfaction from helping out whenever I can. Heh, I guess it's kind of my pastime.
Dialogue||Sweet XX, what is on your mind? You look somewhat troubled.
Dialogue||I've been thinking about our future quite a bit.
Dialogue||Are you happy in our relationship?
Dialogue||In truth, so have I. It may be silly, but I haven't been able to think about my own future in a long while. At least, not without also thinking of Sun Haven.
Dialogue||XX, I'm surprised at you! Are you having doubts? Or is this my fault?[]If I've made you think that I'm unhappy with you, then you must know that I didn't intend it!
Dialogue||But now you can?
Dialogue||Do you see  afuture without Sun Haven?
Dialogue||Yes, I'm delighted when I think of the future here. Or as you put it, <i>our</i> future.[]I know that I will never leave Sun Haven, but it's nice to have something other than being Archmage to look forward to.
Dialogue||Oh, no no. I know that I will never leave Sun Haven. But it's still nice to have something other than being Archmage to look forward to in the future. Or as you put it, <i>our</i> future.
Dialogue||I can't tell if you're really happy.
Dialogue||But are you happy enough... to stay with me forever?
Dialogue||All I can do is tell you the truth, XX. It's your decision to believe it or not.
Dialogue||Oh my goodness... XX, are you asking if I'm ready for marriage??[]I can't think of anything that would make me happier, XX! When you think the time is right, I'll be waiting for you.
Dialogue||Sophie is always training, but she's already one of the most skilled guards in town.										
Dialogue||Sorry if I seem a little off. My aura is pinker than usual today.
Dialogue||Are you seeing anybody?
Dialogue||Catherine... I was hoping to ask you on a date.
Dialogue||Oh no, nothing romantic like that. I have plenty of friends, but just friends. I haven't had many romances in town, actually.
Dialogue||You were hoping to? Well... I hope you do too! Now would be a good time, if you're going to ask.
Dialogue||That's surprising to hear...
Dialogue||Well that's unsurprising.
Dialogue||Oh, surprising huh? XX, it almost sounds like you were hoping for that answer!
Dialogue||Oh, I didn't realize I was so undesirable to you. Good to know, XX.
Dialogue||Actually, I better not.
Dialogue||Let's go on a date together!
Dialogue||Oh, no? Well, all right XX. I'm just as happy to be your friend.
Dialogue||Oh my, what a surprise! Hehe, of course I'll go out with you XX! Meet me in front of my house tomorrow at 5:00 pm.
Dialogue||I heard a song from the record store and now it's stuck in my head, nyan...																																							
Dialogue||Hey XX! We're the talk of the town, have you heard?
Dialogue||What do you mean, talk of the town?
Dialogue||So do you still think of me as low-class?
Dialogue||Everyone knows we're together now. I'm a high-profile figure, you know. Don't get too worked up over it, rumors die as quickly as they're born.
Dialogue||Oh, definitely. Come on XX, just because you're dating me doesn't mean you're immediately part of the elite. You have to earn your way to the top!
Dialogue||Who cares? Let them talk.
Dialogue||I don't really like people talking about me.
Dialogue||That's exactly the right attitude. I thought you would never rise above your class, but maybe you have what it takes after all!
Dialogue||Aw, I didn't realize you were such a sensitive little baby! Just let it go, XX.
Dialogue||Maybe I don't want to be part of the "elite."
Dialogue||I'll get there one day!
Dialogue||That's what everyone says until they get their shot, then they always take it. You'd be foolish not to take your shot, XX.
Dialogue||Maybe, if you play your cards right. Anyway, you've surprised me before. I'd bet you have more surprises up your sleeve.
Dialogue||Man, I'm tired. The castle held some big royal parade after midnight the other day. Imagine, the castle guards all stomping down the streets non-stop![]My sewer was shaking the whole time, and it took forever to get to sleep!
Dialogue||A military parade sounds out of place for Withergate.
Dialogue||How did you finally get to sleep?
Dialogue||Oh, trust me, everyone pretty much feels the same way. No one really wants to watch a big, boring parade of armored stiffs walk up and down the streets.
Dialogue||I figured I'd wait it out, at first. But they never stopped. Finally I just went out into the forest and found a good log to snooze on.[]It's been awhile since I slept outside and I thought that would be as good a reason to as any.
Dialogue||What's the point of a parade?
Dialogue||Minos probably likes flaunting his power.
Dialogue||I guess it was to "celebrate Withergate's sovereignty," whatever that means. It sounds like a bunch of goblin cake to me.[]Just the king flexing his power, and keeping me awake! 
Dialogue||See, that's what I said! The parade was supposed to "celebrate Withergate's sovereignty", whatever that means.[]Like you said, though, it was just the king showing off his power, and keeping me awake!  
Dialogue||Desperate times call for Donovan solutions.
Dialogue||Maybe you'd have slept better if you had an apartment.
Dialogue||Whoa, that's an awesome saying! Did you get that from me? I feel like I've said that before. I'm using it from now on, either way.[]Thanks for cheering me up after that obnoxious parade.
Dialogue||One night of ruined sleep versus paying rent... let me see...[]Yeah, your idea is no good, XX. I'll take my chances with the parades. 
Dialogue||Lester is a joy to talk to. Calvin? Not so much.										
Dialogue||More people should experience a wanderer's lifestyle.																																																																																																																																												
Dialogue||The kids started calling me "Uncle Jun" today. They're so cute!																																																																																					
Dialogue||It's another peaceful day for Sun Haven. And yet, something ominous is in the air...																	
Dialogue||Hi, XX! Got any crops growing yet?[]Let's talk!
Dialogue||So you're in charge of all the soldiers in Sun Haven?
Dialogue||With the military here I can't help but wonder, is Sun Haven in any danger?
Dialogue||Yes indeed, I'm Captain of the guard. The Sun Haven Corps includes some of the finest soldiers I've seen! In truth, I'm honored to lead them.
Dialogue||At the moment? No, not at all. The army established this outpost as a preventative measure, see. We're only here to make sure nothing bad walks into town.
Dialogue||What makes them stand out from other soldiers?
Dialogue||You care for them quite a bit.
Dialogue||You won't find soldiers with more spirit than those under my command. Even if there isn't a lot of fighting to do here, they manage to keep their chins up.
Dialogue||Of course! They're in my charge, which means I'm responsible for turning them into the strongest soldiers possible. That's a responsibility I don't take lightly.
Dialogue||It's comforting to have you here.
Dialogue||Somehow, that makes me feel less safe.
Dialogue||I'm happy we're here, too. Sun Haven is a gem of a city. I'm glad to protect it.
Dialogue||What, really? I don't see why.
Dialogue||There you are, XX. I thought living with somebody would become a chore, but it's just the opposite with you.
Dialogue||I'm just thinking of our future together.
Dialogue||Are you happy in our relationship, Iris?
Dialogue||Good thoughts, I hope?
Dialogue||I never thought I'd be so happy, if you want me to be honest. I don't want to imagine a future without you in it, XX.
Dialogue||<i>Very</i> good thoughts, Iris. 
Dialogue||The future I see for us is nothing but goodness.
Dialogue||Thank goodness... I got a little worried there, XX! Be careful when you do that to me.
Dialogue||That's exactly how I feel.
Dialogue||I don't think our relationship is that serious.
Dialogue||If you feel the same way, then I see no reason to not take our relationship even further. If you're truly ready for that, of course. Oh, now my heart is racing... 
Dialogue||I thought we were on the same page about this... I don't know how I was so wrong.
Dialogue||You know, if you let me invest in your farm we could really increase production!
Dialogue||You think I need help on the farm?
Dialogue||Not everyone is so focused on productivity, Anne.
Dialogue||It's not about needing help, it's about expansion! Hire some workers, buy a little more land... I usually charge for this kind of advice, you know!
Dialogue||And not everyone gets to wear solid gold jewelry, but to each their own I guess!
Dialogue||I know you're just thinking about what's best for my future.
Dialogue||I don't need any of your help with my farm.
Dialogue||You're darn right I am! That's all I think about, you know. The future. Investments.[]We've got a very long road ahead of us, XX, and I want to pave it with gold.
Dialogue||I know that, but - oh, forget it. Stubborn farmers...
Dialogue||Do you even like wearing all that jewelry?
Dialogue||I really shouldn't be surprised by that answer.
Dialogue||Hey, I have an image to protect! And that image is sparkly and expensive.
Dialogue||No, you shouldn't! I wear my priorities on my sleeve. And on my ears, and around my neck. Get it?
Dialogue||Hey there farmer! Spending some time with the sea today?
Dialogue||I have to ask... about the crab.
Dialogue||What's your opinion on Withergate?
Dialogue||The what? Oh! You mean Shelby?
Dialogue||That's the city that's supposed to be dark all the time, right? I hear a lot of tall tales from port to port, but Withergate might be the tallest tale yet.
Dialogue||That's an adorable name! 
Dialogue||You named it?
Dialogue||She's the finest lady I ever sailed with. I was shipwrecked once and washed ashore. Shelby pinched me right on the cheeks and woke me up before the tide swept me out again.[]She's my savior, and my first mate!
Dialogue||I named <i>her</i>, and she's the finest lady I ever sailed with.[]I was shipwrecked once and washed ashore. Shelby pinched me right on the cheeks and woke me up before the tide swept me out again.[]She's my savior, and my first mate!
Dialogue||So you don't think it's true?
Dialogue||You aren't worried about the monsters, then?
Dialogue||I didn't say that. In my experience, it's best to be wary of these things, true or not.
Dialogue||*Yawn*
Dialogue||Oh![]Sorry XX, I didn't see you there. I'm glad it's just you and not anyone else. 
Dialogue||Is there anyone in Sun Haven you like to spend time with?
Dialogue||Claude... you're not dating anyone, right?
Dialogue||Aside from you, the answer's no. Some people are a bit more tolerable, I guess. But I don't think that's what you mean.
Dialogue||Huh? Why, um, do you assume that?[]Eh... forget it. Of course I'm not.
Dialogue||I'm glad you have somebody, even if it's just me.
Dialogue||It's unhealthy for you to be so antisocial.
Dialogue||"Just you" is more than enough for me, XX.
Dialogue||Calling me out on how antisocial I am doesn't exactly put me in the mood for making friends, XX.
Dialogue||I was just wondering.
Dialogue||Will you go out with me?
Dialogue||Okay...
Dialogue||Oh... Are you sure? I don't want you to feel obligated. If you don't change your mind, meet me in front of my house at 5:00 pm tomorrow.
Dialogue||Just because we're married doesn't mean I'll start wearing a collar or anything.																																																																						
Dialogue||Raising Pod on my own isn't easy, but I wouldn't trade it for anything in the world.			 					
Dialogue||Tonya keeps me in shape with a good diet... but I sneak off to Liam's every now and then for a treat. Oh, don't tell!												
Dialogue||I was in the middle of a cloud meditation when a bird flapped past my head. When I opened my eyes, the first thing I saw was you on your farm.[]I don't know, it felt like a meaningful moment to me.
Dialogue||Meaningful in what way?
Dialogue||What's a "cloud meditation?"
Dialogue||How to explain... From that high up, I can see farther than anybody. I could even see the Sun Dragon Elios on his mountaintop. But out of all that, I saw you on your farm.[]You and your farm were so small compared to everything, but you're still all I wanted to look at.
Dialogue||That's a style of meditation I invented! It's just what it sounds like - you settle on a cloud in the sky and meditate. It takes a lot of experience using wind magic, of course.
Dialogue||I'm lucky to have stolen your attention like that!
Dialogue||You need to practice staying focused.
Dialogue||Be sure, XX, it's nothing to do with luck. You've completely captivated me - even in meditation!
Dialogue||My point was that I'm focused on <i>you</i>, but I guess you didn't get that.
Dialogue||I'll keep my meditation on the ground for now.
Dialogue||That sounds peaceful.
Dialogue||I suppose it would be difficult for you to share that space with me. You're probably a few decades away from that level of mastery.
Dialogue||It might be the most peaceful space I've found for myself. I wish I could share it with you, but you're probably a few decades away from that level of mastery.
Dialogue||Topi and Pod are fun to play with, but Pod cheats at hide-and-seek!																																																																																																				
Dialogue||If I keep seeing you around like this, I'm going to have to hide out in the carnival.
Dialogue||Is that your favorite thing about Withergate - the carnival?
Dialogue||So was the carnival your idea?
Dialogue||Well, the carnival is great, but really the best thing about Withergate is my position here.[]The people here respect me, fear me, and desire me all at once. What more could I want?
Dialogue||What do you think? Of course, that carnival is my baby! I didn't want to live in some boring city with no nightlife, so I pitched the idea.[]Thankfully the Demon King appreciates fun as much as I do. Now I have a great place to hang out and bragging rights to boot.
Dialogue||Why would you want to be feared?
Dialogue||What - um - makes you think I desire you?
Dialogue||Asked like a true commoner. Take notes, sewer rat: fear is power and power is freedom.[]When you ask why I want to be feared, what you're really asking is, "Why do you want to be free?"
Dialogue||Oh come on, sewer rat. You really think I haven't noticed you glancing up and down? Like I told you some time ago, we keep our eyes and ears open around here.
Dialogue||So you made it just so you wouldn't be bored here?
Dialogue||I've seen the carnival - it really is fun!
Dialogue||Of course. Oh, what have they got in Sun Haven again? A library? And you're telling me you don't get bored over there? Yeah, right.[]Just admit that we monsters know how to have more fun than those humans. Come on, I know you're thinking it!
Dialogue||You're darn right it is. What better way is there to bring people together than a carnival? You'll see, the success of Withergate will boil down to games and neon lights, with me to thank.
Dialogue||Liam laughs a lot when we play games. I laugh, too!
Dialogue||XX, I was just wondering something about you. I don't want to ask anything that might make you uncomfortable, though.
Dialogue||Vaan, you can ask me whatever you want, anytime.
Dialogue||Well, it's a couple things... but I was thinking about my connection to magic. It seems to be... louder than usual, if that makes sense.
Dialogue||I know that. I'm a little astonished with you, XX. I can already tell that you're an important person in my life. Someone who will change me, for the better.[]Because of that, I want to give you something. It's my ruby ring.
Dialogue||I don't have much of a connection to magic.
Dialogue||My connection to magic has been getting stronger, too.
Dialogue||Is that true? Hm, that's surprising to hear. I thought someone like you would be attuned to magical energies. Just don't close yourself off to the idea, okay?
Dialogue||Ah, that's interesting. So you think it means I'm getting stronger? You might be right, actually. But it's a very intense feeling. I just don't know what started it.[]I noticed it not long after meeting you, actually. I wonder if... Hm, I should talk to Nivara.
Dialogue||Your ruby ring?
Dialogue||Is this important?
Dialogue||Yes, it has great personal value to me. I trust you to take care of it, and it should help keep you safe too. I know you won't lose it, XX.
Dialogue||What are you looking at? ... Jeez, your eyes are gorgeous.																						
Dialogue||If you're not buying or selling, you're getting left behind.
Dialogue||Hello again, XX. Another beautiful day, don't you think? It's easier to work when the weather is nice.
Dialogue||What kind of work do you do here?
Dialogue||You seem like someone with a plan. What are your goals?
Dialogue||Herbal remedies are my specialty, but I also dabble in potions.
Dialogue||Honestly, I just want to see my city thrive again. I even go around town casting small enchantments to help bring some business back to town.[]And you know... I wouldn't mind finding a cute partner in the meantime!
Dialogue||Is all of that safe?
Dialogue||Why come to you for remedies when we can just go to Dr. Wornhardt?
Dialogue||People have doubted my products before, but they change their mind when they actually try some. Here XX, take a sample!
Dialogue||Wornhardt is great at what he does, but he can't give the same boosts I can. Try some of my restorative herbs sometime and you'll see what I mean.
Dialogue||I'm sure you'll find someone soon, Catherine!
Dialogue||Why cast enchantments when Elios's magic helps the whole town?
Dialogue||Oh, you think? Do you know something that I don't, XX?[]Just kidding, but thanks for the vote of confidence!
Dialogue||I guess that's the difference between us, XX. I can't just sit around while somebody else fixes things for me.
Dialogue||Um, hi... Who are you?
Dialogue||My name's XX. I'm the new farmer.
Dialogue||We have a new farmer? Nobody told me!
Dialogue||I love that the sun is always shining here.	It reminds me to shine, too!									
Dialogue||I've heard tales that Withergate is a city in eternal darkness. How depressing that must be.
Dialogue||Do you not like the night?
Dialogue||The people living in Withergate must love it.
Dialogue||Well, no, that's not it. I quite like night, actually. It gives life a chance to rest. It also allows other types of life to flourish, under the light of the stars.[]But eternal night? Without ever seeing the sun? So many plants and animals would perish. I don't think I'd fare any better, either.
Dialogue||Maybe they do. I suppose I can't judge, but still... the thought of endless night gives me a chill. Is it true that Demons can not tolerate sunlight?[]The sun is the giver of energy and life. It's odd to imagine anyone could live without it.
Dialogue||Good thing you're in Nel'Vari!
Dialogue||You don't sound cut out for Withergate.
Dialogue||Yes, I'm comfortable as can be right where I am. I was born for Nel'Vari. Let Withergate keep its eternal night!
Dialogue||You aren't making fun of me, are you, XX? I love living in Nel'Vari. Let Withergate keep its eternal night!
Dialogue||Think of how life must have adapted to the dark.
Dialogue||You sound pretty judgmental.
Dialogue||That's a good point. Surely there must be plenty of flora and fauna in and around this Withergate. Life tends to find a way, even if it's living in an endless night.
Dialogue||Do I? I'm not trying to be, but the concept is just so strange to me. I'm sorry, I just have a hard time grasping it.
Dialogue||Come by the shop later, XX. I've got some great baked goods for you to try.
Dialogue||Ah, XX. I was hoping to find you. Would you be interested in a town survey?
Dialogue||Why are you doing a town survey?
Dialogue||I'll bite. Show me the survey, Jun.
Dialogue||It's nothing, really. I like to prepare little things like this from time to time, just to gauge how Sun Haven's citizens are feeling on certain topics.
Dialogue||Excellent. I'm glad you don't mind taking the time to help out! Sometimes people get too busy for this stuff, but that's okay, too.[]Making Sun Haven the best it can be is a big part of why I do anything I do, so every voice counts![]Anyways, the survey is really just one question, but: What do you think of the town bulletin board?
Dialogue||You do too much, Jun!
Dialogue||I suppose that can be helpful information for your job.
Dialogue||Ah, it's not necessarily something for my job! I just enjoy knowing how everyone feels on things.[]Sure, it comes back to help me as Counselor, but it's also just nice to get everyone's thoughts and feelings.
Dialogue||It's great! I don't have to talk to people as much.
Dialogue||It's a great way to see who needs help around town.
Dialogue||I see. So you value it for the purpose of not needing to directly interact with others. Not exactly the real purpose of the bulletin board, but I suppose it's just how you feel.
Dialogue||So you're saying you feel pretty positive towards it? That's good to hear, XX. I believe helping one another is the best way to build a strong community!
Dialogue||Hey XX, who do you think is a better caretaker? Me, or Kitty?[]You know what, it's a pointless comparison. I shouldn't let her get in my head.
Dialogue||Well, she's not "Doctor Kitty," right?
Dialogue||You're experienced in caring for people, but what about pets?
Dialogue||Fair point, I guess I do have the certification. It's just that she said I need to give my patients more love. I just don't think it works that way with people. 
Dialogue||Well sure, I've got my pet mouse. Have I told you about him? His name is Charlie! He's really smart, you'd be surprised.
Dialogue||Don't worry about Kitty, you know what you're doing.
Dialogue||You could be a warmer person.
Dialogue||Right, right. Of course, I just need to trust myself a bit more. Thanks for screwing my head on straight, XX.
Dialogue||You really think that? I try so hard to be friendly.
Dialogue||Why a mouse?
Dialogue||Mice are great pets! 
Dialogue||Charlie was already in my house when I moved in, so I just bought him a cage and some food and we've been buds ever since.
Dialogue||I agree! Charlie's really easy to take care of, too. Aside from feeding, watering, cage cleaning, bath time, and health check-ups, he basically cares for himself!
Dialogue||People say we have the best service in the entire Western Region. You won't hear any argument from me!																																																	
Dialogue||Should I get a pet? Oops, I'm thinking out loud. Good thing Pod didn't hear!			 					
Dialogue||At times, it seems like Sun Haven really is on its way back to normal.																																																																																																																												
Dialogue||Good seeing you again, XX. I'm glad I could catch you between projects. Enchanting is busy work, you know.
Dialogue||What do you do when you're not working?
Dialogue||If you weren't an enchantress, what would you do instead?
Dialogue||I'm always trying to learn what I can, so I read a lot of books. Sometimes I'll read something that leads to a big discovery!
Dialogue||That's easy. I would definitely be a woodworker - I know, predictable answer.
Dialogue||That just sounds like more work.
Dialogue||What do you mean by "big discovery?" It sounds interesting!
Dialogue||Really? I think it's fun. Maybe I do work too much... aaand I already decided that I don't care.
Dialogue||Well, I figured out how to make flowers fireproof. Oh, and last year I managed an interesting serum that doubles the number of roots a plant has! That one was big.[]Am I bragging? I feel like I'm bragging.
Dialogue||That was maybe not as predictable as you think.
Dialogue||Of course, I totally saw that coming!
Dialogue||Oh, really? Lots of Elves are woodworkers. For me, it's just another way to feel close to nature.[]I feel connected to nature when I'm enchanting, but it's different with woodcraft. Feeling the wood with your hands and working with it to create something beautiful... It's just different.
Dialogue||Is it just me, or do my tattoos look a little darker?
Dialogue||The Moon Dragon once told me that I would forge a strong alliance to lead Withergate into the future. I had no way of knowing it would be with a resident of Sun Haven.
Dialogue||Do you think that means something?
Dialogue||Have you learned much from the Moon Dragon?
Dialogue||Who knows? It could mean a future alliance between our towns. Or, it could mean Withergate's conquest over Sun Haven, as well as the outlying towns.[]There's really no telling. Perhaps I should confer with the Moon Dragon again.
Dialogue||Dynus is extremely knowledgeable, but he is no teacher. He granted me his blessing, which increased my strength well past its natural limits. Other than that, he simply keeps the skies dark.
Dialogue||I can't believe you would threaten to overthrow Sun Haven!
Dialogue||We will figure it out together, when the time comes.
Dialogue||If you let sentiment hold you back, XX, you will have a difficult time adjusting to leadership.
Dialogue||Precisely. You already have the makings of a true ruler, XX. You're ruthless and decisive, but you also know when patience is needed.
Dialogue||Dynus really doesn't help you lead Withergate at all?
Dialogue||It doesn't sound like he's much of a guardian.
Dialogue||Why should he? My father has done an acceptable job so far, and I will do an even better job of it. There's no use in a dragon getting involved in the city life of Withergate.
Dialogue||I would hold my tongue before speaking like that, for your own sake. If a guard heard you speaking like that, they would have to report it to Dynus.[]There's no telling how he would react then - the Moon Dragon is both powerful and temperamental.
Dialogue||Stop by the barracks sometime if you want to practice your swordplay.																																																																			
Dialogue||Hey, neighbor! I'm Doctor Wornhardt. You look plenty healthy to me, but come see me if you're feeling under the weather.
Dialogue||Wow, thanks! I'm XX, glad to meet you, doctor.
Dialogue||You can call me Wornhardt if you don't want to call me doctor. But really, I don't mind either way!
Dialogue||Aha! Another fan has come to admire my flavorsome beverages!
Dialogue||Um, my name's XX. Who are you?
Dialogue||You - have no idea who I am!?[]<b>Ahem.</b>[]I am Dr. Hopsan Barley, best brewmaster in all the regions! I'm glad you've made my acquaintance.
Dialogue||I don't think you realize just how lucky you are, XX. I have a lot of suitors, you know. But you're the only one who ever got a ring on me.
Dialogue||You had other suitors?
Dialogue||Putting a ring on you was no easy feat!
Dialogue||Well, they thought so. I never really had an interest in any of them despite the many, many gifts they sent me.[]I've gained admirers in a lot of places, but all of them want me the same way they want a pile of gold. You're the only person who's made me feel wanted as a person and not a trophy.
Dialogue||Good! I've worked hard my entire life - it's time someone else worked hard for <i>me</i>![]When it comes down to it, it makes sense that the hardest worker won me over. And nobody works harder than a farmer! 
Dialogue||Who needs trophies when I've got you?
Dialogue||You should have told me about these "suitors" earlier.
Dialogue||Heh, oh <i>please</i> get all sappy for me, XX. I think I'm warming up to your cheesy lines!
Dialogue||Really, XX? They were nothing to me, so why mention them?[]We're married, remember? You don't need to be so insecure.
Dialogue||I could say the same about you, Miss Renowned Merchant.
Dialogue||I wasn't competing, I was only doing what I wanted to do.
Dialogue||Excuse me? That's <i>Mrs.</i> Renowned Merchant now!
Dialogue||That's the kind of thing that sets you apart from the others XX. Did you hear yourself? You weren't even competing! Oh my, what style, what class! 
Dialogue||Grammy told me Sun Haven was a nice town. Once again, she was right!
Dialogue||What made you choose to be a miner?
Dialogue||Grammy?
Dialogue||Mines are where I'm the most comfortable - I'd rather be underground than above ground most of the time. But you can't sell your wares where people can't see you.
Dialogue||Grammy, Grams, Mee-Maw, Grandma! I owe her a lot. She's the one that supported my dream of being a traveling merchant in the first place.
Dialogue||You're like a mole!
Dialogue||You don't ever feel uncomfortable underground?
Dialogue||Haha! That's a good one! I'm definitely a mole.
Dialogue||Not as long as I've got light. It's nice and cozy down there with all the rocks. Rocks are our oldest friends!
Dialogue||Isn't she worried about your safety, traveling so much?
Dialogue||Grammys are the best. Everyone should be close with their "mee-maw."
Dialogue||Oh gosh, do you think I'm worrying her? I should send her a letter.
Dialogue||I agree completely! Our elders need to be cherished.
Dialogue||You've been with us in Sun Haven for a good time now, XX. You've truly become an integral part of our community!
Dialogue||Am I really that important to Sun Haven?
Dialogue||Is it hard to keep track of everyone living in town?
Dialogue||I couldn't imagine Sun Haven without a Kitty or an Emmett, or a <i>you</i>! Everyone is important, but more than that, everyone is a <i>part</i> of our town.[]Sun Haven wouldn't be the same without you rushing up and down the streets, busy with your endeavours. I hope you plan to stay with us for a long time, XX.
Dialogue||It's not difficult at all. It's not only part of my job, but it's also something I'm genuinely interested in doing.[]I may be Sun Haven's leader, but being leader is meaningless if I don't know the people I'm responsible for. It's a lot of work to keep track of everyone, but it's work I love.
Dialogue||I hope to stay here a long time, too.
Dialogue||Sun Haven is honestly pretty dull.
Dialogue||That's what I was hoping! You're part of the Sun Haven family now, you can't just up and leave us!
Dialogue||That really is too bad that feel that way, XX. If you ever left us, your presence would be sorely missed.
Dialogue||You're really a true leader.
Dialogue||That sounds about right, coming from you.
Dialogue||Oh, please. It's everyone in Sun Haven who inspires me. If not for all of you, I wouldn't be doing this!
Dialogue||Well, you have gotten to know me quite well, XX. I must finally be running low on surprises!
Dialogue||Go ahead and browse. Just stop breathing on me please, I'm trying to finish this chapter.
Dialogue||Don't forget to stay hydrated. It's a warm one today.
Dialogue||So what made you join the army in the first place?
Dialogue||You look really strong!
Dialogue||I love physical fitness and pushing myself with new challenges. Oh, and I really love competition.[]The army combines all my favorite things into one job!
Dialogue||I do my own extra training every day. I want to hit peak performance so I can impress Roza.
Dialogue||You must be a fierce soldier.
Dialogue||Does all your training come in handy?
Dialogue||Well, I've never actually seen any combat... but I almost always come out on top in sparring practice.
Dialogue||Too much exercise can be a bad thing, you know.
Dialogue||That's some real commitment.
Dialogue||I'm not saying you're wrong, I'm just saying I don't care.
Dialogue||Thanks! It figures that only a farmer would understand my dedication.
Dialogue||It's about time someone worthy came to me, even if it was from beyond Withergate's borders.																																				 									
Dialogue||Hello there! I'm Rex. I know all there is to know about digging underground.
Dialogue||Hi Rex, I'm XX. Did you say, underground?
Dialogue||That's right! I'm a traveling merchant selling all the mining gear you need.
Dialogue||I've been in Sun Haven for a while now. If business keeps picking up, I may stick around longer than I thought.																										
Dialogue||After living here for thirty years, I can tell you this for sure - Sun Haven never gets dull.
Dialogue||Thirty years is a long time.
Dialogue||What's your favorite memory from your time here?
Dialogue||I know, I'm an old geezer. I don't mind one bit! I've got a lot of experience to lean on.
Dialogue||The best day of my life was the day I met my wife Judith. I was still new in Sun Haven, and she smiled at me from across the town square. Took my breath away!
Dialogue||Have any advice for someone like me? 
Dialogue||What has your experience taught you? 
Dialogue||Hm, I guess if I've learned anything in my time... Don't eat a bowl of spiced beans before getting into a suit of armor.
Dialogue||That's so romantic!
Dialogue||Sounds like you've lived a pretty boring life.
Dialogue||Every day I'm thankful that we met so early. It's been paradise ever since.
Dialogue||Is this how the youth treats their elders now? What a shame...
Dialogue||There you are. I hope you're feeling well today. I slept weird on my neck, but I feel... better than usual.
Dialogue||You look nice and relaxed, Claude.
Dialogue||Are you happy with our relationship?
Dialogue||If I do, it's only because of you. You have me thinking about things other than my work. Sometimes it's nice to... unfocus. 
Dialogue||Finding happiness is something I've had trouble with... but when it comes to you, it's been as natural as breathing. I actually can't believe how happy you've made me.[]When I think about tomorrow, I don't just hear music. I hear your voice, XX.  
Dialogue||Unfocus what?
Dialogue||So you actually feel better, too?
Dialogue||Just, myself. It's a relief.[]I think I was working myself ragged before you started spending time with me. In fact, having something else to focus on has made my work a lot more productive.
Dialogue||Definitely. I think I was working myself ragged before you started spending time with me. In fact, having something else to focus on has made my work a lot more productive.
Dialogue||You should still focus on your music.
Dialogue||Is there room for both me and music in your life?
Dialogue||Is that really what you think? I see.
Dialogue||Fair question, heh. There's more than enough room for you. And if it came down to it, I see myself putting you before my music. You've come to mean that much to me.[]I hope you don't think that sounds like too much, XX. I just don't see myself without anymore. 
Dialogue||If you're going to spend so much time here, you might as well help out. Most of our citizens contribute somehow, you know.
Dialogue||Is that where all of this technology came from?
Dialogue||Hey, I'm a very helpful person.
Dialogue||I'd love to take credit for all our awesome lights, but that's the one part of Withergate I had nothing to do with.[]The people actually brought all this technology with them from... wherever they came from. The takeaway is, even our lowest citizens have more to offer than your Human town!
Dialogue||Maybe, or maybe you're just in it for the pay.[]Actually, that reminds me. I have something for you. Don't read into it too much, but it's a gift.
Dialogue||You still had something to do with it, you know.
Dialogue||You shouldn't call them your "lowest citizens."
Dialogue||Hm, yeah I guess you're right. They wouldn't even be here if not for me. Good point, farmer!
Dialogue||If that actually bothers you, then you have no sense of class. It's called hierarchy, and you're at the bottom.
Dialogue||Wait, you have a gift for me?
Dialogue||You've never surprised me like this before!
Dialogue||Yeah yeah, don't make a big thing about it. I figure since we're starting to be... friends and all...[]Anyway, just take this. It's a chess piece, the black queen. I swiped it from the Demon King's chess set when we were remodeling the throne room.[]I thought it would remind you of me. Also, I don't want to get blamed for the stolen piece. You're welcome!
Dialogue||Elizabeth is shortest but only by a little bit.										
Dialogue||I never thought there'd be someone like you for me, XX.																	
Dialogue||Sun Haven is fortunate to have someone as capable as you. I'm fortunate, as well...																																		
Dialogue||Look here, my newest favorite customer. Take a seat, XX.[]I want you to think of this place as your home away from home. 
Dialogue||You're so hospitable Mari, I can't imagine anyone giving you trouble.
Dialogue||Is it difficult running the inn upstairs?
Dialogue||You'd be surprised then. There's always some troublemakers comin' through with the season.
Dialogue||The only difficulty is when squatters don't want to leave. I guess I can't blame 'em though. Our beds are mighty comfy!
Dialogue||Thank goodness they're only seasonal!
Dialogue||You just point them out to me, and I'll take care of them.
Dialogue||Hah, seasonal! Yep, I guess that's right. All the good eggs stay right here in Sun Haven.
Dialogue||I've been doin' that job for twenty years now. Believe you me, I can handle it.
Dialogue||How do you get them out?
Dialogue||Does that happen a lot?
Dialogue||One time we had to smoke 'em out of the room they were in. Usually we just use the keys, though.
Dialogue||Not a lot, but maybe once or twice a year. Only during the busy season, though. Which lately, there hasn't been much of any busy season.
Dialogue||What are you looking at, sewer rat?														
Dialogue||XX, I think you've gotten stronger since we first met. I wonder, is that the farming? Or have you been going on adventures without me?
Dialogue||You go on adventures without me, right?
Dialogue||I can't help it if I'm getting stronger.
Dialogue||Oh, yes. I didn't mean to sound like I was accusing you or anything. It's important to spend time apart, too.
Dialogue||Of course not. I actually think it looks quite good on you. I'm happy to see you taking good care of yourself, that's all.
Dialogue||Do you wish we spent more time together?
Dialogue||Do you think we spend too much time together?
Dialogue||I'm not worried about us, XX. It's good to have some space. Something Nivara once told me is, "the tallest trees of the forest grow not in each other's shadow."
Dialogue||Oh Vaan - still admiring me from afar after all this time?
Dialogue||Will you ever stop watching me from a distance?
Dialogue||I can't help it if I'm enamored by you still. You won my heart at first sight, and every time after that.
Dialogue||Ah! When you point it out like that, it makes it sound bad!
Dialogue||Hello again, farmer. Are you settling in well? For me it's... in progress. 
Dialogue||Pinto, where are you from? 
Dialogue||How old are you?
Dialogue||I came down from the Northern Region. I like the weather here way better than there. Still, I miss my friends.
Dialogue||I look young, but I'm old enough to be a recruit. Barely.
Dialogue||You won't last if you're already regretting it.
Dialogue||It was brave of you to make that journey.
Dialogue||Do you think so? Man, maybe you have a point...
Dialogue||Wow, brave? I don't think anyone has called me brave before.
Dialogue||You're new to the army, then? 
Dialogue||What made you join?
Dialogue||I'm still in training. It's a lot of fun! But I'm not very good at it yet.
Dialogue||My dad said it would build character. I'm not sure what he means by that, though.
Dialogue||When I'm sculpting, I try to picture the sculpture inside the stone. Then I remove the bits that don't belong.							
Dialogue||Solon acts a little gruff, but he's such a sweetheart. Ever since our marriage, he's seemed extra proud of me.
Dialogue||Solon is right to be proud of you.
Dialogue||Solon must see you kind of like a daughter.
Dialogue||You think so, XX? I've come a really long way with my skills since moving to Sun Haven, it's good to be recognized by two of the most important people to me.
Dialogue||It's so cute, but I think so too! Thinking back on it, when I first arrived in Sun Haven, Solon really seemed to help me settle in and adjust.[]I didn't really recognize it at the time, but I think he really wanted to help me out. I'm so lucky to have found so many great people here!
Dialogue||Think you'll ever be better than your foremothers?
Dialogue||Think you'll ever be better than Solon?
Dialogue||Ohhh, now that I don't want to think about! My mother and grandmother are both so awesome at their work, I don't want to think of how far behind I still must be![]I'm just going to take it, one day at a time, and not focus on how far away I am! Solon is a great teacher, I know I'll get there someday.
Dialogue||Ohhh, now that I don't want to think about! Solon is probably the single most skilled blacksmith I've ever met! But, he <i>is</i> teaching me, after all.[]Maybe it's inevitable that I'll surpass him eventually. The student becomes the teacher, right? Solon is a great teacher, so I know I'll get there someday.
Dialogue||I'm glad you found happiness in Sun Haven.
Dialogue||Don't you ever want something more? 
Dialogue||I found more than just happiness. I found the rest of my life! I never wanted too much, but building a life with you and working with Solon is more than enough.
Dialogue||Ooh, I know, it's tradition for my village!! You can't ever tell my mother, alright? She'd never let me hear the end of it!
Dialogue||Maybe one day we'll get out of Sun Haven. What do you think, XX?
Dialogue||One step at a time, Claude.
Dialogue||I'm curious, where would you live if you weren't in Sun Haven?
Dialogue||You're right, I'm sorry. I haven't ever felt such excitement for the future. It's difficult not to indulge in fantasy.
Dialogue||If I had my choice, probably somewhere in the Northern Region. I hear the cold is unforgiving. There must be a song somewhere in all that cold.
Dialogue||I would never leave Sun Haven with you. This is my home.
Dialogue||It doesn't matter where, Claude, as long as we're together.
Dialogue||I see. I guess Sun Haven really grew on you. If I have to stay here longer, at least it's with you.
Dialogue||Everything you say to me is soothing to my mind. Right when my thoughts start racing, you come in and slow everything down. It's a really good thing for me, XX.
Dialogue||That's not what I expected at all.
Dialogue||That makes sense for you.
Dialogue||Well, the south is nothing but tourist trap islands. East and west are just more of the same. The north is the only place that offers anything different.
Dialogue||Excuse me if I seem short of breath, XX. I was just practicing some fireballs at home.
Dialogue||You practice fire magic in your house?
Dialogue||Lucia, how strong is your magic really?
Dialogue||Yes, I have a training area beneath my house. It's perfect for practicing my spells. Grandfather used to call them "fire drills."[]The next time you visit my home, you should look closely at my owl statue!
Dialogue||As a matter of fact, I've mastered fire magic since I was blessed by Elios. But that doesn't quite answer the question, does it? Oh, I have a story for you![]A few years ago, I found a fledgling dragon tangled in brambles. It was quite scared, spouting flames in every direction. I wanted to help, but it wouldn't allow me to. So, I established dominance.[]Every time the dragon spat fire my way, I responded with a larger burst of flame. Eventually, the young dragon submitted and allowed me to set it free!
Dialogue||A secret training area? Isn't that a little overboard?
Dialogue||You're like a hero from a novel! 
Dialogue||It's not so much a secret as it is safe. It was important for me to have a safe place to practice when I was a child. Otherwise, half of Sun Haven may have burned down!
Dialogue||Oh! Hah, I don't know if I would say that. I only needed a safe place to practice when I was a child. Otherwise, half of Sun Haven may have burned down!
Dialogue||You beat a dragon? That's amazing!
Dialogue||That story doesn't make you sound so tough.
Dialogue||It was merely a fledgling, but still quite a challenge! Besides, you never really doubted my strength, right XX?
Dialogue||I'll keep that in mind the next time you're fighting a dragon!
Dialogue||Sophistication is in short supply in Sun Haven, but that doesn't mean we mustn't try.											
Dialogue||I can't chat for long right now, but I'm glad we officially met, XX.
Dialogue||Pull up a rod, but be quiet about it. Don't wanna scare my next catch.
Dialogue||I asked my dad if we could get a pet dragon. He said maybe!																																																																																																																																																																																			
Dialogue||I'm doing well today. Thanks for dropping by, XX.																																																										 																																																										
Dialogue||In my experience I've learned one thing - don't go without a gift!										
Dialogue||I took a peek at your farm earlier - it's really coming together!
Dialogue||Well hello there, welcome on in. I'm Mari, and I'll be takin' good care of you today. 
Dialogue||Hi Mari, I'm XX. I just moved in
Dialogue||Then that must make you the farmer. Lucia made her rounds and gave us all a heads up. Glad to have ya in Sun Haven!
Dialogue||I'm already so used to seeing you here that I forgot you're not native to Nel'Vari.
Dialogue||If you didn't live in Nel'Vari, where would you want to live?
Dialogue||I'm looking forward to our second date.
Dialogue||That's tough. I don't know many places outside of Nel'Vari and Sun Haven. Although, I have heard of towering peaks in the Northern Region covered in snow.[]The wind must blast up those steep cliffs with such force... I can only imagine what I would learn from the wind there.
Dialogue||So you've been thinking about that too? I admit, it's been on my mind. How about tomorrow?
Dialogue||You would freeze.
Dialogue||You're so dedicated to your mastery, Vaan.
Dialogue||That's a risk I'm willing to take if it means further mastering my magic.
Dialogue||Thank you! I'm delighted that you noticed, XX. People don't realize how hard I work for my magic.
Dialogue||Sure, I'd love to!
Dialogue||It's best that we don't, Vaan.
Dialogue||Alright! Meet outside of my house tomorrow night at 5:00 pm. I can't wait to see you there, XX.
Dialogue||No problem, I completely understand. Even if it is disappointing.
Dialogue||I just don't feel like talking right now.
Dialogue||I've been hearing a lot of talk lately. I think people know about us!
Dialogue||Does that worry you? I thought you weren't afraid of anything!
Dialogue||I've never been so popular!
Dialogue||What am I, some kind of action novel hero? Of course I have fears, XX. I'm just a person. But I'm not afraid of talk. Talk is just, talk.
Dialogue||No? First time for everything, I guess![]I'm used to this kind of attention, but that shouldn't surprise you. Getting people to talk about me is part of my business plan, after all.
Dialogue||Will you tell me what scares you, then?
Dialogue||And here I thought you lived fearlessly.
Dialogue||All right, sure. Part of me will always be afraid of losing everything, going broke, and living on the streets again. Also... crabs kind of freak me out.[]Have you noticed that I stay away from Peter? Now you know why. I can't believe he lives with that sea bug on his head!
Dialogue||You're being weird, XX. I'm just a normal person like anyone else. Except, more successful and attractive.
Dialogue||You've always got a plan, huh?
Dialogue||Is the attention tiring?
Dialogue||Well, not always. To tell you the truth, a lot of the time I'm just making it up as I go. I just do well when the pressure is on! I bet you know what that's like, too.
Dialogue||Yes, in a way, but it's something I've lived with for years now. It's not going anywhere, and I refuse to let it run me down.[]It feels good to talk about it a bit. I haven't had the chance to do that very much before you.
Dialogue||How many soldiers does it take to keep this place safe, anyway?												
Dialogue||You have a thoughtful look on your face, XX. What's on your mind?
Dialogue||I'm thinking about the future.
Dialogue||I see. It has been some time since we've talked about the future. For me, it looks more bright and clear than I would have ever thought.
Dialogue||XX! I'm surprised at you. Of course I'm happy, how could I not be?[]Besides, if I was unhappy then I'd be sure to let you know. It... wouldn't be pretty.[]Why do you ask?
Dialogue||Why are you so sure about it?
Dialogue||Has your vision of the future changed?
Dialogue||Oh, I know this is going to sound corny... but there's no avoiding it.[]Now that I've got you with me, I see nothing but happiness in my future. I hope you feel the same way, XX.
Dialogue||I was just having doubts.
Dialogue||I was wondering what it would be like if we were together, forever.
Dialogue||That wasn't the direction I thought this conversation was headed... Rest assured, XX, that I will stand by your side any day. If you want me there, I mean.
Dialogue||Are you saying what I think you're saying? XX, it sounds like you're talking about a big step - <i>the</i> big step![]You should know, that I'll stand by your side any day!
Dialogue||Now that we've been together so much, I'm starting to smell you in my clothes... I really love it!
Dialogue||What's on your agenda today, lovebug?
Dialogue||I want to cook you a special dinner soon. What is your favorite meal?
Dialogue||Oh, Solon is behind on a couple of custom orders, again, so I'll have to cover for him, again. Just another day at the forge.
Dialogue||Oh XX, you know this already!
Dialogue||Wait, you're doing his work now?
Dialogue||I can't believe you're doing Solon's projects for him!
Dialogue||Yes, but only when he's behind. I don't really mind since he gives me a bonus. And also...[]People really think my work is his! You wouldn't believe how much of Solon's "master work" is actually mine.
Dialogue||It's only when he's behind. I don't really mind since he gives me a bonus. And also...[]People really think my work is his! You wouldn't believe how much of Solon's "master work" is actually mine.
Dialogue||Creamy beef stew?
Dialogue||Spicy Ramen?
Dialogue||Wow, you really remembered! You're the best, XX.
Dialogue||Sorry sweetie, that's not it. Oh but don't worry! I don't blame you - I only told you once, after all. I love creamy beef stew, remember?
Dialogue||My favorite farmer! Are you feeling good today? I am!
Dialogue||You seem more cheery than usual.
Dialogue||You know, I keep thinking about that date we had...
Dialogue||I'm just excited. Excited because I have something special for you!
Dialogue||I do too, XX. Nobody has ever asked to spend time alone with me like that. I think about it a lot.
Dialogue||Don't keep me waiting - I can't handle the anticipation!
Dialogue||Oh Lynn, you didn't have to do anything for me.
Dialogue||Well, I wanted to make something for you but then I thought maybe you deserved something even more special. So, here.[]This is my shield. It bears my family's crest, so please be careful with it. That means absolutely no using it in combat, please!
Dialogue||I want you to know, I think we should just stay good friends.
Dialogue||Let's go out again!
Dialogue||I see... That's fine, XX. I'm glad to be your friend!
Dialogue||I would love that! This time let's go to my house. Maybe come by around 5:00 pm?
Dialogue||There isn't a person in the west that can pull flavor out of coffee beans like me.									
Dialogue||Hey, farmer. Your face is looking a little sun-kissed.
Dialogue||What do you do when you're not working the forge?
Dialogue||Have you heard of Withergate?
Dialogue||What's it matter to you?
Dialogue||The monster city, yeah I've heard of it. Haven't seen it though. Can't be sure anyone has.
Dialogue||I was just asking. 
Dialogue||I guess it doesn't.
Dialogue||Hm. I walk around Sun Haven, get some clean air in my lungs. Then I go home. Is that what you wanted to know?
Dialogue||Aren't you worried about it?
Dialogue||No sense in worrying, then.
Dialogue||What are you, some kind of sissy? Get your act together. 
Dialogue||Yep, that's how I see it. Even if there <i>is</i> a city of monsters out there, they don't seem to care much about us.
Dialogue||I always wanted someone like you in my life.																																																												
Dialogue||I can smell the sea on the wind, even this far into the forest. That means a lucky day!
Dialogue||What are you up to today?
Dialogue||I didn't think you believed in luck.
Dialogue||There's a heavy branch that sticks out of the top of the Grand Tree which makes for a good seat. I was hoping to spend some time up there today.
Dialogue||Well, you know that I think the future is completely in our control. But outside forces have an influence too, even if it's small.
Dialogue||That sounds dangerous.
Dialogue||It's like a separate little world up there. I've been watching a bird's nest that I think is close to hatching, too. I hope to see it when it happens!
Dialogue||Maybe it is, but I've found great clarity in places like that.
Dialogue||What do you mean?
Dialogue||I've had great luck since I moved to Sun Haven.
Dialogue||Let me put it this way - if you work harder, then your farm succeeds. But sometimes it rains, and your farm succeeds without you.[]That's a small example of how luck can help us, even when we're firmly in control of our actions.
Dialogue||You took matters into your own hands - chose your own future - and the luck rode in your wake.
Dialogue||I'm stocking white sand, all the way from the volcanic beaches of the Southern Islands! They say it has medicinal purposes.
Dialogue||I don't know about that, but it does sound like fancy sand.
Dialogue||Do you believe the sand really works as medicine?
Dialogue||Yes. It's super fine, even for your typical beach sand. Pure white, too.[]Sailors say it looks like snow from a distance. And it even stays nice and cool in the sun!
Dialogue||Well... no. I think it's just white sand. Pretty sand, but still just sand.[]But it's not like I'm the one who's calling it medicine! People can believe what they want, I just sell the goods.
Dialogue||It's like a touch of the south.
Dialogue||It would look pretty in a glass bottle.
Dialogue||...[]Can I use that as a sales pitch? I'm using it as a sales pitch. 
Dialogue||Hm. An interesting idea, very classy. Most people would call it "decorative art," but I just call it "an easy way to charge more than it's worth."[]I wonder where I could source some fancy looking bottles... Hmm...
Dialogue||You just told me that people use it as medicine!
Dialogue||Calculating as ever, Anne.
Dialogue||No, I said <i>they say</i> it has medicinal purposes. That's totally different!
Dialogue||Aw, why thank you, XX. Wait, you <i>did</i> mean that as a compliment, right?[]It's not like I'm the one who started the idea that the sand does anything, you know!
Dialogue||I see you eyeballing our baked goods - they taste as good as they look!											
Dialogue||You just can't stay away, can you XX?
Dialogue||I could stay away, but I'd rather go on another date with you.
Dialogue||You don't like the attention?
Dialogue||Stepping up to bat again! I'm impressed with you, XX. I figured the first time you asked, you had just bumped your head or something!
Dialogue||I love attention, that will never change. But to say that I love YOUR attention is a bit of a stretch, don't you think?
Dialogue||Now that I think about it, this is a mistake.
Dialogue||Come on, it will be fun!
Dialogue||Whatever floats your boat, sewer rat. You would have just bored me, anyway.
Dialogue||We <i>did</i> have fun last time, so let's give it another go! Meet me in front of my apartment at 5:00 pm tomorrow.
Dialogue||I don't know - I think I've got a shot!
Dialogue||I don't care what you think of me.
Dialogue||Oh no, you've gone completely delusional. I would call you a doctor if I only cared at all.
Dialogue||Hah! It's painfully obvious that you care what I think of you. Has anyone ever told you that you're a terrible liar?
Dialogue||Bold choice of colors, I love to see people take risks.						
Dialogue||Sometimes I just reflect on my life and I wonder, how exactly did it end up so perfect?																																																																													
Dialogue||I'm going to be super tall one day soon!							
Dialogue||Hello again. How's your day? I just got out of a session with a client, myself.
Dialogue||What did you and your client talk about?
Dialogue||How many people do you work with in Sun Haven?
Dialogue||Now that I can never tell you! Sorry, XX. It's really nothing personal, but I can not discuss clients with other people. It's all very private, you know.[]I apologize if it comes off as strict, but I take that part of my job incredibly seriously.
Dialogue||Hm, well that's something I think would be okay to answer.[]I work with lots of people, to put it broadly. Some of my clients I see weekly, but some I've only see once or twice as they work through an issue.[]It doesn't matter how often they need me, though. I'm always here for whenever they do.
Dialogue||I understand, don't worry about it.
Dialogue||Boring. I wanna hear the juicy details.
Dialogue||Thank you. You won't believe how pushy some people can be about wanting to know who I talk to and about what![]Heh, people are just naturally curious, though.
Dialogue||I understand you might be curious, XX, but I can not violate a client's privacy. I admit I'm a bit disappointed you'd even ask...
Dialogue||Where do you find the time to make it all work?
Dialogue||Your schedule must be all over the place.
Dialogue||Sometimes I'm not even so sure! But it's all part of what I do. I have to find time for a client if I want to help them, after all.
Dialogue||It's true, I have a bit of a messy plate most of the time. But it's worth it, in order to accommodate everyone.
Dialogue||Yes, this is my natural hair color. Why does everyone ask me that? Catherine's hair is way more colorful!
Dialogue||Don't stare too long at my snakes, they get agitated.			
Dialogue||The most potent magic of all? Romance.										
Dialogue||If you think you belong here, you're in for a rude awakening.																																																																						
Dialogue||So, what do you think? Am I a good husband so far?
Dialogue||It's barely been any time at all!
Dialogue||Where is this coming from?
Dialogue||I know, but I'm just trying to make sure I start on the right foot.
Dialogue||Well, I don't know. I've never been so involved with another person before. I guess I'm just feeling a little pressure now that we're married.
Dialogue||Do husbands worry too much? Because you're great at that.
Dialogue||You've got two right feet, Wornhardt.
Dialogue||Ouch, message received. I guess I won't bug you with my silly worries anymore.
Dialogue||What? That's not true... oh, I get it! Hah, that took me a sec. That's sweet of you, XX. Thanks for trying to cheer me up.
Dialogue||You're a doctor - all your work is done under pressure!
Dialogue||Don't try so hard. Just relax!
Dialogue||Heh, good point. I'm probably just dwelling on it too much.
Dialogue||I wonder how many more people can fit inside this city? Hopefully, a lot!																																																																																																																	
Dialogue||You got a thought bouncing around up there? Or did you just forget how to blink?
Dialogue||I was just looking at the trees. Why are all the trees around here dead, anyway?
Dialogue||Have you been busy around here?
Dialogue||Sorry XX, there are some things you'll have to ask the king himself. That question is one of them.
Dialogue||Not too busy. Withergate basically runs itself these days. Sure, I still sit on the council, but it's not nearly as busy as when I oversaw the city's construction.[]Back then, I felt like a real boss! Now I just help the king with boring jobs.
Dialogue||Why?
Dialogue||So you don't know the answer either.
Dialogue||I'm just not authorized to talk about it. I don't usually follow other people's rules, but King Minos is just about the only person in this town I defer to. So go ask the king if you want to know.
Dialogue||You should feel honored to work with the king.
Dialogue||If you're bored, I guess that means you're good at your job.
Dialogue||Have you been talking to Darius? That sounded just like one of his lines. Which I don't buy for a second, by the way.
Dialogue||Hm, good point. I suppose there are worse things than that. Thanks XX, that was actually helpful.
Dialogue||Wherever you come from, you've found home now. Trust me, you'll never want to leave this place.												
Dialogue||Sorry if I'm out of breath... I've been running around town all day.																																																																													
Dialogue||I spent my living days hard at work, sweating in the sun and getting my hands dirty.					 					
Dialogue||Hello there, farmer. Is everyone calling you farmer now? I could just call you XX if you prefer.[]So... oh, did you want to talk?
Dialogue||Are you from Sun Haven, Liam?
Dialogue||What do you think about the Withergate rumors?
Dialogue||No, I moved here from the north. "The old and cold north."[]That's, um, what they call it. In the north. Because it's so cold there.[]Anyway, I'm glad to be out of the north. The girls and I really just needed somewhere warmer, both in temperature and community.
Dialogue||I'm not sure what to think, so I just try not to think about it at all. If something happens, I'm sure the army will have it under control. Probably.
Dialogue||Moving must have been hard on the girls.
Dialogue||You made the right call bringing them here.
Dialogue||It was, but we had to do it. I hope you don't think I'm a bad brother because of that.
Dialogue||I'm always doubting my decision, so a little affirmation goes a long way right now... thanks, XX.
Dialogue||It's lucky that the army is in Sun Haven.
Dialogue||Are you glad the army is here?
Dialogue||Sure it's impressive and safe and stuff, but it kind of freaks me out more than if they weren't here at all.
Dialogue||You've got a faraway look, XX. Is there something you want to talk about?
Dialogue||I'm thinking about our future.
Dialogue||Heh, it's kind of funny to hear you refer to our future, together. Maybe I'm still getting used to being in a relationship like this.
Dialogue||I don't know how I could be happier... Are you really worried about this?[]XX, that's ridiculous! You have no reason to worry about me. I expect to be with you for a long time. Heck, maybe forever.
Dialogue||I hope we aren't moving too fast for you.
Dialogue||It's cute that you're still adjusting.
Dialogue||Absolutely not! Trust me XX, I'll let you know if I get really uncomfortable.
Dialogue||Aw, come on! Don't embarrass me in public, XX, or people might think I'm too soft.
Dialogue||Would you like that?
Dialogue||I don't know if I could do <i>anything</i> forever.
Dialogue||Oh! Heh, I didn't mean to say that so directly, but... Honestly, I would![]I don't want to rush you though. Just know that whenever you're ready, XX, then I am too.
Dialogue||Is that so? Well, maybe we've finally found the difference between us. As a soldier, commitment is no stranger to me.
Dialogue||XX, you're looking strong. That's good. I don't want the citizens to think that I waste my time with weaklings.
Dialogue||I've noticed people around town talking about us.
Dialogue||You used to think of me as a weakling, you know.
Dialogue||I'm the prince, of course people will talk. Let them. What have they got to say?[]I know it's unfamiliar to you, but you belong to an exalted class now, XX. You're above the common folk. One of the elites.
Dialogue||That's true. Rarely, people can surprise you and rise above their position in society.[]However, you're one of a kind, XX. I don't expect to find another like you.
Dialogue||I don't like thinking that way. I'm not better than other people.
Dialogue||I'm finally where I belong - next to you.
Dialogue||But XX, you are. No matter. You will eventually learn to embody your privilege soon enough. 
Dialogue||I can't wait to rule with you at my side. The legacy we create together will be unprecedented.
Dialogue||I'm grateful that you can see my strength now.
Dialogue||It's all because you gave me a chance.
Dialogue||Thank goodness I had the patience not to lock you away immediately upon arrival. I really came close, you know!
Dialogue||Thank goodness I had the patience not to lock you away upon arrival. I really came close, you know!
Dialogue||Did you feel that? It was like a warm breeze suddenly rushed over me, all when I saw you.																									
Dialogue||Hi! You're our new neighbor!
Dialogue||What's something funny about your brother Liam?
Dialogue||Do you like it in Sun Haven?
Dialogue||Funny? Like how Liam makes funny faces at us when we go to bed?
Dialogue||Sun Haven is fun. I play with Topi and Pod at school. Mister Jun gives us candy when we do good!
Dialogue||Is he good at making faces?
Dialogue||Does that make you sleepy?
Dialogue||He makes the best funny faces!
Dialogue||Only when we're done with laughing. Sometimes we laugh a loooong time!
Dialogue||I bet you get lots of candy.
Dialogue||Candy is bad for you.
Dialogue||I do!! Hehehehe.
Dialogue||Nuh-uh, you just want my candy for yourself. I'm telling Liam that you want to take my candy away!
Dialogue||Good day, XX!						
Dialogue||Sometimes I forget where I am... but it comes back to me sooner or later.								
Dialogue||Most people don't realize that being a parent is a full-time job all on its own.																																																																																																													
Dialogue||You're doing great work, XX. Keep it up and you'll be where I'm at one day.																		
Dialogue||Sun Haven is so warm in the spring! Warm days make me want to curl up and nap alllll day long!
Dialogue||If you nap all day, who will manage the pet shop?
Dialogue||It does get pretty warm here in the spring.
Dialogue||Nya! Sometimes I wish I had no responsibilities, but then I remember someone has to take care of all the cute little pets!
Dialogue||Lots of sunny, sunny days in sunny, sunny Sun Haven! "Sun" is in the name after all, nya! Rain is nice, too, but it makes Kitty's ears and tail all wet!
Dialogue||The pets are lucky to have someone so dedicated.
Dialogue||Well, I hope you never forget.
Dialogue||Aw, you really mean that, XX? Kitty loves all the cute little animals. I would never abandon them! Just because it's warm doesn't mean Kitty HAS to nap!
Dialogue||Nya?! Kitty would <i>never</i> do something like that! XX must have lost their marbles! Just because it's warm doesn't mean Kitty HAS to nap!
Dialogue||Do you ever nap when it rains?
Dialogue||Where's your favorite place to nap? 
Dialogue||Why would Kitty waste a rainy day like that?! When it rains, all the lil' worms come up out of the ground and then all the little birdies try to get 'em! It's so fun to watch![]That's why warm days are best for napping!
Dialogue||Oooh, good question! Sometimes Kitty likes to nap in a tree, or by Catherine's birdie bath! I tried to nap with the little chickie-chickens once, but it... didn't go so well, nyan...
Dialogue||It's strange, I've never been in a relationship before. But now I have you. It's nice.
Dialogue||You've never been in a relationship?
Dialogue||Does being part of a couple make you nervous?
Dialogue||No... Should I be embarrassed by that? Maybe I shouldn't have said anything.
Dialogue||I'm not nervous, but maybe a little uncertain. I don't really know what I'm supposed to do.
Dialogue||No, I'm glad you shared with me.
Dialogue||Don't be embarrassed.
Dialogue||Oh, good. I should have known that you wouldn't make me feel bad about it. I can really count on you, XX.
Dialogue||Honestly, I'm not. I never feel bad in any way around you.
Dialogue||Can't you just relax?
Dialogue||Don't worry about that. Just be yourself.
Dialogue||That's what I'm saying. I try, but it doesn't come so naturally to me. Just don't blame me when I let you down, XX.
Dialogue||Heh, myself. I've been trying to avoid myself for so long. But maybe you're right. I'll be myself... with you.
Dialogue||Have you been doing well, XX?																									 																																																										
Dialogue||Books are the most important inventions ever made by people. Society couldn't advance without storytelling.
Dialogue||You know, I used to visit Sun Haven a lot. Your farm is quite beautiful.
Dialogue||When did you do that?
Dialogue||Why did you visit Sun Haven?
Dialogue||I've always like keeping an eye on things around the forest, but I didn't start visiting the farm until it was abandoned. It was so beautiful when it was overgrown.
Dialogue||In part, it just came from me practicing my magic. I simply needed space to fly, and the sky over Sun Haven is nice and clear.[]But then I began paying attention to the people down there. I guess I became sort of infatuated with the town. Human lives are interesting to me.
Dialogue||So you think it's ugly now that I've farmed it?
Dialogue||It did look nice that way.
Dialogue||No no! That's not what I meant at all.[]Once again, it seems like we're speaking on different levels.
Dialogue||Ah, but don't misunderstand me. It looks great with you on it - I mean, with the work you've done. You've made it more charming than ever.
Dialogue||What's interesting about it?
Dialogue||Do you get infatuated often?
Dialogue||I can't say exactly. It's so different from Nel'Vari, but the people still seem happy. Anyway, I can't help what interests me. That's just nature, and it's the Elven way not to interfere with nature.
Dialogue||Ah! Heh, XX, you caught me by surprise with that one. I can't help what interests me. That's just nature, and it's the Elven way not to interfere with nature.
Dialogue||What to eat for dinner?? Mmmm... fish!																																															
Dialogue||Would you believe that I was Human once?			 					
Dialogue||Do you think plants know when we're talking about them? That might make for an interesting experiment...												
Dialogue||Oh, XX, just seeing you calms me down.									
Dialogue||Why do you smell like... dirt and Humans?																																																																					
Dialogue||Hey, XX. You're an honest person, right? Well, do I... stink?
Dialogue||You want me to smell you?
Dialogue||What in the world makes you ask?
Dialogue||Yeah, yeah. Just, uh, you know. Take a good whiff of me. What do I smell like to you? 
Dialogue||Look, us wolf Amari have excellent senses of smell. Like right now, I can smell the dirt on your boots. It's actually nice, one of the things I love about you, really.[]But I have been informed, incorrectly, that I <i>smell</i> like I live in a sewer. But if I don't smell it, then there's no way it's true! Which it definitely isn't.[]I try not to care what others think of me, but I can't stand it when they say something that isn't true.
Dialogue||You smell like Donovan to me.
Dialogue||You sort of stink.
Dialogue||See! I knew I didn't stink! 
Dialogue||You mean I stink good, or I stink bad? I'm okay with stinking good, but please tell me I'm not stinking bad... 
Dialogue||Whoever it was, just ignore them.
Dialogue||You have to stop letting it get to you.
Dialogue||Heh. Sure, you're right. Helps to hear you feel the same way, though.
Dialogue||I wanted some support from a friend, not a lecture. Nevermind, I shouldn't have asked in the first place.
Dialogue||Everyone in Nel'Vari has their mind on the forest, but all I can think about lately is you, XX.												
Dialogue||You're the new neighbor? Welcome to town.
Dialogue||I'm XX, nice to meet you.
Dialogue||My name's Camila. Oh, and nice meeting you too.
Dialogue||Nobody knows the soldier's code of conduct better than I do.				
Dialogue||Ah, XX. There are days when I simply need to look into your face to calm myself down.
Dialogue||Has it been a rough day?
Dialogue||Do you really feel calm just by looking at me?
Dialogue||Xyla and Cordelia can't stop arguing about where to place a new water feature. I fear it will never see the light of the moon at this rate. 
Dialogue||Hah! You love drawing compliments out of me, don't you? Fine, fine.[]Yes, XX. The sight of your face dispels all unwanted distractions from my mind. It's something I noticed about you early on, actually. 
Dialogue||They must really care about it.
Dialogue||Isn't one of them in charge of the other?
Dialogue||I'm not so sure. In truth, I sometimes think they fight with each other simply to assert dominance.[]They both hold an equal position next to my father, you see, but neither of them can settle for that. So instead, they fight like children.
Dialogue||Actually, they both hold an equal position next to my father. But neither of them can settle for that, so instead they fight like children.
Dialogue||So you really liked me from the start??
Dialogue||The sight of you did the same for me, Darius.
Dialogue||As much as I tried not to, I still did. There, now you know. Don't go spreading the word, though. If everyone knew I was a "love at first sight" kind of guy, my reputation would never recover.
Dialogue||Is that so? Even from the beginning? Ah... I was hoping to make you fear me. I must be losing my touch.
Dialogue||Did you do your hair different? Wait, that's just the wind. Let me fix that for you.
Dialogue||Thanks Jun - but my hair will never look as good as yours!
Dialogue||Jun, I'm really enjoying getting to know you better. I think we should go on another date! 
Dialogue||Ah! So you do like my hair after all? I've wondered what you think about it. Don't be afraid to tell the truth - I can take it!
Dialogue||I feel the same way. Talking to you is so easy, I can't explain it.
Dialogue||If you want the full truth, it is a bit much.
Dialogue||I love the style and color. It's perfect for you.
Dialogue||That's what you think? Maybe it's time for a change...
Dialogue||I'm starting to think<i>you're</i> perfect for me, XX.[]Oh, I hope that wasn't too forward!
Dialogue||Then again, maybe a second date is a bad idea.
Dialogue||So that's a yes?
Dialogue||If that's how you feel, I'll respect that. But you should know, that's not how I feel at all.
Dialogue||I won't lie - I've been waiting for our second date ever since our first one ended. I would absolutely love to go out with you again, XX.[]Meet me at my house tomorrow at 5:00 pm, okay? I'll see you there!
Dialogue||Keep an eye out for a shapeshifter, that guy owes me some money.																																																																																																								
Dialogue||Before you ask, no I will not be your mentor. I work too much to be someone's role model!
Dialogue||Is there any role model you look up to?
Dialogue||I'd say you work too much, Anne. What would you even do on a day off?
Dialogue||I've got to respect Lucia's ability as a leader. I don't know how, but she's got this town wrapped around her magic little fingers.[]Other than her? Probably my old mentor. At least, I used to.
Dialogue||Day off, huh? I can't imagine why I'd want a day off. I guess if I had to take a day off, I would spend it on the beach with a whole cheesecake to myself.[]Oh, and at the bottom of the cake is a diamond!
Dialogue||You've never mentioned a mentor before.
Dialogue||I remember you talking about her before.
Dialogue||Actually, I have. Can't expect you to remember everything, I guess.
Dialogue||Actually, my old mentor was a man, but I don't think I told you that. Heck, I'm surprised you remember me mentioning him at all!
Dialogue||Don't you ever want a day off?
Dialogue||Cake on the beach sounds risky. What about the sand?
Dialogue||I don't like days that don't make me any money. Too many days like that and I don't eat.[]A while back, I promised myself that I would never go to bed hungry again. I definitely intend to keep that promise.
Dialogue||XX, if you think a little sand would stand between me and a delicious raspberry cheesecake then you really don't know a thing about me. Besides, I've eaten some nasty food in my time.
Dialogue||It seems Xyla has made a mistake with the castle's plumbing. Completely unacceptable.
Dialogue||Xyla has always served you well, right? What's wrong?
Dialogue||Having trouble running the city?
Dialogue||She's made an error concerning some petty civic scheduling. A rare blunder for her, but an unacceptable one all the same.
Dialogue||Running Withergate is always a challenge. Which is why mistakes are not tolerated, no matter who makes them.
Dialogue||You should take it easier on her.
Dialogue||Well, small mistakes can add up.
Dialogue||Feh! "Take it easy on her?" Mercy is a key ingredient in laziness. Xyla's job is too important to allow her to slip up...[]Today it might be a small blunder, then tomorrow it might be the city's undoing.  
Dialogue||I'm glad you understand, XX. Maybe it makes me harsh, but so what? I'm not trying to be the nicest Demon in Withergate.[]Sometimes the hand that rules must do so... sternly. 
Dialogue||What about the times when you mess up?
Dialogue||Doesn't seem like such a big deal.
Dialogue||Don't you think I hold myself to the same standards? I can't make any mistakes, either. I am prince, soon to be king. Every problem is ultimately my responsibility.
Dialogue||I came to believe you had better foresight, XX. It seems, however, that you merely long for the days when your opinion meant nothing to me. 
Dialogue||That Xyla lady was bothering me earlier today. She kept asking if I'd like a job as a city rat catcher. So annoying!
Dialogue||Why would Xyla be asking you about a rat catcher job?
Dialogue||I bet it pays decent, and it'd be a steady gig.
Dialogue||I mean, don't get me wrong. I love a good rat chase now and then. They're small and quick, so it makes it extra rewarding when you catch one of em'.[]Xyla seems to think I'd be pretty good at it. As like, a real "profession", I mean. Guess the city is having extra trouble with the rats these days, and all.
Dialogue||Maybe. But the last thing I'm worried about is stuff like that. I'd have to work every day, report to some 'boss' and worst of all, I'd be on the prince's payroll![]And all for what? Some extra change in my pocket? I wanna chase rats when I feel like chasing rats, not because it's my obligation. No way.
Dialogue||What do you do with a rat when you catch it?
Dialogue||The idea of you chasing rats is hilarious.
Dialogue||See, that's the thing! I like to let the little guys go. Rat doesn't taste very good, so I see no sense in harming them. Xyla would want me to 'get rid' of the rats, though.
Dialogue||Yeah yeah, big bad Donovan the rat chaser, I know. But don't knock it until you try it. It's all sorts of fun, not to mention good exercise.[]I even let the rats go when I catch them, don't see a point in hurting them. Xyla would want me to 'get rid' of the rats, though.
Dialogue||Keeping the dream alive. I can appreciate that.
Dialogue||A job would give you some possibilities, though.
Dialogue||Heheh, thanks, XX. I knew you'd understand. You're usually working everyday and I can understand that. We're just two different people in that way.[]Cool to have someone who's different, but understands. Rare in this world, for sure.
Dialogue||Ew, a pep talk. No thanks. Maybe some people need those kinds of "possibilities" in their lives, but I sure don't. I thought you of all people knew that. 
Dialogue||Hello. Unless you need something from me, go ahead and grab a book.
Dialogue||Are you from Sun Haven?
Dialogue||How many books have you read?
Dialogue||Yes, I'm a native here. The library was a comfortable place for me when I was a kid. Still is, too.
Dialogue||I don't know. Probably about equal to the number of head injuries you've had.
Dialogue||Was this your dream job as a kid, then?
Dialogue||I don't blame you, libraries are so cozy.
Dialogue||My dream job as a kid was to be a dragon. This was a pretty close second.
Dialogue||And they're usually so quiet too. You know. Usually.
Dialogue||I actually believe that!
Dialogue||You don't have to be rude.
Dialogue||To your credit, you sure know how to take a joke.
Dialogue||And you don't have to distract me.
Dialogue||Dear me... I'm sorry XX, I'm particularly tired today. Topi, Pod, and Kitty ran into one of the traveling merchants' carts and made a huge mess. I spent the morning helping clean it up.
Dialogue||You didn't have to help clean it, you know.
Dialogue||Are you busy for the rest of the day, or can you recouperate?
Dialogue||Believe me, I know. I had those three troublemakers help too, but there was a lot to pick up. To make matters worse, there may still be damage to the cart itself.
Dialogue||Unfortunately, I'm quite busy today. It's no trouble, however - I'm sure I can find some relaxation time later tonight.
Dialogue||What were they doing??
Dialogue||Those kids are always playing, nonstop.
Dialogue||This time they were playing... what was it... "Jump Tag?"[]It sounds like a combination of Leap Frog and Tag. Seemingly, it's a great way to knock over a mining merchant's cart!
Dialogue||Can't you just forget about one meeting?
Dialogue||You make being Archmage look easy.
Dialogue||Oh no, XX. Even if I did that and had the best nap of my life, I would just be that much more behind in my work. I would only end up more stressed and tired later.
Dialogue||Hah! Oh, thank you XX. It doesn't feel that way to me, but thank you. Let's keep up appearances for the rest of the town, shall we?
Dialogue||It's been a long time since someone new has found their way to us. You must be something special, XX.
Dialogue||Those are interesting tattoos.
Dialogue||And what do you do here, Vaan?
Dialogue||Ah, do you like them? The Elder gives us these tattoos himself. They're meant to represent our individual spirits.[]Sometimes they can even start glowing, but only when in a state of deep spiritual activity. I've only seen mine glow once before - the first time I flew on my cloud.
Dialogue||I mostly practice my magic. I've been trying to push my knowledge of wind magic to its limits lately. It's exhausting, to be honest.
Dialogue||Are you less spiritual than other Elves, then?
Dialogue||You must be very spiritual, then.
Dialogue||Hm? Not at all. You must be misunderstanding me, XX. It's a rare thing to see your tattoos glow.[]Aside from the Elder, I might even be one of the most spiritual people in Nel'Vari. 
Dialogue||Aside from the Elder, I might even be one of the most spiritual people in Nel'Vari.[]Ah! I don't mean to sound like I'm bragging. Sometimes my mouth gets ahead of my brain.
Dialogue||How did you learn magic?
Dialogue||You sound pretty advanced.
Dialogue||I was taught by the World Dragon. No one else has the knowledge to train a master of wind magic.
Dialogue||Of course, I trained under the World Dragon herself. No one else has the knowledge to train a master of wind magic.
Dialogue||Hey, XX! You look absolutely radiant today.
Dialogue||You're laying it on pretty thick, eh doctor? 
Dialogue||Hey, why do you have two stethoscopes?
Dialogue||That settles it - it's definitely weird of you to call me doctor now. Let's just stick to Wornhardt, yeah?
Dialogue||Well one is for work, but the other one is for you. I mean, if you want it. It's my old stethoscope that I wanted to give to you as a gift!
Dialogue||I prefer your real name, anyway.
Dialogue||Maybe I'll stick with "Doctor" just to bug you!
Dialogue||We're already on the same page. We'll really make it as a couple after all!
Dialogue||Try to push my buttons all you want, I'm not falling for it. I'm trained to be cool under pressure, remember?
Dialogue||What a thoughtful gift, thanks!
Dialogue||Oh! Why?
Dialogue||This is the first stethoscope I ever had. Without this, I wouldn't be where I am today.[]I used to listen to my own heart with it. It was my way of reminding myself of what I live for. And now you're a part of that reminder, XX. So please keep it close!
Dialogue||For the endless source of inspiration you've given me, I will forever be in your debt.																 																																																										
Dialogue||I asked Liam if we could get a puppy but he got sweaty like when he's nervous.										
Dialogue||Albert is my husband. We've been married 32 years.								
Dialogue||Hi, XX! I'm always happy to see you around town.
Dialogue||Catherine, you're always so cheerful. Does anything make you mad?
Dialogue||Of everyone in Sun Haven, who do you prefer to spend your time with?
Dialogue||I know I seem very cool most of the time, but sometimes I do get fired up. It's usually when I see someone being unfair or cruel to another person.[]I'll admit that I've cast my share of curses over people that I thought deserved it. That was only as a teenager, though.
Dialogue||Lucia and I have always gotten on very well. And believe it or not, I have a lot of fun with Anne. I don't know if she feels the same way, though.
Dialogue||I wish I could do that sometimes!
Dialogue||You can cast curses? Doesn't that mean you practice dark magic?
Dialogue||Oh, good. I was worried you might judge me for that![]Anyway, I've grown up since then. I don't take part in dark practices anymore.
Dialogue||I said it was only as a teenager, didn't I? I've grown up since then, XX. I don't take part in dark practices anymore.
Dialogue||You don't think Anne likes you?
Dialogue||Well, I always end up giving her some lecture about her morals. I used to be more serious about it, but I've started doing it for fun. Now I just like to push her buttons, hehe.
Dialogue||One day, we could be sailing away over the sea together.																																									
Dialogue||You're married now, XX. Does it feel like a big change? 
Dialogue||You're married, too! 
Dialogue||Will our marriage get in the way of your work? 
Dialogue||And for me it feels... strangely natural. I don't know if I believe in fate, but it feels like we belong with each other. Like it was supposed to be this way. 
Dialogue||I thought by now you'd have known not to worry about that. I am an enchanter, but I'm also your wife. I wouldn't have married you if I thought things wouldn't work out.[]You're the same way, right?
Dialogue||It feels like a natural change to me, too.
Dialogue||That sounds silly to me.
Dialogue||See? I knew you felt it, too. It's almost kind of eerie, but in a good way. 
Dialogue||Do you think so? I really thought you would feel the same way, but I've been wrong before. 
Dialogue||I'd give up farming for you, if I had to!
Dialogue||You're right, my work is important to me.
Dialogue||Really?! For me? I never thought you'd do something like that! Oh, now I'm a little guilty for how I felt. You won't hold it against me, will you? 
Dialogue||We both made a smart choice with each other, XX. That's how you can tell our relationship is built to last.
Dialogue||Hello, XX! It's fun having you around Nel'Vari nowadays.[]It reminds me of when I was a kid. More travelers used to come through back then.
Dialogue||Do you have a favorite memory from growing up here?
Dialogue||Iris, I was wondering if you would go on a date with me!
Dialogue||Let me think... There was that time when my friend Angel d'Argy and I climbed to the top of the Grand Tree - and I don't mean the Elder's room, I mean the very tippy-top!
Dialogue||Oh, yeah? Funny, I never thought you would have cared.[]Okay XX, I think it sounds fun!
Dialogue||Isn't that dangerous?
Dialogue||How did you manage to climb that high?
Dialogue||Well it isn't like we were clinging to the bark or anything. There used to be sturdy knots on the Grand Tree that you could climb on to get to the top.[]It was easy when I was little, but I got too big and took a tumble so... I don't try it anymore.
Dialogue||Well it isn't like we were clinging to the bark or anything. There used to be sturdy knots on the Grand Tree that you could climb on to get to the top.[]It was easy when I was little, but I got too big and took a tumble so... I don't try it anymore. 
Dialogue||It's a date!
Dialogue||On second thought, maybe we should just stay friends.
Dialogue||Hehe, you're cute. Come by my house tomorrow, then. Say, 12:00 pm?
Dialogue||Oh, okay. Ha ha. Good one, XX, you got me.
Dialogue||Never approach any member of the elite unless beckoned.
Dialogue||I could go for some noodles...												
Dialogue||Hi XX, I made some really nice armor today! I wish you could have seen it, but Solon already packaged it for shipment.
Dialogue||Sometimes I think I would really enjoy a life like yours. Farming sounds peaceful.
Dialogue||Your time in Sun Haven hasn't been peaceful?
Dialogue||You would make a good farmer, I think.
Dialogue||Good point - I'm not exactly on the front lines of a battle here.[]But there's always that thought in my head. I have to be ready in case of any kind of emergency.
Dialogue||Sure, I could see that. There's honor in a simple life of hard work. Yeah, I could definitely go for something like that.
Dialogue||How do you find peace of mind, anyway?
Dialogue||I'm surprised you still stay so prepared.
Dialogue||I always space out when I'm staring at the ocean. Maybe my sailboat is out there somewhere, waiting for my service to end... That's a nice thought.
Dialogue||I've got to be, XX. I'm Captain, aren't I? What a humiliation it would be to be caught off guard here!
Dialogue||You would probably get too bored, though.
Dialogue||I would love to run a farm with you!
Dialogue||Give me some credit, XX. I don't need excitement every hour of every day. Heck, I've been in Sun Haven for five years without any major incidents.
Dialogue||Maybe one day, we can make that a reality. But for now, I have to fulfill my duty to the army and our people.
Dialogue||I grown to quite enjoy the peace and quiet of the town hall.																																																																			
Dialogue||If you need anything, you know where to find me. Wait, do you know where to find me? You can find me at the bakery.			
Dialogue||I just hope the next generation doesn't forget how to have fun. All I hear is serious talk these days.											
Dialogue||Emma and Elizabeth have been talking about getting a pet... Usually a plushie will get them to forget about it, but not this time.
Dialogue||Don't you want a pet?
Dialogue||Maybe you need a bigger plushie.
Dialogue||I would love a pet if I didn't have to take care of it at all. But my sisters are too young to care for an animal all on their own. I'm sure I would end up doing all the work.
Dialogue||Hm, I think I saw a giant teddy bear in the general store the other day...[]Who am I kidding? We don't have the space for that. I might just need to wait for this to blow over.
Dialogue||You should play it safe to save yourself the headache.
Dialogue||You should trust your sisters with more responsibility.
Dialogue||That's exactly what I was thinking. I just feel so guilty always telling them "no." I guess that's what parenting is like, though.
Dialogue||XX, last week Emma lost her pants. In the middle of the day. One minute they're on her, the next minute they're gone.[]Please don't talk like you know my sisters better than I do, XX. That's just not true.
Dialogue||Keep trying different plushies!
Dialogue||It'll be worth it!
Dialogue||You say that like I'm made of money, XX. I don't exactly account for plushies in my budgeting... but maybe I should?
Dialogue||I don't know, our house is already pretty cramped. Besides, it was a <i>very</i> expensive bear.[]Unfortunately, I'm not made of money. I don't exactly account for plushies in my budgeting... but maybe I should?
Dialogue||I swear that I see you and hear music. Maybe you're my muse, XX.
Dialogue||Muse? What do you mean?
Dialogue||Nonsense, your inspiration is your own.
Dialogue||You haven't heard that term before? It means I draw inspiration from you, XX.
Dialogue||Ultimately, that's true. But it doesn't hurt to have a little outside help, too.
Dialogue||Does that mean vegetables are my muse?
Dialogue||I don't know what's so inspiring about me.
Dialogue||That's not... well, I guess anything could be a muse. But it's usually something a bit more, say, refined.
Dialogue||I don't know either, but that's not important.[]A muse isn't meant to be figured out, it's meant to be a source of creative energy. And you, XX, are overflowing.
Dialogue||I will always help, however I can.
Dialogue||I'm afraid you're using me like a crutch.
Dialogue||All you need to do it be yourself. And you're good at that. Who knows what I'll produce with you around?
Dialogue||Even if I was, would that be bad? I don't see why. I just want to have you around me, all the time.
Dialogue||Keep an eye on your mailbox. You don't want to miss a letter!																																																																																																																																																			
Dialogue||There's no such thing as being too prepared, I say.												 					
Dialogue||Welcome in, farmer. Make yourself comfortable.
Dialogue||Your tavern is so cozy. There's an inn upstairs too?
Dialogue||What's it like running a tavern?
Dialogue||Yep, upstairs too! Where else are weary travelers supposed to put their feet up?
Dialogue||People come in and we take care of them, simple as that. It can be a lot to manage, though. No matter what, our customers always leave full, rested, and happy.
Dialogue||Have you heard any rumors about the monster town?
Dialogue||What kind of travelers do you get?
Dialogue||I've heard rumblings from different folk, especially travelers coming from the north. Hard to make sense of rumors, though.
Dialogue||Folks from all kinds of places. We even get sailors from the Southern Islands sometimes. Sun Haven may have seen better days, but our reputation for trade still draws folks in. 
Dialogue||That's a lot of ruckus. Sounds like annoying work. 
Dialogue||It must be interesting seeing so many different people.
Dialogue||Maybe, but I've learned to enjoy the job and all that comes with it. Sounds like you might not understand, though.
Dialogue||Oh sure, the people make the job. Hearing travelers' stories is a perk of the work.
Dialogue||Do you listen to music, XX? Listening to records is how I got into music to begin with.
Dialogue||What kind of music do you listen to, Claude?
Dialogue||Have you played music for a long time?
Dialogue||I usually listen to stringed instruments. Sometimes I'll draw inspiration from my records.
Dialogue||Music has been a companion to me my whole life, even when nobody else was. It feels like eons now...
Dialogue||I'd love to hear your favorite records, sometime!
Dialogue||Sounds kind of boring. I like loud music.
Dialogue||That's fine with me, but the music I listen to is boring.[]You should ask Arvel at the record store for advice. He has a gift for pairing people with music.
Dialogue||I guess you're not wrong. You should ask Arvel at the record store for advice. He has a gift for pairing people with music.
Dialogue||I think I see why you feel so strongly about your work.
Dialogue||What do you mean by that?
Dialogue||I don't want to get into it right now, but there's good reason that I shoot for perfection in my music. 
Dialogue||I don't want to get into it right now, but there's good reason that I shoot for perfection in my music.
Dialogue||Phew! That sewer water smell sticks around!									
Dialogue||One day I'll finish my training, and I know you'll be there with me, XX.																																						
Dialogue||I'm surprised you're still here.																																																																						
Dialogue||Is it me, or does it seem like just yesterday we were riding the train into town together? Don't say it's just me!
Dialogue||Time has flown since we got here.
Dialogue||I think we've both grown as people.
Dialogue||XX... do you think you'll stay here after all? Or are you just passing through, like any other traveler?
Dialogue||Oh, I agree! XX, it has been an adventure here. I know I've said it before, but I'm truly glad that we started this adventure together! 
Dialogue||I'm going to leave one day.
Dialogue||I'm not going anywhere.
Dialogue||Oh... well, that's your choice. I thought we might stay friends here for a while longer, but you should do what's best for yourself.
Dialogue||Oh, yay! Heh, maybe it's silly but I hate to imagine you leaving. You're the first friend I made here and... well, that's special to me.
Dialogue||You've become a stronger person since then.
Dialogue||I've become a stronger person since then.
Dialogue||Thanks for saying so, XX. Not to get a big head, but I agree! Working with Solon has really shaped me as a blacksmith.[]Honestly - and don't tell him I said this! - at first I thought I would <i>hate</i> Solon for how tough he is as an instructor. But now I've almost made it, thanks to him.
Dialogue||You definitely have! Not to get a big head, but I feel like I've grown the same way too. Working with Solon has really shaped me as a blacksmith.[]Honestly - and don't tell him I said this! - at first I thought I would <i>hate</i> Solon for how tough he is as an instructor. But now I've almost made it, thanks to him.
Dialogue||I don't mind lending assistance, but I am quite busy.
Dialogue||Do you look around when you walk places? I find treasures all the time!																									 																																																																																																													
Dialogue||You have a sparkle in your eye that I can't help but stare into.																					
Dialogue||Sometimes I think of visiting the Northern Region again. Then I think about it some more and... well, I haven't ever gone.																																																																																																					
Dialogue||Hello XX! Oh my, you appear to have gotten a little too much sun. Your cheeks are extra rosey today!
Dialogue||I may have sat a little too close to the fire on our date...
Dialogue||You have such fair skin. How do you keep from getting sunburns?
Dialogue||I was thinking about that. XX, I had a wonderful time with you on our date. I would be delighted to go out again!
Dialogue||I used to get sunburns all the time, but now Catherine gives me a homemade sunblock. It works remarkably well!
Dialogue||I don't think that's a good idea.
Dialogue||I would love that!
Dialogue||Oh dear, my apologies XX. I must have simply misread the situation.
Dialogue||Fantastic! Meet me outside of my house tomorrow night at 5:00 pm. I can't wait, XX!
Dialogue||I assumed it was because of your magic.
Dialogue||Are you saying that Catherine's magic is as strong as yours?
Dialogue||Not everything I do is done magically, you know. Although, Catherine's salves certainly work like magic!
Dialogue||Actually XX, I'm talking about her herbalism practice and not her witchcraft. She makes many helpful potions without relying on any spells! She's quite remarkable.
Dialogue||Oh, I'm just thinking of all the ways I'll make your insolence come back to bite you.
Dialogue||It's a relief to see the town doing so much better these days.																																																																																																																							
Dialogue||Ah, another cave-diving enthusiast? Join the club! That's just a saying, there isn't really a club.																																										
Dialogue||Ahh, the shipment of tombmelon wine has finally arrived. How timely.
Dialogue||Do you enjoy wine?
Dialogue||Tombmelon wine? Could I learn to make that?
Dialogue||You were expecting me to drink anything less? For someone of my status, it's either wine or thirst.[]I would never lower myself to anything else. So to say I "enjoy" wine is a wild understatement.
Dialogue||I'm sure you might be an eager cook, XX, but this is something you'll never learn to make. The recipe is known only to Withergate's royal vintners.[]It is a drink of Demon royalty, as it has been for one thousand years and shall be for countless thousands more.
Dialogue||I would expect as much from you.
Dialogue||You have such a refined taste.
Dialogue||You've learned much about me, XX. Maybe the most important thing you've learned is to never question what I say.[]Come to think of it, it's definitely the most important thing. 
Dialogue||This wine must be very important to your family.
Dialogue||Wine from a melon sounds pretty weird, anyways.
Dialogue||There are two worlds, XX. My family and our allies live in one, and everyone else lives in the other. We are separated by a fundamental culture.[]From how we dress, how we speak and even what we eat and drink. That is the difference between you and I. You do not have to understand it, but you will have to recognize it.
Dialogue||You've the taste of a low-born, XX. Your opinion on the subject is irrelevant. 
Dialogue||They say I'm the best smith in the four regions. Not like I'm going to argue.				
Dialogue||You look spry. In my youth, I was an unmatched gymnast. Really, that's true!								
Dialogue||Since we've been together, I've been thinking of you constantly. I'm even starting to picture our future together!
Dialogue||You're looking at me funny...
Dialogue||Something I've been wondering - does it bother you that I'm just a farmer?
Dialogue||I'm just excited![]XX, I have something for you. It's a gift. I want you to keep it with you always, okay?
Dialogue||Oh, you're so adorable. It doesn't matter what your job is - I don't mind one bit. All that matters is that <i>you're</i> happy with your job... and with me.
Dialogue||What is it?
Dialogue||I promise to keep it safe. 
Dialogue||It's my journal where I keep all my thoughts and ideas - please take it! Consider it my way of sharing my thoughts with you.
Dialogue||You always put me at ease, Jun.
Dialogue||I feel the same way - I don't care about your work either.
Dialogue||I'm always here if you need an ear.[]That's a little rhyme I say to my clients. Isn't it cute?
Dialogue||Well, it sounds a bit different to say that you don't care...
Dialogue||How do you like it here?
Dialogue||What do you like to do for fun here?
Dialogue||Sun Haven's a fine town. I moved here a few years ago since houses were affordable. Saved me a lot of money!
Dialogue||I just enjoy the town. I don't like big city life, but walking around Sun Haven is perfect. Even the guards are nice to talk to. Except for Calvin...
Dialogue||It sounds like you don't actually care that much for Sun Haven.
Dialogue||It's lucky you moved here at the right time, then.
Dialogue||Don't jump to conclusions.
Dialogue||It was luckier than you think - I would have been homeless if not for this place.
Dialogue||What's wrong with Calvin?
Dialogue||I agree, Sun Haven feels like the perfect size.
Dialogue||Have you spoken to him? He's a major downer.
Dialogue||Whoever planned the city must have put a lot of thought into it!
Dialogue||Why is it that everyone insists on talking to me when I go out?
Dialogue||I imagine you must have met almost everyone in town by now. I hope you're getting along well!
Dialogue||Do you hang out with people when you're not working?
Dialogue||Citizens aside, who do you think is the best guard in town?
Dialogue||Of course! In truth, those are the only times when I feel like a citizen of Sun Haven and not just its leader.[]I love to hear Nathaniel and Roza's bantering. I grew up with Catherine, so we know each other quite well. Kitty is rather energetic, but she means well. Actually, the same can be said of Anne.[]I try my best to get to know my citizens. I don't always have time for everyone, but I cherish the time I do get.
Dialogue||Such a divisive question could start a squabble, you know. However... between just you and me, Sophie excels as a soldier.[]Please don't tell anyone I said so, as I would hate to discourage the soldiers protecting our town.
Dialogue||This might be the most excited I've seen you. It's very sweet!
Dialogue||A leader should keep some distance from her citizens.
Dialogue||You're very sweet, XX. I'm happy you've decided to join our family. As far as I'm concerned, that's exactly what Sun Haven is - one big family![]I know that's a cliche, but some cliches are true!
Dialogue||I won't apologize for being passionate about my friends here. That's what I love most about being Archmage - I get to know everybody!
Dialogue||I won't tell anyone that you're playing favorites!
Dialogue||I was going to say the same thing!
Dialogue||Oh, shush! I know you're joking, but I really don't want to hurt anyone's feelings.
Dialogue||That's quite enough gossip for now. As I said, I do not want to hurt anyone's feelings.
Dialogue||Life is weird. It feels like no time at all has gone by since we moved here, but it's already been years.
Dialogue||What are your future plans?
Dialogue||Do you think fate brought you here?
Dialogue||Future plans? Sheesh, I have trouble planning dinner. I'm just taking everything one step at a time right now. If I had to make a whole life plan, I might black out.
Dialogue||Fate? Wow, big question. I don't know if I even believe in fate.[]Then again, it's hard for me to think that things just happen for no reason. So maybe I do believe in fate... What do you think?
Dialogue||Don't you think it's important for your sisters that you make a plan?
Dialogue||Sometimes we have to take life as it comes, and that's okay!
Dialogue||Oh. Maybe? I hadn't thought about that.[]Maybe I bit off more than I could chew by trying to raise them. Am I a bad brother?[]Oh, I wonder if Jun has availability today...
Dialogue||Wow, for a moment it felt like I was in a session with Jun. For some reason you're really easy to talk to.
Dialogue||Everything is a coincidence and nothing happens on purpose. 
Dialogue||I think everything happens for a reason.
Dialogue||Wow, XX. You really, uh, lay it all out there. I can admire your certainty, that's for sure.
Dialogue||Yeah, yeah exactly. Even if it's not true, it's a comforting thought.
Dialogue||Is it just me, or is the air sweeter these days?																																																				
Dialogue||I knew great things were in store for Sun Haven. I just didn't expect them for myself, too!																																	
Dialogue||You're the new neighbor Lucia told me about? I'm Tonya, glad to meet you.
Dialogue||Good to meet you too! I'm XX.
Dialogue||You're living on the farm, right? I'm the town's courier, so I'll be delivering your mail there.
Dialogue||You look like a real go-getter. It's good that the old farm fell to someone like you.
Dialogue||Do you know who owned the farm before me?
Dialogue||Sure do, they were a workhorse too. Also, a dear friend to Judith and me. He left out of the blue about ten years ago.
Dialogue||I'm a knight of the Queen's court, of course!
Dialogue||It's tough when friends leave.
Dialogue||That seems questionable.
Dialogue||Yes, it is.[]Thanks for talking, farmer. Not everyone has time for us old geezers in this fast-paced world, heh.
Dialogue||I would never question that man's honor. He was as decent as anyone.
Dialogue||Wait, what queen? 
Dialogue||No way, that's so exciting! 
Dialogue||Just a joke, youngster. I laid my sword up some time ago. Besides, Sun Haven never even had a queen!
Dialogue||Hey there sweetie-pie, what can we get ya today? 
Dialogue||What's good to eat here, anyway?
Dialogue||Actually, I was wondering how long you've run this tavern.
Dialogue||Oh you can't make a wrong choice. Ronald and I make mean meals and refreshin' drinks, either way. Menu's up at the counter if your stomach's grumblin'.
Dialogue||Oh you sweet thing, did you really come by just to chat? Bless your heart.[]Ronald and I renovated it... oh, must've been nearly twenty years ago now. Time sure flies!
Dialogue||It smells great in here, I'm sure the food is delicious. 
Dialogue||Those drinks really do look good. 
Dialogue||Order up at the counter whenever you're ready, hun. And don't feel shy around the tip jar now!
Dialogue||Well, order up at the counter whenever you're ready hun. We'll take care of ya, and don't feel shy around the tip jar now!
Dialogue||No wonder it looks so old.
Dialogue||You two have been incredibly successful!
Dialogue||Now XX, you might be mistakin' that for a compliment but that's now how I'm takin' it...
Dialogue||Don't sound so surprised, hun! You seen us here firsthand, workin' our magic.
Dialogue||This ring is easily the most expensive thing I own.																																																																																															
Dialogue||I hope my mouse Charlie isn't a problem for you. I think he'd like you!															
Dialogue||I had fun with my barn animals this morning! I wish you saw, XX. They're so snuggly...
Dialogue||By the way, why do you love animals so much?
Dialogue||What's your dream pet, Kitty?
Dialogue||They're so sweet and funny. And did you know each one has their own unqiue personality? Plus plus, I can talk as much as I want and they don't leave as long as I have food for them.
Dialogue||Ooooh, dream pet? XX, that's a tough tough question... No it's not! A White Lion would be my top top choice.[]White Lions are majestic and fast and strong - just like me! Except, maybe stronger... and a loooot bigger.
Dialogue||You really think of them as friends, huh?
Dialogue||It sounds like you treat them very well!
Dialogue||Aw, of course! What else would they be? They're some of my best friends, nya!
Dialogue||Are you sure you could handle a White Lion?
Dialogue||You would be the perfect friend for a White Lion!
Dialogue||If anyone can, it's Kitty. No doubting, XX!
Dialogue||Yes, friend! Exactly! XX, you really really understand my relationship with animals. Maybe that's why we have such a good relationship too!
Dialogue||Some people hate the feeling of dirt underneath their fingernails. Me? I love it.																																																																																																																								
Dialogue||Who knows? One of my gifts could change your life forever.										
Dialogue||Hey, don't you ever think it's a little crazy?[]I mean, that we met each other on the train to our new lives in Sun Haven. And now here we are, together like this. Do you think it was fate?
Dialogue||Fate or not, I'm glad I'm with you.
Dialogue||I don't know if I believe in fate, either, but I think it's very romantic. We were both the town newcomers. For some people, that's a really hard thing to adjust to.[]For you and me, though, it was the start of all of this!
Dialogue||I'm happier than I ever thought I could be. With you, with Sun Haven, with my job. No matter how much I sometimes miss home, I'm so happy I'm here.[]When I first came to Sun Haven I wasn't sure if I'd be here for longer than a few years. Now, I don't want to think of ever leaving. Especially leaving you, XX.[]...When I think of the future, it's you on your farm and me... as your wife, XX!
Dialogue||Maybe it really was fate that put us on the same train.
Dialogue||I'll never forget the train we met on, at any rate.
Dialogue||Heheh, either fate or good timing! Maybe we'll never know for sure, but that's okay, XX. We're together now.
Dialogue||Me either. I was still so nervous that day. Meeting you helped me feel a lot easier, so maybe it was only natural we bonded so well. It's still romantic, though!
Dialogue||I see.
Dialogue||I see the same thing.
Dialogue||Maybe you don't feel the same way right now? It's okay, XX. I'm going to be here for you, as soon as you do.
Dialogue||Oh, XX, I don't even know what to say right now!! I won't rush you... just try and surprise me, okay?!
Dialogue||You again! Well met. Care for a spot of conversation?
Dialogue||Where were you before you came here?
Dialogue||I haven't seen many spirits before.
Dialogue||Before I met my fate in Withergate, I lived in a quaint Human town. Actually, I wasn't even a true knight! I only donned the armor for a journey which turned out to be my last.
Dialogue||I'm not surprised - it's not everywhere we can exist like this. Keeping a spirit form is hard work! Withergate's darkness makes it much easier, however.
Dialogue||Not a real knight? No wonder you ended up here.
Dialogue||You're very jolly considering the circumstances.
Dialogue||I would argue with you, but I may not have much footing to do so.
Dialogue||I've always believed that everything happens for a reason and you can't control all that happens to you. Thinking like that, it's easy to keep high spirits.[]Hah! Get it? Spirits!
Dialogue||So what happens if you can't keep your form? 
Dialogue||Have you tried keeping your form in another town? 
Dialogue||I disappear into the ether forever.[]Only joking! Haha, the look on your face! No, I simply can't interact with the world. I've been told that I slip into another plane of existence, but I don't know much about that. 
Dialogue||Oh certainly, I've tried. It knocks me on my behind, I can tell you that. Last time I was on a road out in the sunshine, I couldn't hold my shape for more than a minute. 
Dialogue||I found a anthill under the tree over there. I want to show Emma!
Dialogue||Are you good friends with Emma?
Dialogue||You should ask Liam if she can come over.
Dialogue||Yeah! Except her brother Liam doesn't let her play as much as me and Topi. I wish we were neighbors too.
Dialogue||But then Elizabeth will come over too. Topi has a crush on Elizabeth and then he doesn't play with me. I hate it!
Dialogue||Do you see her in school?
Dialogue||You think she would like the anthill?
Dialogue||Yes, but we don't get to look at anthills in school.
Dialogue||Yeah I know it! She likes bugs and cool stuff like that.
Dialogue||Think of it this way - then you get more time to play with Emma.
Dialogue||You need to let him play with Elizabeth too.
Dialogue||I guess so. Emma is fun too. Sometimes she brings breads that her brother made and they taste sweet!
Dialogue||Nooooo... Why is everything so hard?
Dialogue||How's the farm treating you, XX? I can't imagine the labor of keeping up a farm!
Dialogue||Why were you wondering about my farm?
Dialogue||You work pretty hard, too.
Dialogue||Oh, come now, don't give me that look! I'm not <i>always</i> trying to get something from you. I like to chat, too.
Dialogue||Sure, but I've come a very long way from doing any of my own dirty work. You're out there everyday, working in the dirt.[]Truth be told, the only physical labor I want to do is counting my money.
Dialogue||Sometimes it's hard to tell with you.
Dialogue||I've learned to play it safe with you.
Dialogue||Is that so? Good! I try to keep people on their toes. I don't want people thinking they've figured me out, because then they think they can haggle with me.
Dialogue||Sounds like you've found your true calling.
Dialogue||On second thought, you sound kind of lazy.
Dialogue||That's true, this is who I am. And I wouldn't change that for anything, not even a mountain of gold. 
Dialogue||Well that's the funny thing about thoughts. You can have as many of them as you like, but it doesn't mean they're any good. 
Dialogue||Maybe I could really start thinking about a pet for Emma and Elizabeth now that we're married.																																																												
Dialogue||Maybe I'll go to the beach today.			 					
Dialogue||It's my favorite outsider! Heh, just kidding. You're a real local by now.[]Something on your mind?
Dialogue||You never talk about family. Have you got any family in town?
Dialogue||Donovan, have you ever been in a serious relationship?
Dialogue||My family has been out of the picture for a while... But not like that! No, they're alive. I mean, I assume they're alive. They just live far away from here.
Dialogue||The longest relationship I've ever had was with an old friend named Addy.[]It wasn't romantic or anything, I just owed them a lot of money.
Dialogue||If they saw you now, I bet they'd be proud.
Dialogue||Don't you want to see them?
Dialogue||That's a nice thing to say, XX. I'm starting to think you really are a great friend - and not just as a joke!
Dialogue||Funny, you kind of sound like them. It's making my feet itch!
Dialogue||Did you pay them back?
Dialogue||That's not exactly what I meant...
Dialogue||Sort of. I saved their life when a crate almost fell on top of them, knocked 'em out of the way. Crate was full of gemstones though, so we split the gems and called it even. 
Dialogue||Hey, that really is the most serious relationship I've been in. You asked, I answered. That's all I can do!
Dialogue||Reading tea leaves is fun, but my favorite part is drinking the tea!																																																																																																																																																			
Dialogue||Don't worry about interrupting my work, it's not going anywhere.																																																
Dialogue||It feels like my life is really coming together. You're a big part of that, XX.
Dialogue||Lynn, I love you, but... 
Dialogue||You know, sometimes I wonder if I should have chosen a different profession.
Dialogue||But what? Don't keep me in anticipation, XX!
Dialogue||Oh, sweet XX. When I started my apprenticeship, I was terrified! You remember, right? I constantly doubted my choice to move here.[]Now I'm almost at the end of my apprenticeship and I've learned almost everything Solon has to teach. What I'm trying to say is, just give it some time, sweetheart.
Dialogue||When you come home from the forge, you stink. Real bad.
Dialogue||Would you mind taking a bath after you get home from the forge?
Dialogue||Well good, that's how you know I worked hard all day. I'm glad I stink!
Dialogue||Oh dear, I must smell like a sweat golem after a day's work! I'm glad you mentioned it, XX. I'll make sure to wash up when I get home.
Dialogue||That's not the same. I'm not a blacksmith.
Dialogue||I don't know what I'd do without you, sweet pea.
Dialogue||XX... I know you'll understand soon.
Dialogue||Oh stop, you'd be just fine on your own. And me, too. In a way, that's what makes us such a strong couple.
Dialogue||You're lucky you get to play on a farm all day!
Dialogue||You know that what I do is hard work, right?
Dialogue||You get to play all day too, right?
Dialogue||Sure, but it's fun because you get to play in dirt and mud and stuff too. Right?
Dialogue||It's not the same. When I get too dirty then I get in trouble with my mom.
Dialogue||I try not to get too dirty.
Dialogue||That's right, farming is a lot of fun!
Dialogue||Figures, adults are always so boring.
Dialogue||I knew it! I want to be a farmer too now, just like you, XX.
Dialogue||Your dad doesn't care?
Dialogue||Just clean up before your mom gets home.
Dialogue||He's usually dirty too, hehehe.
Dialogue||Ooh, that sounds like something Pod would say. You're real smart, XX!
Dialogue||You! You're the reason I'm a free man. I owe ya!						 					
Dialogue||Sometimes I feel my witchcraft isn't... up to snuff, compared to the Blessed like Lucia.
Dialogue||Your witchcraft is very useful.
Dialogue||What can someone who's been blessed do that a witch can't?
Dialogue||Heh, thank you, XX. I think so, too. I just sometimes see one who has been blessed and their raw power makes my craft seem so humble in comparison. 
Dialogue||Witchcraft is a lot more reserved than the magic you see someone who's been blessed do.[]We don't shoot fire or conjure lightning, it's more about reading the natural auras of living things. Being in tune with life, and working off of that energy.
Dialogue||You just have to focus on what you're good at.
Dialogue||Even the Blessed feel this way sometimes.
Dialogue||I guess you're absolutely right. I'm usually so confident with my ability, but we all doubt ourselves sometimes, right? Even Lucia must! Thanks for hearing me out.
Dialogue||Maybe you can ask Elios to give you his blessing?
Dialogue||Maybe it's not as flashy, but your witchcraft is still worth appreciating.
Dialogue||I wouldn't want to do anything like that, XX. I don't want to give up who I am. 
Dialogue||I know, and you're right. I guess that's what I really like about it. I don't have to be big and showy, I'm a witch!
Dialogue||Who's that? Say, I don't recognize your face.
Dialogue||My name's XX. I'm the new farmer here.
Dialogue||Oh, the farmer! That's right Lucia told us there was someone moving in there.[]It's good to meet you, my name is Judith.
Dialogue||Seeds that grow without dirt! Plants that pick themselves! ...Trees that grow gems instead of fruit?[]Oh! You scared me, XX!
Dialogue||Are you alright?
Dialogue||You sound like you have some pretty wild ideas.
Dialogue||Sorry about that. I was just lost in thought, I guess. I'm feeling extra-inspired today and my imagination is running wild![]When I really get to thinking big, it's like the rest of the world kind of blurs out. Like I'm really in my own little zone. 
Dialogue||Well, I'm just in a brainstorming phase right now. No idea is a bad one! Well, at least right now. I'll let my imagination run rampant and then weed out the bad ones later.
Dialogue||You don't have to apologize, just be yourself.
Dialogue||You should still pay attention to other people.
Dialogue||Most people seem to find it annoying. The Elder always scolds me about being more aware of myself and others, but I just want to focus on my ideas.
Dialogue||I thought you were different from everyone else in Nel'Vari, but right now you're sadly sounding very much like them. 
Dialogue||"Weed out," hah. I get it. Plants.
Dialogue||So this is where all your grand ideas start.
Dialogue||I wasn't trying to make a pun, I guess my self-weeding weeds are still on my mind right now... that reminds me... sunflowers that actually grow little suns![]Like a lamp... Hmmm...
Dialogue||Most of them, anyway. Brainstorming is a very turbulent and fun process. Don't worry about plausibility, just come up with anything you can imagine.[]That reminds me... sunflowers that actually grow little suns! Like a lamp... Hmmm...
Dialogue||Some people make their art on canvas or stone, but people wear my art all around town!											
Dialogue||I hope you forgive me when I forget our anniversary...																																																																													
Dialogue||Hiiiii! I'm Kitty! You must be that new farmer in town, nya nya!
Dialogue||That's right, I'm the farmer. My name's XX.
Dialogue||XX, XX! So happy to meet you, nya. 
Dialogue||You should know, the girls are ecstatic about us. In fact, they're a little <i>too</i> excited.[]It was almost impossible getting them to bed last night!
Dialogue||Sometimes even I can't sleep when you're on my mind.
Dialogue||Your sisters are a delight, Liam.
Dialogue||Oh yeah? Heh, I don't really have that problem.[]Not that I'm not excited - I am, very much so! I just mean that sleep usually hits me like a centibeetle. I knock out quick.[]I want you to know that I'm excited about us, but I think I'm making it worse by explaining more. Ah...
Dialogue||You really think so? That's good to hear. I sometimes worry that I'm not bringing them up right.
Dialogue||You're adorable, Liam.
Dialogue||You're making it worse by explaining more.
Dialogue||Huh? Uh, okay! I don't know what I did, but I'm glad that it... worked?
Dialogue||Ugh, I know... Sorry.
Dialogue||I guess time will tell, huh?
Dialogue||With you as their guardian, I'm sure they will be great.
Dialogue||Yeah, I know... sometimes I wish time would hurry up, though!
Dialogue||You always say the right thing, XX. How do you even do that? Seriously, can you teach me? I am... not joking.
Dialogue||My mom gave me a gold coin, but I lost it on the beach... Don't tell!																																																																																																																																																																													
Dialogue||What's that? Oh, yes the carrot in my hat is real. What can I say, I like to have snacks on hand. Or, head!									
Dialogue||Hi, I was just thinking about you today while hammering some armor into shape.[]Oh dear, I hope that doesn't send the wrong message...
Dialogue||You must be doing a lot of hammering - you're looking stronger than you used to.
Dialogue||Did you also make that pauldron on your shoulder?
Dialogue||Do you think so? I always thought my arms were so skinny. My daddy used to call me Twiggy because he said my arms were like little twigs. I never really liked it that much.
Dialogue||This? It was a parting gift from my mother before I moved here. She always makes my armor just a liiittle too big... Oh, I wish I could hug her right now!
Dialogue||Twiggy?? I've got to use that!
Dialogue||That name doesn't really fit anymore.
Dialogue||Oh no - I shouldn't have told you that!! I <i>really</i> don't like that name.
Dialogue||I have gained a little muscle, but I know I'm still quite small. I really do feel stronger, though!
Dialogue||Is your mother working as a blacksmith, still?
Dialogue||Was she worried about your safety?
Dialogue||She did, but now she only smiths for fun. In a way, that makes my pauldron seem even more special!
Dialogue||Oh no, not at all. Most people wear decorative armor back home.[]It's cute that you think this little piece would offer any real protection!
Dialogue||If you want some tips from an expert archer, let me know.												
Dialogue||Whatever you need, I'll be sure to take care of ya.																	
Dialogue||Hey XX, looking good today!									
Dialogue||Having a good day? That's great, please do it quietly.
Dialogue||When we met, I thought you would be good for Sun Haven's future. I never imagined that my own future would change, too!																																	
Dialogue||Hey new neighbor, I want you to know that I've got your back!
Dialogue||Do you always carry a bow with you?
Dialogue||What do you do here, Raimi?
Dialogue||Of course! I have to be prepared, you know. Not everyone in this town knows their way around a weapon, so it will be up to us leaders to protect them in an emergency.
Dialogue||I'm a hunter, so I'm always out in the wilderness. You have to watch your back out there or something nasty might sneak up on you.
Dialogue||What kind of emergency are you expecting?
Dialogue||Don't you think the guards have it under control?
Dialogue||I'm not expecting any one emergency, but I'm prepared for all emergencies.
Dialogue||These guards spend all day lounging in the sunshine. They aren't on my level.
Dialogue||If animals are sneaking up on you, you're probably not a great hunter.
Dialogue||Sounds tricky, you must be very skilled.
Dialogue||Whoa, unexpectedly harsh for a farmer.
Dialogue||You're sharp! My skills are unmatched.
Dialogue||Peter called me a fireball today. Does that sound like a compliment? I can't tell.							
Dialogue||It's almost uncanny how well you fit into Sun Haven. We're all the better for it.																																																																																													
Dialogue||I'm bored lately, XX. Maybe I need a new project to focus on?
Dialogue||What project are you most proud of?
Dialogue||Do you have any goals you're working toward?
Dialogue||I'm so so proud of my dress. I made it to match my ears and tail - can you tell, nya??
Dialogue||Well, since we last talked about it, I'm secretly training to get back in shape like I was when I performed in the carnival. But don't tell, nya! It's between you and me, okay??
Dialogue||Your dress is... unique.
Dialogue||You have a great eye for design!
Dialogue||Huh? Is that it, XX? You don't really like it, nyan...
Dialogue||Ah no, don't say that - I'm just average! You're too too nice to me, XX. Thank you for always making Kitty happy, nya!
Dialogue||Why are you doing that?
Dialogue||Why is it secret?
Dialogue||It makes me better at climbing and jumping, which are two of Topi and Pod's favorite ways to play. I want to show them how good I am!
Dialogue||It's a surprise for Topi and Pod! Sometimes Kitty plays with them, running and jumping. Very very soon I'll be able to show them the best jumps ever!
Dialogue||I'm thinking about my next birthday, I just can't decide what to get my littermates.
Dialogue||Why would you get your littermates something for <i>your</i> birthday?
Dialogue||I didn't know your birthday was coming up.
Dialogue||Oh, well, it's their birthday too. We were all born on the same day, after all! It's tricky since there are seven of them...
Dialogue||Oh, my birthday actually isn't for awhile! But with so many littermates, it takes all year to plan what I'm going to get for everyone.[]I want to go above and beyond so that everyone is happy, but it gets harder each year. I'm really struggling this time!
Dialogue||Your mom had eight kids at once?!
Dialogue||Is that the same for all Amari?
Dialogue||Well, yeah. What do you think a "litter" means, exactly? Some Amari might give birth to a single baby, others will have entire litters!
Dialogue||Nope! Some Amari might give birth to a single baby, while others will have entire litters! 
Dialogue||You could tell them their fortunes!
Dialogue||Yeah, good luck with that.
Dialogue||I love that idea![]Oh, but my littermates don't really like my witchcraft... too many pranks as a kid, hehe.
Dialogue||Right, thanks for all the help... 
Dialogue||Ah, XX! Sorry - I still have some wind up my nose.																																																							
Dialogue||Did you say there's a beach near you? Man, I miss the beach...																																																																																																																										
Dialogue||Hey XX, do you know what I am? I'm the happiest Kitty alive!
Dialogue||What has you so happy?
Dialogue||Is this really the happiest you've ever been?
Dialogue||Don't act like you don't know! You're just teasing Kitty, nya!
Dialogue||Hm, I think so. The only other time I can think of is when I was in the circus. Kitty slipped off her rope and fell very very far to the ground, nyan.[]I thought everyone would be disappointed, but they all cheered for me when I landed on my feet!
Dialogue||I'm only joking, Kitty! 
Dialogue||You think it's fun, too! 
Dialogue||Teehee, I know that! XX is very silly, but very fun too. It's why I love you!
Dialogue||A mistake is nothing to be happy about.
Dialogue||That's amazing, Kitty!
Dialogue||Mm, I disagree! Turning a mistake into a happy moment is a great thing, nya! Maybe you just don't understand?
Dialogue||Because Kitty wasn't hurt? It's normal for me! I fall all the time and haven't been hurt not once, nya!
Dialogue||I think I feel a blister on my foot. I'll have to address it as soon as I can, an infected blister is no good.
Dialogue||Who treats the soldiers when you're wounded?
Dialogue||If you could change something about Sun Haven, what would it be?
Dialogue||Oh, you mean like blisters on the foot? Heh. All of our medical aid is provided by the local hospital, Doctor Wornhardt does a great job with us.[]Thankfully we don't normally need much more than that, though we do have a few soldiers trained as medics. Field medics don't quite have the finesse of a doctor, though.
Dialogue||Hm, that's a pretty big question. Well, let's see...[]I love cozy little Sun Haven, but if there's one thing I miss from my time in the Great City, it's all the roads being stone![]Stone roads are harder than dirt, but much smoother. All these rough dirt roads give me blisters!
Dialogue||I'm glad you all get taken care of.
Dialogue||Using the town doctor seems lazy on the military's end.
Dialogue||Yeah, the military is very generous when it comes to our medical care. It's one of the best things about the army life, actually. I never have to worry about medical bills!
Dialogue||I have no idea why you'd feel that way. Wornhardt is a great physician, and he's entirely local. It makes the most logistical sense for the military to send us his way.
Dialogue||Sun Haven probably isn't big enough to justify paved streets.
Dialogue||Lucia would never agree to budget out paved streets.
Dialogue||Yeah, I've long since given up hope of anything like that. Ah well, blisters are just an occupational hazard.
Dialogue||I've lived in Withergate all my life. That's right, seven long years!														
Dialogue||Got some travelers staying with us tonight. Your usual spread - merchants, adventurers, traveling weirdos. You know how it goes!											
Dialogue||Look sharp, XX! Hah, I'm only kidding. There's no reason to look sharp much these days. Life in Sun Haven has been very ho-hum lately.
Dialogue||What do you do all day if things are so slow?
Dialogue||There's plenty of monsters to fight outside of town.
Dialogue||Well, there's still plenty to do, even if times are peaceful. At any moment there could be danger. Well, theoretically, at least.[]But still, I have rounds to make, training to oversee, schedules to draft... let's see, I do armory count each week, I sign off on supply orders... all sorts of boring stuff, really.
Dialogue||This is true, but admittedly I'm not one to really go out of my way to seek a fight. Still, though, maybe it'd be fun to cut loose and rid the forests of a few dozen monsters.
Dialogue||If it's boring, then why do it?
Dialogue||I never knew you took care of so much stuff.
Dialogue||Just because a task is boring doesn't mean it's not important. I thought a farmer would be the type of person to really understand that.
Dialogue||My plate is often pretty full, I'll say that much. But that's okay! It's my duty, and so it's what I do. Labor now, question later.
Dialogue||Make it a training exercise for your soldiers!
Dialogue||So take a day off and have some fun.
Dialogue||That might not be such a great idea, though. Some of them, like Roza or Sophie, I could trust without ever thinking twice.[]Some of the others, though, may not quite be ready for extreme training like that. Until then, I'll just keep up my busy work, I suppose.
Dialogue||I haven't had a real "day off" since I started academy, and I don't plan to take one anytime soon! My soldiers never get a day off, I could never take one myself.
Dialogue||Pull up a seat, neighbor! Let's have a chat.
Dialogue||So what did you do before the tavern?
Dialogue||When did you learn to cook?
Dialogue||Before this place, I worked construction. Built a lot of houses farther west. It wasn't as fun, but it was good money.
Dialogue||Actually, I taught myself to cook when I was working construction. I used to make lunch for the whole crew![]Eventually I realized I was having way more fun cooking lunch than building houses. The rest is history, as they say.
Dialogue||Wait, does that mean you built this place?
Dialogue||Doesn't this place make good money?
Dialogue||Haha, I wish! I would've done a better job with the seams in the ceiling, I can tell you that much.[]No, I didn't get to build this place. Mari and I renovated it together, though.
Dialogue||The tavern pulls in some gold, but we break even more often than not. That's just how it is until business picks up a bit.
Dialogue||It's lucky you were able to pursue your passion.
Dialogue||Do you think you were helping more people in construction?
Dialogue||You're telling me! Who knows where I would be if I'd stuck with construction?
Dialogue||I help plenty of people right here. I don't need to break my back every day to help out.
Dialogue||You say there's a feline Amari in Sun Haven? I wonder if we would get along...																										
Dialogue||I have friends all over the world, and maybe some enemies too.																																																																																																																																			
Dialogue||Hello, XX. Since you moved in, I've had a good feeling. It's as though Sun Haven is embers, but the wind is kicking up flames.
Dialogue||So what's it like being in charge of Sun Haven?
Dialogue||What are your plans for Sun Haven?
Dialogue||It certainly comes with its challenges. At first, very few people accepted me as leader because I'm so young. I had to earn everyone's support gradually.[]Now, everyone in town looks to me when there's a decision to make.
Dialogue||We're in an uphill battle to revive Sun Haven's economy. It's crucial that we bring more travelers and new shops into town. Every life in Sun Haven depends on my ability to make that happen.[]Still, I'm not worried. Sun Haven has a bright future, and I will be there fanning the flames. Will you help me, XX?
Dialogue||To be fair, you are quite young.
Dialogue||I can't believe anyone doubted you.
Dialogue||I'm well aware, XX. If you have any doubts about me, just give it time. You'll come around.
Dialogue||Well, you did not see my first year as leader. I made my share of mistakes, then.[]Suffice it to say I was incredibly lucky to have Elios guiding me along my path to becoming Archmage.
Dialogue||I'll do whatever I can to help our town.
Dialogue||I'm here for myself. I can't make any promises about the town.
Dialogue||I'm thankful, XX. There's something about you - I can't help but think Sun Haven is better for having you in it.
Dialogue||I suppose I don't blame you, but everyone has to contribute for a community to thrive. I hope you join us, XX.
Dialogue||You know I still think of you as a sewer rat, right?																						
Dialogue||You are fortunate to have earned my friendship.																																																																																																										 									
Dialogue||Oh, XX. You haven't gotten your annual check-up. We should schedule one sometime.
Dialogue||You seem like you're always on top of everyone's wellbeing.
Dialogue||Why would I need an annual check-up?
Dialogue||You mean that as a good thing, right? I am a doctor after all. It's my job!
Dialogue||It's just good to stay on top of things, don't you agree? Especially health. You're always putting your body through the ringer, we should make sure you're in good condition.
Dialogue||It can be a little annoying, but I know it's for my own good.
Dialogue||Sun Haven is lucky to have a dedicated doctor like you.
Dialogue||Heheh. I know it might seem like a doctor nags at you, but trust me. We're in it to help you, it's what we do.
Dialogue||Hey, thanks. That... genuinely means quite a lot to me.
Dialogue||Nah, no thanks, doc.
Dialogue||Sure, pencil me in sometime soon.
Dialogue||I see. Well, I can't force you, though I think your decision is quite unwise.
Dialogue||Great. I'm actually pretty full up right now but it's good to know you take medical appointments seriously. I'll let you know when I have a spot available and we'll get you in.
Dialogue||Is it just me, or is there a little more magic in the air today than usual?
Dialogue||Hi XX. I'm going to play Dragons with Pod!
Dialogue||Your parents trust you to play without them watching?
Dialogue||How do you play?
Dialogue||I guess so. Anyway, Dad usually works on his sculptures outside so he can see me and Pod playing.
Dialogue||First you have to make a dragon - mine is an ice dragon so you can't choose that one. Then, you have a dragon battle!
Dialogue||You must be very responsible for your age.
Dialogue||Is your dad good at watching you?
Dialogue||I guess so. I don't know.
Dialogue||I'll choose... lightning dragon!
Dialogue||I'll choose... fire dragon!
Dialogue||Whoa, cool! Nobody's ever played lightning dragon before!
Dialogue||No fair, you just chose that because I chose ice. You play just like Pod!
Dialogue||I'm already used to seeing you around here, XX. Anyway, what can I do for you? 
Dialogue||What's the best piece of advice you've heard?
Dialogue||Is there anyone in town you don't like?
Dialogue||Best advice ever? Are you in some kind of trouble, XX?[]Heh, I'm just joking. The best advice I ever got was to talk to as many people as I can. Making friends can open a lot of doors for you.
Dialogue||I don't want to talk down on anyone, but since you asked... Peter can be a real handful some nights. He'll cause a ruckus if he gets too happy.
Dialogue||I try to talk to everyone I can.
Dialogue||I don't like talking to people much.
Dialogue||A socialite like me, huh? You'll do just fine for yourself here, XX.
Dialogue||No? Then that's how we're different. Talking to people is all I do, all day long!
Dialogue||Have you had any problems with him? 
Dialogue||That makes sense to me. 
Dialogue||There was one night he broke a stool after he said he could balance it on his head. Yeah, he couldn't.[]He came back and paid for the damage the next day, so it was fine in the end.
Dialogue||Ah, so you've spent some time with him already? A man that wears a live crab on his head is bound to be a little rough around the edges, I guess.
Dialogue||I was just reading about a farmer, then you walked in.[]Shoot, where's that book about the handsome wizard?
Dialogue||I'd ask what you do for fun, but I'll guess... reading?
Dialogue||Who do you like to hang out with in Sun Haven?
Dialogue||You're so perceptive, it's amazing the way your brain works.[]You're familiar with sarcasm, right? Otherwise, I can direct you to the book that will teach you all about it.
Dialogue||I made friends with Camila shortly after she moved here. You could say we see the world through a similar lens. She has no patience for annoyances, either.
Dialogue||Come on, you don't have any other hobbies?
Dialogue||I shouldn't have asked.
Dialogue||If you must know, I'm learning self-defense from one of the guards at the barracks.[]Have you met Allison? She's a good teacher. And she can throw me clear across a room.
Dialogue||You two sound scary...
Dialogue||It must have been nicer for you after she moved here.
Dialogue||You better stop bugging me then, or else the scary ladies will get you.
Dialogue||Sure, it's nice having a like minded friend in town. You must have made some friends by now, right?[]It's not that hard in this town. Just start talking to people. Everyone's so keen on making friends here.
Dialogue||... Hm? Oh, I must have missed what you said. I was thinking of an interlude in the song I'm writing.
Dialogue||You seem like a lively one. I don't think we'll get along too well.			
Dialogue||We're lucky to have you here, XX.			
Dialogue||I never noticed how defined your features are. I love looking at your face!
Dialogue||I bet I would look better in something made by you.
Dialogue||Every day I see your face is a good day, Lynn.
Dialogue||You mean like armor? I guess I could do that, but you'd have to put in an order with Solon and I would need your measurements.
Dialogue||Come on XX, you know I hate it when you make my face turn red!
Dialogue||You can measure me here and now!
Dialogue||Just kidding, I don't want to add to your workload.
Dialogue||You know, I'm actually really busy with other work, XX. Maybe another time.
Dialogue||Oh, XX you goose! You had me going there.[]Uh oh, am I too gullible?
Dialogue||I'm surprised I still have that effect on you. 
Dialogue||Even if you still get embarrassed, you've really come out of your shell since we met.
Dialogue||Honestly, I don't know if you ever WON'T have that effect on me. Just go easy on me, okay?
Dialogue||Thank you XX. I know I've come a long way, but I think you take a little credit for that, too. 
Dialogue||Keep an eye out for local villains today. I mostly mean Topi and Pod, but you never know.
Dialogue||How have you been enjoying Nel'Vari? Is it everything you thought the home of the Elves would be?																																																																																																																																					
Dialogue||Hi again, XX. Do you want to chat? I've been trying to be more social lately.
Dialogue||If you want to be social, you should try the tavern.
Dialogue||So Lynn... do you have a partner back home?
Dialogue||I do go there, at the end of hard work days when I need to zone out. I like to find a corner of the tavern and listen to the chatter of voices for a while. It's oddly soothing!
Dialogue||As in, a romantic partner? Sorry, that caught me off guard.[]Just pretend like I'm not blushing for a second![]The answer is no. Actually... I've never even been on a date.[]Oh sheesh, why did I tell you that?? Pretend like you don't know that, okay?
Dialogue||I'm surprised you can zone out in the tavern with all that noise.
Dialogue||I'm surprised you don't join in the conversation.
Dialogue||Small talk is difficult for me, but a room full of voices has a good feeling to it. I'll even close my eyes to listen... and then it doesn't feel like I'm alone at my table.
Dialogue||If you lived in the Great City, I bet you'd get lots of dates.
Dialogue||I knew it.
Dialogue||Oh, shush or my face will get all red!!
Dialogue||Oh? Is it that... unsurprising? I guess I shouldn't be surprised, either.
Dialogue||As much as I hope this town gets its revival, I worry about competing stores opening their doors.
Dialogue||What? Are you worried the commoners will see you with me? Hah, let them look!																		 									
Dialogue||Have you been spending more time up at that ridiculous rooftop garden? I'll never understand why!
Dialogue||What's wrong with the rooftop garden?
Dialogue||Doesn't anyone else in the city farm?
Dialogue||Look around you! Withergate has everything it needs. I designed the city, don't you remember?[]I included that rooftop garden as a technicality, in case someone around here ever decided to actually start some farming. I never expected anyont to actually <i>use</i> it!
Dialogue||Not anyone in the city, no. Why would they need to? Withergate has everything anyone could want, ever. I designed it that way.
Dialogue||A bit shortsighted of you.
Dialogue||Lucky you thought to include one, though.
Dialogue||That's real big talk for someone who spends all day digging through dirt on a rooftop! 
Dialogue||Well, of course I thought to include one. It's just like I said, though, I never expected anyone would ever use it. But I guess even I can't always predict my own genius!
Dialogue||It has everything except a real farm.
Dialogue||Fair enough.
Dialogue||Are we going to pretend the rooftop farm isn't a real farm? Just because it takes up an otherwise perfectly good rooftop doesn't make it a fake farm or something!
Dialogue||Right? Thanks for seeing it my way. Now run back to your little rooftop farm, farmer.
Dialogue||You really own your look!																	
Dialogue||Elizabeth made a painting of me the other day. She's so adorable, and Jun loaned her some of his paints! I really need to thank him, but I'm just not sure how...
Dialogue||Why don't you know how to thank Jun?
Dialogue||Elizabeth must really love you to paint a picture of you.
Dialogue||I mean, I'm really grateful he let Elizabeth use his paints. It was very kind of him, but... how do I thank him the right way?[]What if I try to get him a thank you gift and he doesn't like it? Oh, that'd be so awkward!
Dialogue||Shucks! Both my sisters love me! And I love them, too. Still, though, when I saw Elizabeth's little painting of me, I almost cried a little.[]Ah, I can't believe I just told you that!
Dialogue||Just let him know what it means to you, that'd be enough.
Dialogue||If you're that worried, then don't do anything.
Dialogue||You think so, XX? Yeah, I guess you're right. Jun is a really peaceful guy, he wouldn't really be expecting a gift as a thank you. Hm, maybe a fresh batch of rolls though?[]That seems like a fair gift in exchange for paint, I think.
Dialogue||That's even worse! I'm going to worry about this all night, now! All this over a painting, yeesh!
Dialogue||Don't be embarassed, Liam.
Dialogue||Everyone knows you love your sisters, it's no big deal.
Dialogue||Easier said than done! My cheeks aren't red, are they? Now I'm worried about that! And I'm still not sure just how to thank Jun!
Dialogue||I know everyone knows, but it's still a little embarrassing to cry at a painting, isn't it? My cheeks aren't red, are they? Now I'm worried about that! And I'm still not sure just how to thank Jun!
Dialogue||I only take my wedding ring off when I'm working - trust me, it's for the best.														
Dialogue||Hey XX, I got these for you. Think of them as a thank-you for our date.
Dialogue||What should I do with this?
Dialogue||You're giving me greenroot?
Dialogue||Well, some people like to bake it into a dessert - some kind of peach cobbler, I'm unsure - but I prefer to just eat it raw.
Dialogue||That's right, they're my favorite. But what's the point in loving something if I can't share it?
Dialogue||That sounds rough.
Dialogue||That sounds good!
Dialogue||Oh, do you really think so? Most people are repulsed by the taste of raw greenroot. I'm not surprised that you're the same.
Dialogue||Oh, do you really think so? Most people are repulsed by the taste of raw greenroot. I'm surprised that you're the opposite.
Dialogue||It's okay to enjoy things on your own, Vaan.
Dialogue||I'm happy to share the things you love.
Dialogue||I'm well aware, but I want to share with you right now. But I guess I can't make you do anything you don't want to.
Dialogue||Frankly, I'm glad you enjoy raw greenroot. It's definitely not for everybody!
Dialogue||I hope your day finds a good end, XX!
Dialogue||You married an Elf <i>and</i> an enchantress, but I'm the one who feels lucky to have you, XX.																																																																																									
Dialogue||I've been thinking of romance a lot these past days. It's strange to me, how do you think people do it?
Dialogue||What's got you thinking about romance?
Dialogue||Haven't you ever wanted to fall in love?
Dialogue||I dunno. Just strange, I wonder how people seem so easily cut out for it.[]Meeting, getting married, the home life. All that stuff.
Dialogue||I've never pictured myself doing it, at least. There's been times where I thought maybe I was feeling that way, but they never worked out.[]If I think about the future, it's mostly just about my music.
Dialogue||I guess it just comes more naturally to some people.
Dialogue||Lots of people grow up with the expectation of falling in love and getting married.
Dialogue||Yeah. Still so strange, though. I wonder if it'll happen to me, or how I'd even make it happen. It's all so ethereal, I guess.
Dialogue||Suppose that's true. I never thought much about it, even as a kid, so I guess as I grew up it was still never something I thought about.[]Most people seem like it's such a no-brainer to them.
Dialogue||Don't push yourself to conform to any standards that aren't your own.
Dialogue||You probably just never looked hard enough to find love.
Dialogue||Heh, thanks. I told myself something like that a long time ago, but it's good to hear it from someone else. 
Dialogue||Well... you aren't wrong. I probably didn't, but you make it sound like that's inherently wrong, XX. 
Dialogue||How have you been holding on, XX? I've been busier than ever!
Dialogue||What's got you so busy?
Dialogue||If you could take a vacation, where would you go?
Dialogue||Sun Haven has really picked up a lot of steam lately. There's more to take care of as Archmage! I don't mind the extra work, but it's more than I'm accustomed to.
Dialogue||I don't have any time to even think about taking a vacation, but... if I could choose anywhere...[]Well, it's said that there are many ancient ruins in the Northern Region. Those would be pretty interesting to see.[]And I could test my fire power out against the cold harshness of the north!
Dialogue||If anyone can do it, it's you!
Dialogue||You signed up for this when you became Archmage.
Dialogue||Well, that's certainly a good point. It doesn't matter how much I have to do, I'll go above and beyond for everyone in Sun Haven.
Dialogue||I am very aware of that, XX. I'm not sure why you felt a need to remind me.
Dialogue||I didn't expect such an adventurous answer.
Dialogue||That doesn't sound like a very relaxing vacation!
Dialogue||Serving Sun Haven is my life's work, but if I ever have the chance, it would be fun to adventure in a new land and experience new things. Maybe one day.
Dialogue||XX! I'm glad you're here, I could use a friendly face. I've been pretty stressed out...
Dialogue||Maybe a walk on the beach would relax you.
Dialogue||Why don't we meet up together? Sounds like we could both use it.
Dialogue||I've only been down there once. Maybe I should spend more time in nature. What do you think?
Dialogue||Oh! Wow, just... the two of us? That sounds nice! Let's do it.
Dialogue||Nature helps to clear your head, sometimes.
Dialogue||Nature won't help with your stress. Maybe you should talk to Jun.
Dialogue||Well, it's certainly a better solution than no solution at all. Thanks XX, I'll give it a shot.
Dialogue||Oh yeah, he's the counselor right? I don't know if I could do that, though. Just open up to a complete stranger... but maybe it wouldn't be so bad.
Dialogue||Tomorrow, then?
Dialogue||On second thought, we better not.
Dialogue||Yeah! I think I already know where we should go. Just meet me in front of my house tomorrow at 10:00 am!
Dialogue||Now that you mention it, I suppose you're right.
Dialogue||Nathaniel has lots of charisma but he's not very organized.																																																			
Dialogue||I'm only a visitor here.										
Dialogue||If it were up to me, Sun Haven would have big walls all around it.														
Dialogue||Ever since this Withergate thing cropped up, I've had eyes on the back of my head.[]Er, but that's just a saying. I only have the two eyes up front, obviously.
Dialogue||What do you think of the Withergate rumors?
Dialogue||So what made you become a hunter?
Dialogue||They're not just rumors, I've seen the monster city myself. Yeah, huge fiery towers and flying monsters everywhere. We need to be prepared, because a fight is coming.
Dialogue||I guess I started as a teenager. Both my folks had bad joints from working the mines their whole lives, so they couldn't spend long days walking in the forest.[]It was up to me to provide when money was tight, so I taught myself how to track and hunt. I got so good at it, I started teaching lessons to bring in some money on the side.
Dialogue||Has anyone else seen it?
Dialogue||Where did you see it?
Dialogue||No, I was alone. Well, I had my friend with me but he was knocked unconscious by a golem. I barely got us out of there alive!
Dialogue||I can't be sure because it was so dark. I wandered alone for two days before I found the road back to Sun Haven.
Dialogue||Your parents were lucky to have you.
Dialogue||You've never had any professional lessons?
Dialogue||Thanks farmer. Not to get a big head about it, but I'm real proud of being a provider! It feels good to give back.
Dialogue||You're not hearing me, farmer - I <i>am</i> the professional in this situation.
Dialogue||Hey XX! You're looking real good today - don't change!																																																														
Dialogue||How long have we been together now? I'm already forgetting what it was like being without you!
Dialogue||We've both changed a lot. Just wait until I get you eating healthy.
Dialogue||Do you miss running around without any attachments?
Dialogue||I don't really know what eating "healthy" means, but I always feel good after eating a lot of meat. I especially love a big steak.[]If it makes me feel good, that's got to mean it's healthy. Right?
Dialogue||If you're asking whether or not I miss being single - without you - then it's a big fat NO. Sometimes I think about running off somewhere, but that's just animal instinct.[]When it comes down to it, I really love being with you, XX.
Dialogue||You know you need vegetables too, right?
Dialogue||That's... not right. But I can help you with your diet!
Dialogue||... Why would you say something like that? Don't even joke, XX.
Dialogue||Hm... All right, I trust you. But I won't stop eating meat! I need it. For my soul, which is in my stomach.
Dialogue||Good, because I don't like the idea of you running around who-knows-where.
Dialogue||If you ever feel the need to run off somewhere, don't stop on my account.
Dialogue||Whoa, slow down XX. I'm not going to stop my outings just because we're together. That would change who I am entirely, which is just not going to happen.
Dialogue||And that's why you're the only one for me, XX. You let me be myself. But part of being a wolf is having a pack, and it feels really good to have one now.
Dialogue||Feel free to sleep in my house whenever you want, XX!																	
Dialogue||One time I found a gold coin at the beach!						
Dialogue||When Solon works hard, he works <i>really</i> hard! He was smacking a breastplate with such force the other day that he cracked the anvil nearly in half!
Dialogue||Your ears must be ringing at the end of the day.
Dialogue||Does it ever make you want to find a new place to work?
Dialogue||It's true! No one seems to think how loud working in a smithery must be! Thankfully Solon normally has enough wares that he only worries about selling the stock.[]But whenever he gets on an anvil... my head rings for days!
Dialogue||Of course not! I find Solon incredibly inspiring, actually. To strike metal so hard you break your anvil! It's not just his raw strength that does that, you know.[]Solon is working, all day every day, honing his mastery. If I could even be a tenth the blacksmith Solon is, I'd be so proud of myself.
Dialogue||You should try some kind of ear plugs.
Dialogue||My head hurts just thinking about it.
Dialogue||Hmm. To plug up my ears? That's maybe not a bad idea, XX. I'll have to look into that sometime!
Dialogue||Well, I hope next time you're exhausted after a hard day work that you count your lucky stars that you don't have to put up with Solon's hammering!
Dialogue||You're going to surpass Solon in no time!
Dialogue||A student could never surpass a master.
Dialogue||No matter what, it's what I want to do! I don't care how many hammer smacks I have to listen to!
Dialogue||Sorry XX, but I've never heard anything so ridiculous.
Dialogue||When I shut my eyes, you're the first thing I see. Do you see me too?																		
Dialogue||Stay sharp, neighbor.						
Dialogue||Hello there, you're the new neighbor? I'm happy to make your acquaintance. I'm Pod's mother, Kara. 
Dialogue||Hi Kara, my name is XX.
Dialogue||XX, now that's a nice name. I'm glad that old farm has someone to care for it now. It used to be so beautiful.
Dialogue||Mama lies down a lot, but she always plays games with me!						
Dialogue||This work isn't glamorous, but it sure is fun.														
Dialogue||Do you have a question about my work?													
Dialogue||The farmer and the soldier... it almost sounds like the start to a fairytale.																								
Dialogue||"Married" is such an adult word. It's weird to think that it applies to me... I barely feel like an adult!																																																																				
Dialogue||Back in my prime I could have solved this “monster town” problem overnight!									
Dialogue||I was hoping my kid would look like me, but Topi inherited his father's hair...																																																																																																																																																																													
Dialogue||Your magic seems a lot stronger now, XX. I'm really glad Elios gave you his blessing.
Dialogue||Have you ever visited Elios on Dragon's Meet?
Dialogue||You never got his blessing?
Dialogue||Yes, I visited Elios. It was a true honor being in the presence of such strong magic... though I didn't much like the hike up the mountain.[]I'm glad I did it, but I'm also glad that I don't have to do it again!
Dialogue||No, I'm afraid not. Otherwise, I would be able to channel magic through my body like you and Lucia. But I think I get by just fine with my witchcraft.
Dialogue||I'm surprised that hiking is a challenge for someone like you.
Dialogue||The journey to Dragon's Meet is tough. I guess that means you're tougher!
Dialogue||Hiking is no problem, but being escorted through monsters and blazing heat is entirely different. Give me some credit, XX!
Dialogue||Aw, thanks! I had blisters on my heels for a week, haha.[]Hard as it was, it was well worth getting a blessing from the Sun Dragon. Honestly, I don't think I've felt that good before or since.
Dialogue||It's amazing that you have such a deep connection with magic, then.
Dialogue||You have a truly unique relationship with magic.
Dialogue||Magic is everywhere, XX. Everyone has a connection to it, but some people don't pay attention. I just pay attention, that's all.
Dialogue||XX, good to see you! Do you need any help managing your finances? I have some great tips!
Dialogue||Since you know so much, why not just buy a shop in town?
Dialogue||I know you've traveled a lot for work. How many cities have you lived in?
Dialogue||My mobility is a key part of my success. To put it simply, I find my way out when the gold stops coming in. That's how I've survived this long.[]It's a lot harder to leave if my shop isn't on wheels!
Dialogue||Oh jeez... I've visited too many to count but I only actually lived in about ten of them. A couple here in the Western Region, five in the Eastern Region, and three in the north.
Dialogue||Maybe if you put your effort into a store, customers would travel to you.
Dialogue||You've got some good survival instincts! 
Dialogue||I put plenty of effort into my shop already, XX. Besides, a farmer is the last person I would take business advice from.
Dialogue||Of course I do! Whoops, I mean... thanks! Survival was the first thing I learned. The second was business.
Dialogue||You've never lived in the south?
Dialogue||You spent a lot of time in the east, huh?
Dialogue||One day I will, but only after I'm done with my merchant cart. Getting it to the islands in the south is a real pain - it doesn't float and transportation costs more than it's worth.
Dialogue||Easterners treated me very kindly. Plus, they have very loose pockets, if you know what I mean! They can be a little traditional for my taste, but everyone is welcoming no matter where you go.[]Not to mention the food. The servings they give are huge!
Dialogue||From outsider to one of Withergate's top personalities. Well done, XX.																																																																																									 									
Dialogue||There's my farmer!
Dialogue||Do you think I'm "yours?"
Dialogue||So what are the rules for dating civilians, anyway?
Dialogue||Oh, of course not! I wouldn't think that. I just meant - well, I'm always happy when I can see you.
Dialogue||Well, the rules of decorum don't explicitly say anything against it... I don't think we have anything to worry about, XX.
Dialogue||Don't worry, Nathaniel - I'm kidding!
Dialogue||It's okay Nathaniel, I can be yours.
Dialogue||Oh man, you had me going there. The last thing I want to do is make you upset.
Dialogue||That's too bad - I kind of like breaking the rules.
Dialogue||That's good, I don't want to get you in any trouble.
Dialogue||Maybe you do, but I still have a career to protect.
Dialogue||Any trouble that comes my way is only on me, XX. Don't worry. Everything will work out just fine, I know it!
Dialogue||Good day, citizen! Heh, don't worry XX, I haven't forgotten your name.[]I've been here long enough to know everyone's name by heart.
Dialogue||You're in a good mood.
Dialogue||How long have you been here, anyway?
Dialogue||I try to keep spirits up when I'm on duty. I find it calms the civilians. Besides, it's refreshing to wear a smile sometimes instead of my army face.
Dialogue||I shipped here about... five years ago now?[]Wow, I never counted the years before. Time really flies by. But I guess that's part of what it means to dedicate your service to a cause.
Dialogue||Don't you worry that people won't take you seriously?
Dialogue||Keeping people calm in tense times is very thoughtful.
Dialogue||Not at all. At least, I didn't before you said that...
Dialogue||Why thank you, XX! The soldier's motto is "Duty through service," but that doesn't always have to mean combat.
Dialogue||That's a long time.
Dialogue||I'm surprised you can stay positive after all that time.
Dialogue||Duty through service, right? Luckily, Sun Haven is a great city. Even if I have to give five more years, I'm glad it's here.
Dialogue||Hi neighbor. Got something on your mind?
Dialogue||Would you say Sun Haven is a good place to raise a family?
Dialogue||So you're an artist?
Dialogue||Tonya and I have lived here our whole lives. Plus, we had Topi here. That's three generations of families, and we're all happy as clams!
Dialogue||Oh sure, I've been an artist since I was, well, close to your age. I only started sculpting about a year ago, so I'm still perfecting my craft.
Dialogue||You don't have any complaints about this town?
Dialogue||I guess we could use an art supplies store. I have to forage berries to make my own paint. It gets real messy...
Dialogue||A year isn't enough time?
Dialogue||No matter how long it takes, progress is progress.
Dialogue||I didn't realize I was speaking with such a critic. Artistic expression has no timeline.
Dialogue||That's what I say! Well, not exactly in those words. Actually, what I say is quite different. But I like what you said, too!
Dialogue||Truth be told, this armor is a little big on me.						 					
Dialogue||You know, we should work together. With your fresh ingredients, I could make some delicious treats!
Dialogue||Don't they say not to mix business with your personal life?
Dialogue||But your food is already so fresh!
Dialogue||Who says that? Is that a real thing? I haven't heard it before, but I'm often oblivious to these things.
Dialogue||Well yeah, but not as fresh as your crops! I'm really curious to know if there's a difference in the taste.
Dialogue||It's just a saying.
Dialogue||It's true, you know.
Dialogue||If I'm not supposed to mix business with my personal life, then I was doomed from the start. How caould anyone have a family business like that?
Dialogue||Okay, it sounds fun!
Dialogue||I don't think it's a good idea for us to work together.
Dialogue||Yeah? Great! I can't wait to see what we make together, XX!
Dialogue||Oh... Okay then, I understand. Forget I mentioned it.
Dialogue||Fine art is a satisfying form of expression, but farming seems pretty creative too.
Dialogue||How is farming creative?
Dialogue||What other kinds of art do you do?
Dialogue||You're over there growing living things all day. If you ask me, making a living thing is as creative as it gets!
Dialogue||I've dabbled here and there over the years. I've done my share of painting, and still do. I also used to whittle, but I stopped because I kept cutting my fingers.
Dialogue||That's true, it's very rewarding.
Dialogue||I don't think of it like that.
Dialogue||I know how you feel. My art is fulfilling too, but it's nothing compared to having Topi. He's my best work yet!
Dialogue||Ah, maybe you're not much of an artist then.
Dialogue||What's your favorite art form?
Dialogue||How do you choose which art form to practice?
Dialogue||I haven't been sculpting that long, but I'm completely obsessed with it. I'm probably just in the honeymoon phase, though. I'm sure I'll discover something new in a couple months.
Dialogue||When something new finds me, it I become completely obsessed with it. I know I'm just in the honeymoon phase with sculpting right now.  I'll probably discover something new in a couple months.
Dialogue||XX... You're staring at my dog parts. I don't really care, but if you have a question then just ask. No need to be all... starey.
Dialogue||Sorry... Is it hard to wear hats with those wolf ears?
Dialogue||I've been holding onto this for a long time - you have a really great tail.
Dialogue||Ha ha, you're a real clown, XX. I can wear hats just fine... probably. Come to think of it, I've never actually tried before. Are my ears that big?
Dialogue||Hey, thanks! I try to keep it clean. I'm pretty proud of it. But sometimes it causes more trouble than it's worth.
Dialogue||They really are.
Dialogue||I think it's cute!
Dialogue||Whatever, I can hear a pin drop on the other side of a crowded room. Who cares if I can't wear dumb hats?
Dialogue||Whatever, I can hear a pin drop on the other side of a crowded room. But, I guess looking cute can be useful too!
Dialogue||What kind of trouble?
Dialogue||I can't tell if you like it or not.
Dialogue||I'm always knocking things over with it or hitting strangers. You'd think I'd get used to it, but sometimes it's like it has a mind of its own...
Dialogue||My life would be easier without it, but I can't deny that it completes my look. Yeah, it's a complicated relationship.[]Well, what do you think? Best tail in Withergate? ... Of course the answer is yes!
Dialogue||Lucia is both direct and kind. She's truly a born leader.																																																																			
Dialogue||Sometimes it's nice to take things slow. Even Sun Haven has slowed down these days.			 					
Dialogue||This talk about Withergate has me on edge. Am I the only one?																									
Dialogue||Look around you. Everything the darkness touches will be mine someday.																																																																																																																			 									
Dialogue||It's surprising there aren't more married couples in Sun Haven. Hey, maybe we'll start a trend?																																																																												
Dialogue||I'm something of a queen among my fellow merchants, you know. Yep, you're dating royalty!																
Dialogue||You smell wonderful today, XX. Oh - you're not wearing any perfume?
Dialogue||Hey XX, having fun yet? There's always something to do here![]I spend a lot of time just exploring the town. When I'm not working, of course.
Dialogue||Do you have any hobbies just for fun?
Dialogue||Do you have a favorite spot around town?
Dialogue||I like cooking big meals for myself, if you count that. I usually make too much, though. Say, I should give you some leftovers the next time I cook.
Dialogue||I just love the windmills on the way to the beach. You've seen them by now, right?[]Try this, lie in the grass and watch the windmills spin against the sky. Without fail, it always takes my mind away. The way they spin in unison is mesmerizing. I wonder, how do they do that?
Dialogue||You shouldn't waste food like that.
Dialogue||That sounds great! I bet you're a fantastic cook.
Dialogue||Relax XX, I don't waste food. I share with my pet mouse, Charlie. Let's not make assumptions about each other, okay?
Dialogue||Hey, don't take my word for it. Bring me some potatoes and I'll make you a great egg hash!
Dialogue||I'll have to try it!
Dialogue||Spinning things make me dizzy...
Dialogue||Just be careful not to get sunburned. I fell asleep out there once and came back looking like Peter's pet crab.
Dialogue||In that case, there's always the beach - plenty of natural beauty there, too. That's the thing about Sun Haven, you find beauty no matter where you look.
Dialogue||The music has been great lately. Come get on the dance floor sometime!											
Dialogue||I'm just trying to make the best life for myself here, same as anyone.																				
Dialogue||You're really starting to like Withergate, huh XX? I can see it on your face!
Dialogue||You know, Withergate is actually a nice community.
Dialogue||I wonder what it's like to live in the castle...
Dialogue||I can see that. But I try not to get too involved with community wherever I am. Who knows when I'll need to split, right?
Dialogue||Castle, shmastle. Nobody needs all that space. I get that they're royalty, but... I mean, who cares! Give me a leafy tree to sleep under and I'm happy.
Dialogue||Would you really leave Withergate?
Dialogue||It's good to keep your options open.
Dialogue||Sure, if I had to. But hey, it's not like I'm planning on it or anything. This city has been the best home I've had, maybe ever!
Dialogue||No way - I just said the exact same thing last night! Man XX, you and I really seem to be on the same page these days.
Dialogue||Kings should live in regular houses, like the rest of us.
Dialogue||You wouldn't say that if the prince were here right now.
Dialogue||Oh, that's a great idea. Then we could make the castle into a huge carnival ride. I bet it already looks like a carnival on the inside, too.
Dialogue||Oh man, don't get me started on the prince. That guy really needs to relax!
Dialogue||XX, my muse, my love. My future. Am I the only one having trouble believing that this is reality? 
Dialogue||What makes our marriage so unbelievable?
Dialogue||I look forward to the songs you'll compose throughout our lives together.
Dialogue||It's impossible for me to imagine perfection. If I do something, then inherently it will have flaws. That's just how I've always been, and how I've done my music.[]But... I can't seem to find anything imperfect about us. It's new to me, but I think I can adjust.
Dialogue||In the past, something like that might have made me feel as if I were put under pressure. But now, I feel excited. Inspired. This is the best I've ever felt in my life, maybe.[]I look forward to the songs I will compose during our marriage, too. 
Dialogue||Well believe it or not, we're perfect together!
Dialogue||I thought you'd feel better about our marriage.
Dialogue||I think so too, XX. I've committed my everything to you, and I know I won't ever regret it. 
Dialogue||I didn't mean it like that, XX. I'm sorry if I upset you. 
Dialogue||It's nice to finally see you feeling so inspired.
Dialogue||It's about time you got your inspiration back so strong.
Dialogue||Heh, is that why you married me? To see me inspired? I'm joking, of course. 
Dialogue||Hello! Looking for a pick-me-up?
Dialogue||Where do you get your food?
Dialogue||So is coffee your passion?
Dialogue||I actually managed to set up a daily order with the baker, Liam. He's a really talented artisan. And so close! It's quite convenient. 
Dialogue||I don't know if my passion is coffee, exactly... But! I do enjoy being hospitable and helping people start their days.[]It helps to start your day with a smiling face. I'm more than happy to provide the smile!
Dialogue||I'm glad Liam is getting more business.
Dialogue||You chose a good place to open shop!
Dialogue||He should have plenty of business now that I'm here. I saw he has two little girls with him, too.[]Not that I was spying or anything! I'm not <i>that</i> nosy, heh. I just like to know where my money is going.
Dialogue||The opportunity sort of fell into my lap, actually. I was just passing through on my way to the bigger cities farther west, but then I saw the café was available.[]And it was so cute! I just had to buy it up. I only hope my investment has a nice return... I hope you drink a lot of coffee! 
Dialogue||It's important to start the day on a positive note.
Dialogue||You really think you're making that much of a difference?
Dialogue||That's exactly what keeps me in hospitality work. Interacting with people and helping them in small ways is gratifying work. 
Dialogue||As a matter of fact, I do. Anyone who thinks differently can politely hush up!
Dialogue||We could spend more time together if we weren't both so busy. Maybe I'll take some time off... maybe.																
Dialogue||There's nothing more exciting than a fresh start.				 					
Dialogue||Another quiet day.																	
Dialogue||Supposedly there are a lot of monsters traveling the roads lately. They're all headed to a city called Withergate. Supposedly. 									
Dialogue||Do I smell funny? A potion blew up on me this morning. Witchcraft can be a messy business...
Dialogue||So what got you into witchcraft, anyway?
Dialogue||Is there anything you hope to accomplish as a witch?
Dialogue||This might sound bad, but I started looking at spells when I was a kid so I could play tricks on my littermates. I managed to keep it secret for months!
Dialogue||All I want from my craft is to make life comfortable for myself and my loved ones. Witchcraft makes that a whole lot easier. 
Dialogue||You figured out witchcraft as a child?
Dialogue||You were so mischievous!
Dialogue||Yep, I got a bit of a head start. It was definitely more power than a kid should have, that's for sure.[]It's certainly paid off now - my whole living is based off my magic!
Dialogue||I was! Thankfully I grew out of misusing my magic.[]To be honest, I started a lot of fights. It's a good thing my mother caught on.
Dialogue||Why practice magic if you don't have any big goals?
Dialogue||All that matters is that you're happy doing it.
Dialogue||You should keep in mind that I've been practicing since I was just a kid. I know what I'm doing, and I really don't need any criticism from you, XX.
Dialogue||I think so, too. Sometimes just keeping yourself happy is enough.[]Hey, maybe I could show you some spellcraft sometime!
Dialogue||Making coffee is almost like a ceremony in the East.								
Dialogue||Using a rolling pin all day is a surprisingly tough exercise. I'm still waiting for the muscles to come in...						
Dialogue||I decided a long time ago to give my life in service to Sun Haven.
Dialogue||You're just like one of your crops - started as a seed but grown strong and elegant.
Dialogue||You see me like a plant?
Dialogue||You're unlike anyone I've ever met, Vaan.
Dialogue||Yes! You know, you're really precious when you're watered.
Dialogue||Of course I am, and so are you. I think that's a big reason why we fell for each other, XX. Nobody else fits us.
Dialogue||You're messing with me.
Dialogue||Watered??
Dialogue||That's right, my precious sunflower - haha!
Dialogue||Yes, my precious sunflower.[]Haha, I just like pushing your buttons.
Dialogue||Even I don't understand you sometimes.
Dialogue||We're two of a kind.
Dialogue||Is that how you've felt this whole time? Maybe there really isn't a perfect match for me after all.
Dialogue||As long as I have you in my life, XX, I'll feel complete. I would fly anywhere with you.
Dialogue||Ever since we got together, I've been gaining weight. It's good - I was a little skinny before.
Dialogue||I thought you looked a little healthier.
Dialogue||Since we're together, do I get free medical care?
Dialogue||Oh yeah? Well feel free to mention it next time! I'm not opposed to flattery, you know. Who doesn't enjoy a nice compliment?
Dialogue||I still have to make a living, you know. Unless you want to take over paying my bills?
Dialogue||All right then - nobody wears a white cloak like you do!
Dialogue||I don't want your head getting too big.
Dialogue||Despite the fact that nobody in Sun Haven wears a white cloak other than me, I'll take the compliment. Haha, thank you XX!
Dialogue||Is this a legitimate concern of yours? I'm a grown man, XX. I know how to handle my own ego.
Dialogue||You're on your own there, Wornhardt.
Dialogue||I'll always support you, even paying your bills if I have to.
Dialogue||Haha, I think I'll manage! A doctor's paycheck is pretty good, you know.
Dialogue||Thank goodness it won't come to that. A doctor's paycheck is pretty good, you know.
Dialogue||My mother warned me not to marry someone based on looks.											
Dialogue||Science is like a kind of magic, too. At least, it looks like magic to anyone who doesn't understand it.																											
Dialogue||I wish I could stay to chat with you, really. Unfortunately, I must be going.
Dialogue||Ah, my little ray of darkness. It's good to see you.																																																															 									
Dialogue||Hello again. XX, isn't it?
Dialogue||You mentioned your work before. What kind of work do you do?
Dialogue||I'm a composer, so I make music. Making music is all I've ever done, and all I really care to do.
Dialogue||I'm hardly ever not working. But when I do take a break, I'll stop in the tavern to have a meal or go for a walk. That's maybe once a day.
Dialogue||I'd love to hear your music, sometime.
Dialogue||Is that how you got so rich?
Dialogue||... Really? Funny, people don't usually show interest in my work.
Dialogue||Typical - all anyone ever cares about is my money.
Dialogue||You only get out once a day?
Dialogue||What do you like to eat?
Dialogue||We can't all be farmers, XX.
Dialogue||I prefer a good soup. I try to get meat and vegetables in one sitting in case I forget to eat again that day.
Dialogue||My name's Allison, but my friends call me Allie. What's yours?
Dialogue||I'm XX. Nice meeting you!
Dialogue||Very glad to meet you, XX! It's nice to see fresh faces in this town.
Dialogue||How are you, XX? You're looking really good!
Dialogue||You seem to be doing well these days, too.
Dialogue||You've gained some muscle yourself.
Dialogue||You know, maybe it does feel like the days are getting easier. I don't even know what changed, to be honest.
Dialogue||Really? I don't know why that would be... I guess I've been lifting more bags of flour now that business is starting to pick up a bit.
Dialogue||I know what changed - you!
Dialogue||It must be because of Jun's work.
Dialogue||I guess so, huh? Or, you know, it could even be because of a new relationship... Can you tell I'm talking about you? Because I am!
Dialogue||I get what you mean, but I'd like a little credit too.
Dialogue||I'll add bags of flour to my exercise routine.
Dialogue||I'm glad to hear business is good!
Dialogue||Yeah right, like you need any help! Between the farming and adventuring, I'd say your routine works just fine already.
Dialogue||Oh right, I never mentioned - I had my best week yet! Peter asked for thirty loaves of bread. I didn't want to ask why and jinx it, but... I mean, why??
Dialogue||Sun Haven's really starting to feel like home to me now.																																																													
Dialogue||Hi again. Sorry, it's XX, right? It's been a while since somebody new moved in.
Dialogue||No offense Liam, but you look like you need a nap.
Dialogue||What do you do for a living, Liam?
Dialogue||That's only because I do... Sorry, I don't mean to complain. I'm just burning the candle at both ends these days.
Dialogue||I run the bakery. I mean, I'm a baker. I also take care of my sisters. Usually, I'm doing both at the same time.
Dialogue||You should take better care of yourself.
Dialogue||If it makes you feel better, you smell fantastic.
Dialogue||I'm aware, thanks.
Dialogue||Oh? Must be the gingerbread. Hey, that's an upside to baking that I never thought about. Thanks!
Dialogue||Do your sisters help in the bakery?
Dialogue||How old are your sisters?
Dialogue||Emma and Elizabeth, they're just kids. They tried helping me bake once and it went... not too good.[]Calvin returned a cake with glitter in it. I couldn't stop giggling because he had sparkles in his teeth. He was pretty mad...
Dialogue||How is everything with your work, my love?									 																																																										
Dialogue||Fashion helped me find myself as a teenager, so now I share that feeling with the world.							
Dialogue||Good to see ya again, XX. What brings ya in today? 
Dialogue||What are the people like at the inn?
Dialogue||Your tavern is very cozy. There's an inn upstairs too?
Dialogue||These visitors, I tell ya. Baker's dozen, you know? For every twelve good donuts, you get that one weird donut. I keep 'em in line though.
Dialogue||Yup, travelers need a place to refuel and rest their sore behinds.
Dialogue||I'm sure it helps that Ronald is here, too.
Dialogue||You show 'em who's boss, Mari.
Dialogue||Like I said, I got 'em under control.
Dialogue||Thanks doll, I can tell you'll be on my good side. Come by anytime, I'll be sure to take care of ya!
Dialogue||Sore behinds?
Dialogue||Do you get any travelers that have seen Withergate? Or is it just a rumor?
Dialogue||What do ya think they're sitting on for those long hours on horseback?
Dialogue||In this business, you never know what's true and what's not. Could be real stories, could just be a loon looking for some attention.[]Truth be told, I hope they're just rumors...
Dialogue||Hi, farmer! Remember me? I'm Elizabeth!
Dialogue||You remember me?
Dialogue||Are you Liam's new best friend now?
Dialogue||Funny, funny, like how Liam does sock puppets!
Dialogue||That's right, and he's told me a lot about you.
Dialogue||We're not best friends yet.
Dialogue||Liam talked to you about me?? Hehehe!
Dialogue||Oh. Hm... you should be best friends, instead.
Dialogue||Is he good at making sock puppets?
Dialogue||Does he do funny voices too?
Dialogue||The puppets are funny. They bonk each other on the head - bonk!
Dialogue||Yeah, funny voices too! I laugh a lot when he does it, hehe.
Dialogue||Nya nya nyaaaa...
Dialogue||I've been making strides in my work with Nivara lately. You should spend some time with the World Dragon if you're ever feeling lost, spiritually.
Dialogue||I thought you already mastered your magic?
Dialogue||Are you very spiritual, Vaan?
Dialogue||Sure I have, but Nivara still has plenty to teach. Her wisdom spans farther than just magic, anyway.[]I'm talking about spirituality, XX! You must be slightly familiar with the concept.
Dialogue||Heh, you still have a thing or two to learn about Elven society, XX.[]Spirituality is part of every Elf's life on some level. It's important for my magic, so I focus on it quite a bit.
Dialogue||Sure I am! 
Dialogue||I am not, actually.
Dialogue||Oh yeah? That's great! I've wondered if the Sun Dragon taught similar lessons. It's good knowing that Nivara isn't the only source of wisdom in the world.
Dialogue||Oh, no? I've wondered if the Sun Dragon taught you that kind of stuff along with the usual blessing. I guess not all dragons can dispense wisdom like Nivara.
Dialogue||Spirituality doesn't help me with my magic, though.
Dialogue||That explains why your magic is so strong.
Dialogue||XX, your ignorance is showing. Your spirit comes into play with every use of magic, no matter if you realize it or not.
Dialogue||It's certainly part of the reason, yes. You could probably have a similar experience if you focused more on your own spirituality!
Dialogue||Where are you going, nya? Can I come too? Oh wait, I forgot I'm so so busy!				
Dialogue||The Elven Elder told me they approved of our union. You may not quite grasp the significance of that, but it's really amazing!
Dialogue||What's the significance of the approval?
Dialogue||Haven't you met anyone outside of Nel'Vari before?
Dialogue||It means you're fully recognized as part of Nel'Vari. I didn't need the approval of the Elder to marry you, but it does mean you're an honorary member of Nel'Vari.[]Isn't that wonderful?
Dialogue||Only a few people, travelers in the forest. Nobody that caught my eye.[]I guess I could get myself out more. Outside of Nel'Vari, I mean.
Dialogue||I'm glad to be accepted as part of Nel'Vari.
Dialogue||I don't need an Elven Elder to tell me what I am.
Dialogue||Aw, I knew it would happen eventually. You've spent so much time there, and of course marrying me. There was no way you wouldn't be recognized by the Elder. 
Dialogue||Calm down, XX. It's just an old traditional thing. No one is trying to control you.
Dialogue||I'll show you Sun Haven one day!
Dialogue||It's not worth it. The forests are too dangerous.
Dialogue||Really? The Human town, huh? I could learn a lot by walking around your town!
Dialogue||I can very well handle myself, XX. I could even teach you a thing or two.
Dialogue||To think that the first day we met was the start of a journey that ended with marriage. I'm glad that's how it turned out, XX.																																																																																																		
Dialogue||It's about time someone took on that old farm. I look forward to having fresh crops in town again.														
Dialogue||I never saw myself as a farmer's wife... It's not so bad!							
Dialogue||Catherine is a great neighbor, and it's really nice living so close to where I work. You're all the way out there on your farm, don't you ever get lonely?
Dialogue||I tend to keep pretty busy.
Dialogue||It's hard to get lonely with such good friends, though.
Dialogue||That is very true. You're always coming and going, it seems. I don't know where you find the energy!
Dialogue||That's a very sweet thing of you to say. You must have met most of the people around town by now. I'm still a little shy, even after all this time.
Dialogue||I see you working hard all the time, too.
Dialogue||Hey, I'm Blessed and you're not.
Dialogue||Do you really notice? Solon is always telling me to slow down, but my mother was a real whip cracker! I don't know how to slow down, sometimes!
Dialogue||Maybe I'm not Blessed like you, but you seem like you're being a little bit rude about it...
Dialogue||You're doing fine, Lynn. Everyone is glad to have you.
Dialogue||Come out of your shell a bit sometime. 
Dialogue||You're right, XX. I should come out of my shell a little more often and get around town! Thanks for giving me a confidence booster.
Dialogue||Yeah, I should try getting out and seeing more things Sun Haven has to offer. Kitty keeps asking me to visit her pet shop!
Dialogue||There are times when I look over Sun Haven and remember that I'm in charge. As a young girl, I never would have imagined it.
Dialogue||So you were born in Sun Haven?
Dialogue||What do you think you would be doing if you weren't Sun Haven's Archmage? 
Dialogue||Yes, I'm proudly native to Sun Haven! I was raised here by my grandparents.[]I would not have gained control over my magic as a child without Grandfather. Now I think about him whenever I cast a spell. In that way, I keep his memory alive.
Dialogue||Hm... I imagine I would go into teaching, like Jun. I could teach kids how to control magic like my grandfather did for me.[]Oh, then my pupils would call me master! Little firebugs, how adorable!
Dialogue||Your grandfather left a good legacy behind.
Dialogue||Do you ever think that you're holding onto the past too much?
Dialogue||That's sweet, XX. Thank you for listening. It may be childish, but I like to remember him out loud in stories.
Dialogue||Either you're completely out of touch with your emotions or you've never lost anyone important. For your sake, I hope it's the latter.
Dialogue||You'd be an excellent teacher. 
Dialogue||Maybe you can do that when you're finished as Archmage.
Dialogue||Thank you XX, I think so too. Oh, and then I could leave stamps on students' homework! Stamps with sayings such as, "YOU'RE ON FIRE!" and "HOT STUFF!"[]All right then, it's settled. I would be a teacher - if only for the fun stamps.
Dialogue||In truth, I've no idea when that will be.[]I'm quite protective over this town, so I intend to retain my position until I find a replacement about whom I'm absolutely certain.
Dialogue||I guess this means I shouldn't play on the farm anymore.																																																																																																																																																																																
Dialogue||Oh, the farmer. It's so good having you in town. 
Dialogue||Have you been in Sun Haven a long time?
Dialogue||Do you have a favorite memory from your life here?
Dialogue||What, why do you ask?[]Oh don't worry, I'm only poking fun at you. I know I'm no youngster![]It's been more than thirty years that I've lived here. Most of that time has been with my husband, Albert.
Dialogue||Oh yes, I'm glad you asked! I was a young girl when I first saw Elios. It wasn't on Dragon's Meet, but in the skies above Sun Haven.[]A colony of ghasts came out of nowhere, threatening to attack the town. But Elios wouldn't have it! No, he swooped down from his mountaintop and spouted fire until the ghasts fled back north.
Dialogue||It seems like a waste to spend all that time in one place.
Dialogue||A life like that sounds perfectly peaceful.
Dialogue||You have a lot to learn, kiddo. Maybe one day you'll see what it means to make a life for yourself.
Dialogue||It hasn't been perfect, but it has certainly been nice.
Dialogue||Did anyone panic?
Dialogue||Were you scared? 
Dialogue||It should have been scary, but I didn't panic one bit. In fact, nobody did. Elios took action, so I felt safe. I would even say that I felt strong knowing he was on my side.[]After seeing his power that day, I knew that Sun Haven was one of the safest places in the world. I still believe that to be true.
Dialogue||Withergate must be unlike anything you've ever seen. Yes, I can see it on your face.																																																																					
Dialogue||Withergate is dazzling... but I'm not sure how I got here.											
Dialogue||When's the last time you climbed a nice, tall tree, XX? We should go climbing together sometime, nya!
Dialogue||I don't really climb any trees.
Dialogue||Where do you usually climb trees?
Dialogue||Nya?! Well you should start! It's a great pastime!  
Dialogue||Any tree is a good tree to climb, nya. Out in the forest there's always big, soft, lazy Snaccoons sleeping under the trees![]They're just sooo big and cute, I wish I could keep one as a pet, like my kitties!
Dialogue||What if I fall? 
Dialogue||You're probably a lot better at it than me. 
Dialogue||You just land on your feet, silly! Wait, you're good at that, right? Kitty is! I've never landed anywhere else, nya!
Dialogue||Heheh, I bet you aren't wrong! I've climbed trees my whole life, and I'm very good at it, nya!
Dialogue||A Snaccoon would be a cute pet, but hard to feed!
Dialogue||Don't be crazy, you couldn't keep a Snaccoon as a pet!
Dialogue||That's truuueee, XX! But they sleep a lot, so it gives Kitty plenty of time to find them some food!
Dialogue||You think too small, XX! You gotta dream like Kitty: big!
Dialogue||Hello XX, you've got a funny funny look on your face. Did you sleep okay?
Dialogue||I had a lot of fun on our first date...
Dialogue||Kitty, what do you like most about your work?
Dialogue||Me too, XX! And I can't wait for the next one!
Dialogue||Oh, sooo many things. The pet store looks so cute on the outside. But even most of all is the adorable animals! I always get along with animals so it's easy and fun for me, nya.
Dialogue||Would you like to go out again tomorrow? 
Dialogue||I think we should just be friends, Kitty.
Dialogue||AH! Yes, I'd love to! Oh so fun, nya. You should come to my house tomorrow at 5:00 pm!
Dialogue||Oh, really? I thought different, but okay... I'd rather be friends than nothing, nyaa.
Dialogue||Of course you get along with animals.
Dialogue||You're lucky to have a job you love.
Dialogue||What do you mean, nyan?? That's very very rude, XX! You need to treat Kitty nicer.
Dialogue||I agree, teehee! It's much more fun. Sometimes I see Emmett in the store and he doesn't look so happy... but I can tell you like your farm, nya!
Dialogue||You're looking nice, XX. I like keeping company with orderly people.
Dialogue||I feel like we're getting to be pretty good friends.
Dialogue||Do you ever wish you had more close friends?
Dialogue||Well... sure. I suppose I'd call us friends at this point. I mean, if you think so too.
Dialogue||No, never. People are distracting.[]Friends and family make a lot of people happy, but it's just different for me. Nobody seems to understand that.
Dialogue||That doesn't sound very friendly.
Dialogue||I'm glad to hear you say that, Claude!
Dialogue||That's about as friendly as I get, XX. You can take it or leave it.
Dialogue||Thanks for not teasing me about it.
Dialogue||Everyone needs somebody in their life.
Dialogue||Everyone finds happiness in their own way.
Dialogue||Apparently, you're one of those people who don't get it.
Dialogue||That's exactly right. It looks like you're both thoughtful and fashionable.
Dialogue||I've changed some over the years, but the cool sea breeze is always the same.					
Dialogue||Isn't there something else you need to do right now?										
Dialogue||Feel free to take my minecart into the mines. Just don't forget to bring it back.						
Dialogue||Oh, did you see that? The wind just blew in a little circle... what could it mean?																																																												
Dialogue||If you've eaten any meat at the tavern recently, you can thank me for that.																										
Dialogue||Sorry, I'm quite busy.
Dialogue||Hey there, XX. I hope you're doing well these days.																																																																																																															
Dialogue||You always smell like fresh soil. I love it!									
Dialogue||These days all I want to do is hang with you instead of just doing my own thing. I think you broke me, XX!
Dialogue||You know, I'm surprised you're doing so well in a real relationship.
Dialogue||Is Donovan... losing his edge??
Dialogue||That sounds almost like a compliment, but also kind of like an insult. I know you're not trying to hurt my feelings, right?
Dialogue||What? No way!![]There's nothing wrong with wanting a little time to relax - juuuust a little! But maybe you don't get a lot of time for that, being a farmer. That's rough!
Dialogue||I just mean, it seems like this is new to you.
Dialogue||I'm only saying that I appreciate the effort.
Dialogue||Aw man, is it that obvious? I was trying to play it cool.[]Yeah, being in a real relationship is kind of weird for me. But I'm having fun!
Dialogue||I like the hard work.
Dialogue||You're right, it's terrible.
Dialogue||You would say something like that. We have some real different ideas about how to make a living, that's for sure.[]But if we're both happy then who cares!
Dialogue||If you hate it that much then you should make a change. Who says you have to be a farmer? Go exploring or... I don't know, fishing or something.
Dialogue||... Hm? Oh - pardon me, XX. I was in another world, thinking about music.
Dialogue||You still haven't told me much about your music.
Dialogue||Do you ever share your music?
Dialogue||I don't know what to tell you. I make it, it comes out wrong, I make it again.
Dialogue||I don't share my music with anybody.
Dialogue||Nothing great ever happened on the first try.
Dialogue||Maybe you should just move on to another project.
Dialogue||There's truth to that, even if it's kind of an annoying truth. I'll try to remember that, XX.
Dialogue||Thanks XX, but I don't need you to tell me how to give up. I already know how to do that.
Dialogue||Wouldn't it be helpful to have other people listen to it?
Dialogue||If you ever want an outside opinion on your work, I'm happy to help.
Dialogue||It's about meeting my own standards, XX. What do I care what other people think?
Dialogue||I guess you're probably my first choice at this point. I don't want to get your hopes up, though.
Dialogue||You're looking pretty buff, XX. Is that from farming or fighting?[]Either way, keep it up and you'll have nothing to fear in this town!
Dialogue||You seem pretty fearless, but I wonder... what scares you, Donovan?
Dialogue||Is there anybody in town that you would be afraid to fight?
Dialogue||Okay sure, I'll tell you. But only because we're getting to know each other pretty well. And you have to keep it quiet. This is a test to see if I can trust you, XX! Don't blow it.
Dialogue||Hm... Not Darius... Not Xyla... Maybe Arianella, the seamstress... Actually, the only person I can think of is you, XX.
Dialogue||You can trust me.
Dialogue||Out with it already.
Dialogue||I can't swim to save my life. For some reason, I sink like a bag of rocks. I just can't keep my head above water.[]Maybe I need to gain some weight or something. Anyway, now you know. So don't tell!
Dialogue||You're right, I would cream you.
Dialogue||I wouldn't want to fight you, Donovan!
Dialogue||Whoa whoa whoa - that's not what I meant at all! Good to know where you stand though, sheesh.
Dialogue||That's exactly my point, I think I actually like you too much. Heck, I'd rather get crushed by the club bouncer than have to fight you.
Dialogue||Solon is having me craft a set of very intricate gauntlets! It's precise work so I'm trying really hard not to mess it up.
Dialogue||"Gauntlets," those are a suit of armor's gloves, right?
Dialogue||Why did Solon give you such a hard task?
Dialogue||That's right. They go on the hands, so there's all the little finger pieces I have to do, and the palm measurements have to be super accurate.[]It's making me anxious just thinking about it, but I want to do my best.
Dialogue||Solon says he sees a lot of potential in me, and that makes me really happy. But I also think he's testing me, and what if I fail?! Oh, XX, I can barely stand to think about it!
Dialogue||I'm sure you're more than capable.
Dialogue||Just do your best. If you mess up, you mess up.
Dialogue||Thanks for the vote of confidence, XX. I'm really scared that Solon won't like what I make, but I still really want to meet his expectations.[]In a way, that leaves me feeling... excited.
Dialogue||I like your way of looking at it, XX. I'm really scared that Solon won't like what I make, but I still really want to meet his expectations.[]In a way, that leaves me feeling... excited.
Dialogue||You're going to fail if you don't relax.
Dialogue||Be honest with Solon and tell him you're having trouble.
Dialogue||I know! That's just making it impossible for me to calm down! I should just tell Solon I'm not ready for this. He'll be dissappointed, probably...
Dialogue||D-do you really think I should do that? He is my teacher, after all. Maybe he'll understand, or even help me out. Hmm, it's a little scary, but I think you're right, XX![]Or, at least, I hope you're right...
Dialogue||Hi XX. You look far off... Something on your mind?
Dialogue||Topi and Pod have me thinking. What's your favorite childhood memory?
Dialogue||Speaking of far off... If you could travel anywhere, where would it be?
Dialogue||I don't really have an answer. Look, I had a rough childhood. I didn't have birthday parties or lollipops whenever I scraped my elbows. And in case my tone isn't clear, I don't like getting into it.
Dialogue||That's easy, the Southern Region. I've always wanted to live in a tropical paradise, and the water there is warm enough to swim in every day. I can already see my cabana on the beach!
Dialogue||I'm sure there was someone who could have helped you.
Dialogue||If you ever do want to talk, you can talk to me.
Dialogue||How can you say that when you don't even know what happened? Don't try to help people who don't ask for it, XX.
Dialogue||Thanks for the offer, I guess. Jun has tried to squeeze it out of me before but he's so... tender. He means well, but it annoys me. I appreciate what you said though, XX. I'll keep it in mind.
Dialogue||Do you think you would continue working as a merchant?
Dialogue||Why do you want to live on the islands?
Dialogue||Of course! My plan is to have a partner in the north send me items that I can label as "exotic" in the south. Then I could open a shop that's small but with high-value goods.[]Low work, high payoff. That's the life!
Dialogue||The Southern islanders know how to live! They work the days and celebrate the nights. Plus, the islands get a lot of tourists.[]It's the perfect work-life balance - work off the tourists and live with the natives.
Dialogue||My family mailed me a package of my mother's homemade honeycakes. I was going to share them with everyone, but I... kinda ate the entire box. They were just so good!
Dialogue||You ate an entire box of cakes?!
Dialogue||So your mom is a baker, huh? I thought she was a blacksmith.
Dialogue||It isn't like I meant to!! It just made me realize how much I miss my family back home. Even if Liam is twice the baker my mom could ever be, it's like I could taste the love.
Dialogue||Well, my mother bakes. She isn't really a 'baker' like Liam. I have a cousin who is a pretty good baker, but he ended up moving away up to a bigger village.[]When I'm a master smith, I always wanted to travel up there and pop in on him as a surprise! He'd never expect quiet little Lynn to do something like that!
Dialogue||Are you thinking about moving back home?
Dialogue||Everything tastes better when mom makes it.
Dialogue||No, I miss it sometimes, but I'm focused on Sun Haven for the time being.[]Maybe there'll come a day when I move back home, but it won't be until after I become a master smith!
Dialogue||Right? Now I'm super regretting that I ate them all myself!! I swear, next time she sends me something, you're going to be the first to try it! Well, after me, at least!
Dialogue||I'm sure he wouldn't want to be bothered like that.
Dialogue||The look on his face is going to be priceless!
Dialogue||We were actually really close growing up. I know he'd be thrilled to see me, so you probably don't know what you're talking about!
Dialogue||Tell me about it! I don't even think he knows I left the village, even. Busting into his bakery and flexing my master blacksmith skills on him? I bet he'd be likely to fall faint!
Dialogue||There's my little farmer! I don't know why, but it's adorable to me that you're a farmer.
Dialogue||Not everyone can live as freely as you do.
Dialogue||My job feeds a lot of people, you know.
Dialogue||Sure they can, it's easy. All I do is take jobs as they come. What's hard about that? People need help with stuff all the time.
Dialogue||I know, you're a total provider! I'm not making fun of you or anything. I just think it's cute.
Dialogue||I don't think it's smart to live without steady work.
Dialogue||People would be happier if they lived like you.
Dialogue||Maybe there's better things in life than being smart. Dating me sure isn't smart, but here you are!
Dialogue||I've been saying that for years! Everyone could stand to loosen up a bit.
Dialogue||I can't tell if you're making fun of me.
Dialogue||I guess I'll take that as a compliment?
Dialogue||Ah, shoot. I don't mean to be a jerk. I just see you making your living and compare it to my life. I guess it's funny how different people's lives are... well, different.
Dialogue||Oh? Are you a new neighbor, or have I just forgotten your name?
Dialogue||My name is XX, I'm the new farmer here.
Dialogue||Of course you are! Well I'm delighted to meet you, XX. Call me Albert, 'cause that's my name!
Dialogue||You're less an outsider every day, XX.																											 									
Dialogue||After all this time together, I only feel closer than ever with you, XX. I don't know how I could get any happier.
Dialogue||Have you ever been this close with someone before?
Dialogue||Jun, more and more I feel like we were meant for each other. 
Dialogue||I'm curious... What if I had been? How would that make you feel?
Dialogue||I strongly believe in fate and I'm sure that my fate is with you. XX, let's allow our destinies play out.
Dialogue||That might be a disappointment, but nothing I couldn't move past.
Dialogue||I wouldn't mind - you're your own person.
Dialogue||Thank you for your honesty. Don't worry XX, I've only had passing fancies in my time. I've never connected with anyone like you before.
Dialogue||A very healthy mindset. XX, I have a suspicion you would make a good counselor yourself![]To answer your question, I've only had passing fancies in my time. I've never connected with anyone like you before.
Dialogue||I don't believe in fate at all.
Dialogue||Fate definitely brought us together!
Dialogue||Well, that's not very romantic...
Dialogue||And nothing in this world will break us apart, XX. Nothing.
Dialogue||The intruder. Whatever can I do for you?
Dialogue||Do you like serving the Demon King?
Dialogue||... Is your hair magic?
Dialogue||I'm well-equipped for the position and always ready to take on a challenge. There's no task the Demon King has given me that I couldn't handle yet.
Dialogue||All of me is magic, being that I'm a practitioner of water magic. I understand that my hair is distracting, but you could show a little self-control.
Dialogue||Being good at your job isn't the same as enjoying it.
Dialogue||You must have a brilliant mind for the King to trust you.
Dialogue||I don't take childish sentiment to work. If that's how you make all your decisions, I'm amazed you got this far.
Dialogue||I know you're trying to flatter me. Just because you got in one good line doesn't mean we'll be friends.
Dialogue||What do you do with your magic?
Dialogue||When did you discover that you had magic abilities?
Dialogue||I incorporate water magic into my life every day. I use an enchantment to keep the rain away, then when Withergate gets too grimy I bring on a downpour to wash it clean.
Dialogue||It's not something I discovered so much as honed. I could always feel the magic inside me, it was just a matter of carefully drawing it out over time. Now, I have expert control of my abilities.
Dialogue||I've already tasked Xyla with designing your crown. It will be extravagant without match, and all the more once it's on your head.																																													 									
Dialogue||Lately a big, mean dog has been chasing my kittens, nyan!
Dialogue||Are your kittens okay?
Dialogue||You must really hate this dog.
Dialogue||They're all safe and sound right now, nya! The first time that dog came by, though, it was terrible! Kitty had to look everywhere for the kittens after they ran off!
Dialogue||I don't <i>hate</i> the doggy, even if it chases my kittens. Kitty has tried to make friends with dogs before, but it's so hard, nyan! They just wanna chase Kitty, usually![]Kitty has been friends with dog Amari before, so why can't cats and dogs get along?! 
Dialogue||Do you think your kittens are in danger?
Dialogue||I hope your kitties are okay!
Dialogue||Nya. It's fine, mostly. I always scoop them up quick quick when I hear the dog coming, now. Kitty has very good hearing, you know!
Dialogue||Dogs and cats getting along would be so cute.
Dialogue||Dogs and cats aren't supposed to get along.
Dialogue||See, nya? You get it, XX! Kitties and puppies being friends, friends, friends! Very cute, yes?
Dialogue||Nyan. That's not a great way to look at the world. It must be so sad, thinking you couldn't be someone's friend just because of how you are!
Dialogue||Let me clear something up - you're still not getting any discounts.																									
Dialogue||Hup-two-three-four, hup-two-three-four... Oh! Hey, didn't see you for a second. Sorry, my mind is kind of wandering right now.
Dialogue||What was that hup-two thing you were saying?
Dialogue||What has your mind wandering?
Dialogue||Ohh, was I saying it out loud again? Ah, Kitty heard me doing it once and she started repeating it for a whole week. I dunno if she was just being silly or making fun of me![]It's the beat we learned to march to when I attended military training in the Great City. It's drilled into my brain. I'll... never get rid of it.
Dialogue||I love my life and duty, but the daily grind can get a little dull. It gives me lots of time to think, but sometimes I end up daydreaming a bit.[]Heh, does that sound bad? Daydreaming on the job?
Dialogue||You did military training in the Great City?
Dialogue||You must mean you trained at the Military Academy.
Dialogue||Yeah! You're originally from the Great City, too, right? Maybe we passed by each other one day and never realized. Pretty crazy, huh?[]The Military Academy there is second to none. I was very fortunate to get in, all thanks to my mom. It was strict, but I survived. Came out better for it, too.
Dialogue||Oh right, you're originally from the Great City yourself, aren't you? So of course you know about the grand Military Academy.[]The Academy there is second to none. I was very fortunate to get in, all thanks to my mom. It was strict, but I survived. Came out better for it, too.
Dialogue||You're only human, it's fine to slip up a little.
Dialogue||You're way too lax to be captain of the guard.
Dialogue||Thanks for not being hard on me about it, XX. Good people like you are why I do what I do! The grind is always worth it, no matter how dull.[]Speaking of which, I need to get back to work... Hup-two-three-four...
Dialogue||Do you really mean that? I guess that puts things into perspective. Maybe I need to buckle down and stay more focused.
Dialogue||Hi, XX. You look distracted. Is there something on your mind?
Dialogue||Oh, I was just imagining being rich. What would you do if you were rich?
Dialogue||Actually, I was thinking... of asking you on a date.
Dialogue||I think I would buy a big house and start my own school. That would be a dream come true, actually.
Dialogue||XX... I've been hoping you would ask me that, but now I'm afraid I'm dreaming!
Dialogue||That's not a very fun answer.
Dialogue||That's very you, Jun!
Dialogue||No? Well I'm concerned with being more helpful than fun.
Dialogue||Ah, do you already know me so well? I'm flattered!
Dialogue||Actually Jun, I don't think this is the best time.
Dialogue||Don't be silly - this is real! What do you say?
Dialogue||And just like that, the dream becomes a nightmare...
Dialogue||Absolutely, this is exactly what I've wanted![]XX, let's meet outside my house tomorrow at 10:00 am.
Dialogue||Looking for tools? I'm always open! Erm, except for when I'm closed of course.																															
Dialogue||Seeing how you live your life, I'm starting to get it. Maybe.[]It doesn't look so bad, settling in one spot.
Dialogue||Now there's something I never thought I'd hear you say.
Dialogue||Where would you settle down, if you could?
Dialogue||Heh, me either. I guess I'm starting to rethink some things. It's new. And weird. XX, you're making me weird.
Dialogue||The sewer isn't good enough? No actually, you're probably right... I don't really want to spend the rest of my life surrounded by rats. Even if they're fun to scare away.
Dialogue||You're finally growing up.
Dialogue||I couldn't make you any weirder than you already are.
Dialogue||I don't know if you meant it, but hearing that you think I'm childish is pretty brutal.
Dialogue||You're one to talk! You met me in a city that was rumored to be full of "vicious monsters," remember? Only a real weirdo would go looking for a place like that!
Dialogue||You didn't answer the question!
Dialogue||I was hoping you'd say something like that.
Dialogue||I guess if I could choose any place, it would be someplace with a lot of nature. The city is fun and all, but there are too many rules. I need more space.[]Actually, a farm wouldn't be half bad. 
Dialogue||I guess if I could choose any place, it would be someplace with a lot of nature. The city is fun and all, but there are too many rules. I need more space.[]Actually, a farm wouldn't be half bad.
Dialogue||Looks like you're making yourself right at home in Sun Haven! It took me a while to really get comfortable here as a native.
Dialogue||So what brought you to Sun Haven to begin with?
Dialogue||Did you ever go to see Elios on Dragon's Meet?
Dialogue||You could say my work brought me here. But really, I just needed a change. There came a time when I realized that the island just wasn't home to me anymore.
Dialogue||No, I haven't visited the Sun Dragon. When I first arrived here, Lucia told me that I should wait a while before seeing him.[]I don't see what Elios would do for me, anyway. I don't mean any disrespect, but I don't use magic - I'm a doctor. I stick to what I know.
Dialogue||You must miss your family and friends, though.
Dialogue||Do you ever wonder how the island managed without you?
Dialogue||These days, I keep myself looking forward. No point in looking back when there's a beautiful future ahead. I'm sure you can relate, having just moved here yourself.
Dialogue||I'm sure Elios could help your practice, somehow.
Dialogue||You seem to know what's best for yourself, I'd trust your instincts.
Dialogue||I don't mean to offend you, but you just don't know what you're talking about.
Dialogue||Thank you, XX. Sure, the idea that Elios can magically make your life better is appealing, but it's not helpful to me.
Dialogue||It takes someone special to capture my attention, XX. And now you've captured so much more than that!
Dialogue||I don't like to think that I've "captured" you.
Dialogue||You don't feel restricted by our marriage? 
Dialogue||I only meant it as an expression, but I see your point. Maybe a better word is "won."[]Oh, but does that make me sound like too much of a prize?
Dialogue||I might, if it were with anyone else. But you've always encouraged my freedom, XX. More than that, you've inspired me to thrive in it.[]Heh, sorry if I'm getting too serious. I get carried away with you!
Dialogue||A prize is exactly what you are!
Dialogue||We could always just say, "married!" 
Dialogue||Ah! XX, you're such a jokester! I'm going to get smile lines because of you.
Dialogue||I guess that's easiest, huh? Heh, with how much you make me smile, XX, I see smile lines in my future.
Dialogue||You can get a little intense sometimes.
Dialogue||I like it when you get carried away.
Dialogue||Apologies, XX. I didn't know it bothered you. I always thought you could handle my spirit, but I suppose I was wrong.
Dialogue||And you manage to build my spirit up even more! I'm lucky to have found someone exactly as passionate as me.
Dialogue||A new face? I'm Lester, it's great to meet you!
Dialogue||I'm XX. It's nice to meet you too.
Dialogue||You said XX? Unique name!  
Dialogue||Hey there, "business partner."									
Dialogue||Emma is shortest but only by a tiny bit.							
Dialogue||Hello, XX. Another fine day in Nel'Vari, isn't it?																																																																																																											
Dialogue||It's my dream to explore every cave in the world!																																													
Dialogue||Hey XX, I was just thinking about you. Actually, you've been on my mind a lot lately.
Dialogue||Oh yeah? I hope they've been good thoughts.
Dialogue||I've been thinking about you a lot, too.
Dialogue||They definitely have been. In fact XX, I was hoping we could go out on another date soon.
Dialogue||I trust that you're not thinking poorly of me, but the little voice in my head can't help but worry.
Dialogue||Actually Wornhardt, I don't think we should.
Dialogue||That sounds wonderful!
Dialogue||Oh... Lost interest, huh? That's okay. It happens.
Dialogue||Fantastic! Meet me at my house tomorrow at 5:00 pm. XX, this is going to be great!
Dialogue||Don't worry Wornhardt, I only have positive thoughts about you.
Dialogue||Sometimes I do think of you in a romantic way.
Dialogue||Heh... you don't know how much of a relief it is to hear you say that.
Dialogue||Oh? Well now I'm really curious! If it's gushy romantic stuff, you don't need to be embarrassed.[]We're adults, XX. We've all seen gushy romance before, and we all know how embarrassing it is!
Dialogue||Hey now, there's my favorite farmer! I hope you have a long and successful stint on the farm, XX.
Dialogue||Do you consider yourself successful, Wornhardt?
Dialogue||So what's your plan for the long term, Wornhardt?
Dialogue||Wow, that's a hefty question. Let me think a moment...[]You know, I think I do. Mainly because I found a place I'm happy to call home. That's all the success I need.
Dialogue||Long term, huh? I'll be honest with you. I'm still kind of getting myself settled into life here. I haven't thought one bit about any far future. I'm really just trying to enjoy the moment.
Dialogue||You're a surprisingly simple guy, Wornhardt. 
Dialogue||I hope to find success the way you have.
Dialogue||Thanks, but you might not think that once you get to know me better!
Dialogue||Just hang in there, XX. I'm completely certain that you'll find your success someday soon.
Dialogue||That's pretty irresponsible, especially for a doctor.
Dialogue||Focusing on the present is important.
Dialogue||What's irresponsible is expecting too much of yourself - and others.
Dialogue||We both agree on that! It's easy to get caught up in life and forget to enjoy yourself.[]Remember our date by the windmills? Now <i>that</i> was enjoying the moment.
Dialogue||I'm actually very quick but this armor is really heavy.																																																																																						
Dialogue||Hello there, farmer. Do you hear the birds today? There are so many songs to listen to![]Anyway, what's on your mind?
Dialogue||Are you seeing anybody in town, Wornhardt?
Dialogue||Wornhardt, I want to ask you... on a date!
Dialogue||Me? Oh, no. I mean, some people have certainly caught my eye, but I don't really put myself "out there" if you know what I mean.
Dialogue||Oh! Haha, that's the last thing I was expecting! It sounds fun to me, I guess I'm just a little surprised that you're interested.
Dialogue||You know, you could change that whenever you want!
Dialogue||You don't seem like the type of person to do that.
Dialogue||Oh! Really, you think? I guess I am a doctor, after all. Who knows, maybe now is the right time for me to get "out there."
Dialogue||I'm... not sure how to take that?
Dialogue||So, what do you say?
Dialogue||Maybe it's not the best idea after all.
Dialogue||XX, of course I'd like to go out with you! Why don't we meet out front of the hospital at 10:00 am tomorrow?
Dialogue||Oh no? Hm, that's disappointing. But, I'm glad you thought it through.
Dialogue||Hey, good lookin'!
Dialogue||So should I call you sweetie now?
Dialogue||Being together is a relief - I was getting tired of flirting.
Dialogue||Call me anything other than Anne, and I'll buy your farm out from under you. Then you'll be farmless!
Dialogue||Yeah, I was getting tired of your flirting too!
Dialogue||There's no way you could afford that.
Dialogue||I would laugh, but I know you really could.
Dialogue||Don't make me prove you wrong, XX!
Dialogue||You're smart. I actually thought about buying that land a while back. Good thing I didn't or you wouldn't have a home.
Dialogue||Hey, that's uncalled for!
Dialogue||Wait, was I bad at flirting?
Dialogue||Relax, I'm just messing with you. I'm glad we're done playing games, too. Being together is loads easier.
Dialogue||Brewing takes patience and care, just like grooming but with grains instead of hairballs.																																																																						
Dialogue||Hey sweetie, don't forget to take some time off your feet today. 																																			
Dialogue||You know much about fishin'? I know too much. I'd teach you a thing or two, but my teachin' days are behind me. Too old now - or at least that's my excuse, eheh.
Dialogue||Do you ever feel like you're wasting time?
Dialogue||Don't you do anything other than fish?
Dialogue||Eheh, I used to think just like that when I was younger. Funny, now that I'm old I just don't care. Maybe seems sorry to you, but for me it's real liberating.
Dialogue||I suppose every night I go to bed. Does that count?[]Ah, but why justify myself? I fish! Don't gotta explain any more than that.
Dialogue||It looks like you've found a happy life for yourself, at least.
Dialogue||I hope I'm not so lazy when I'm your age.
Dialogue||Ain't nothin' secret about it. Just find what you love and do it. I dunno if I loved fishin' so much to start with, but it sure passes the time. Beats workin' anywhere else, that's for sure!
Dialogue||Kid, you ain't even been around long enough to know what you want. Give it a few decades and if you're lucky enough to still be around, then you can decide.[]Until then, you go about your busy days and I'll go about keepin' this hook in the water.
Dialogue||You must be pretty good at fishing, at least.
Dialogue||Who's better at fishing then, you or Peter?
Dialogue||Oh I'm sure there's better fishers out there somewhere. Way I see it, why compete with people I don't know? Bein' the best fisher in Sun Haven would do me just fine.[]So far as I can compare, I'd say I'm indeed pretty good at fishin'. The best? Maybe! It's all I do, so I better be pretty good at it!
Dialogue||Hm. Hard to say. Peter isn't a half bad angler. Tell you what, next time I see Peter I'll challenge him to a fish-off. See which one of us catches the most.[]Then again, my memory ain't what it used to be. Chances are I'll forget all about it by tomorrow, eheh.
Dialogue||I'm bad with compliments, but you look really good today.
Dialogue||Are there any spots outside of your house that you like?
Dialogue||I had fun on our date the other day. We should do that again!
Dialogue||There's a waterfall below the cliff outside my house. Sometimes I sit there when I need to clear my head.
Dialogue||Oh, you're being serious? Sorry, I just thought you must be joking.[]Okay then, if you want that XX then I'd be happy to.
Dialogue||I knew it would be something like that!
Dialogue||That doesn't count.
Dialogue||Hey, it's a pretty spot. I can admire a lot of your farm from there, too.
Dialogue||Have you met me? I don't go places.
Dialogue||Actually, maybe we shouldn't.
Dialogue||I'm completely serious, Claude!
Dialogue||Ah, I see. I knew something like this would happen.
Dialogue||In that case, meet me at my house again. Let's say 12:00 pm tomorrow. We can have a sort of picnic... outside.
Dialogue||Withergate is especially lively these days. Maybe we have you to thank for that, XX.																																																																																																			 									
Dialogue||I've got a busy day so unless you're giving free back massages, you should keep walking.																							
Dialogue||It may be a cold night, XX. If you need help starting a fire, I need only cast a simple spell. Don't be afraid to ask!
Dialogue||Actually, I wanted to ask you about your magic. When did you discover it?
Dialogue||What do you like most about your magic?
Dialogue||Don't worry, most people have questions when they meet me.[]I became Blessed when I was eight years old. My magical abilities strengthened dramatically, though I'll admit there was a bit of a learning curve.[]This was long before I had any skill with magic. That is to say, it was completely out of my control.[]Thankfully, my late grandfather taught me some control. Those times spent training with him as a child are some of my most cherished memories.
Dialogue||Oh, it's certainly useful for everyday things. But more than that, it has earned me respect as a young leader.[]Having been blessed by Elios, Sun Haven's citizens rallied behind me as a strong user of magic. Being Blessed shows not only power, but discipline and competence.[]Pod even called me his "guiding light!" It was just darling!
Dialogue||It seems irresponsible to give that power to a child.
Dialogue||No wonder you're so skilled with it!
Dialogue||I wouldn't go that far, XX. Elios never acts in ignorance and only does what is best for Sun Haven. He knew I was to become a powerful leader for the people of this town.
Dialogue||Controlling my magic has been a lifelong journey, one that I'm still on. Over time, I developed a profound relationship with magic.[]That journey helped me become the leader I needed to be for Sun Haven - an Archmage.
Dialogue||What everyday things can be done with fire magic?
Dialogue||Do you think your job is easier because of your magic?
Dialogue||Well firstly, I never need a lantern. I also power the lighthouse with a charm that lasts through each night.[]Oh yes, and I keep all of the torches in town alight when it rains. It's actually quite fun for me to walk through the rain and hear it sizzle away on my skin.
Dialogue||Certainly, it gives me an advantage. However, Sun Haven needs any and all advantages it can get right now.
Dialogue||Even when it's struggling, Sun Haven is a gorgeous town. And having you here makes it that much better!
Dialogue||Are you worried about Sun Haven, with the monster town nearby?
Dialogue||Do you have a favorite spot in town?
Dialogue||Are you talking about Withergate? I'm not worried about monsters attacking the city, if that's what you're asking. I am concerned for Sun Haven's people, though.[]It's never good when tensions are high throughout a whole community.
Dialogue||It isn't very exciting, but I love my home. I have a bench to sit on outside, and when the sun sets over the wheat field... is it silly to call that my happy place?
Dialogue||People will just panic and make things worse.
Dialogue||I have faith in the people here.
Dialogue||I can't say I agree. You'd be surprised how good people can be when given the chance. I hope you get to see that goodness in action soon, because it sounds like you need it.
Dialogue||I agree wholeheartedly. Sun Haven is blessed with thoughtful and caring citizens. Like you, XX.
Dialogue||I don't think it's silly - it sounds beautiful!
Dialogue||Isn't there anywhere else you like to go?
Dialogue||You're welcome to come by, then. I can't think of a better way to spend time with yourself than in a quiet, beautiful space. I'm lucky to call it my home.
Dialogue||Well, I can just barely peep the top of your farmhouse from my home. Honestly, your farm looks really peaceful too - at least from what I've seen.
Dialogue||I thought marriage would be scary, but it really isn't. Not with you, XX.																																																				
Dialogue||I'd usually love to chat, but I have to fly. We'll talk soon, I promise.				
Dialogue||Hello, XX. Have a wonderful day.
Dialogue||Aren't you just a busy bee!
Dialogue||Farmer! Are you here for playtime?
Dialogue||Maybe next time, Pod.
Dialogue||What is your favorite game?
Dialogue||Aw, boring. You should play more, then you wouldn't be so boring.
Dialogue||I love tag the most. I'm really good at it, especially when we play hide-and-tag.
Dialogue||I can't play because I'm too busy with work.
Dialogue||I can't play because I'm... going to fight monsters!
Dialogue||I wanted you to be a fun grown up. You're just a regular grown up though.
Dialogue||No way! Real live monsters, not just pretend??[]Topi is scared of monsters, but not me.
Dialogue||What do you like most about tag?
Dialogue||What's your best hiding spot?
Dialogue||I get to run around a lot. Topi is faster than me but I fit under the bushes where he can't get me!
Dialogue||No way, I won't tell you or you'll tell Topi. 
Dialogue||XX! Are you happy to see me? I'm happy to see you, of course!
Dialogue||Kitty, I have a special question for you. Do you want to go on a date?
Dialogue||Are you okay? You look anxious.
Dialogue||A date? With XX, and Kitty? For real, nya?
Dialogue||Kitty's excited! I have a surprise for you, XX. A gift from me!
Dialogue||Yes, for real!
Dialogue||Actually Kitty, I think it's a mistake.
Dialogue||OH MY GOSH! Yes XX, nyaaa! You can meet me in front of my house in the morning at 10:00 am for our first date!
Dialogue||Oh no, is it my fault? Whatever it was, I didn't mean it...
Dialogue||You got me something?
Dialogue||Thanks Kitty! What is it?
Dialogue||I made it myself! It's a toy to keep you from getting bored, nya. It's my favorite one, and it's for you because you're my favorite friend! Here, take it take it!
Dialogue||Well hello there, I haven't seen you around yet. I'm Cynthia, it's a pleasure.
Dialogue||Hi Cynthia, I'm XX.
Dialogue||XX, why does that name sound familiar? Oh well, who knows.[]Come to me if you need a little help in the romance department. I'm sure I can lend a hand!
Dialogue||I carry my whole brewing station with me wherever I go. Yes, it is quite heavy!																																																																						
Dialogue||You're so small.											
Dialogue||XX? You're... <i>gazing</i> at me. It's almost romantic, though. Almost.
Dialogue||I've been thinking about our future.
Dialogue||Anne, are you happy with our relationship?
Dialogue||Our future? I've got a plan for my own future, XX.[]If your future plan joins with mine, then great! But I'm not changing course anytime soon.
Dialogue||Whoa - that was out of the blue! What, you think I'll leave you for a business opportunity or something?[]Sure, my life is a constant race with money at the goal, but that's business. And I still want to race, you know?[]But now I have you and suddenly I find myself thinking of something other than the next big score.[]Wow... I wasn't even sure of that until I said it out loud!
Dialogue||I would expect nothing less from you, Anne.
Dialogue||I love that about you - you're as determined as a young dragon.
Dialogue||I feel like that can be taken either as an insult or a compliment, so I'll choose compliment!
Dialogue||Ooh, you said a young dragon? I like that! Maybe I should make that my shop's new insignia. 
Dialogue||Do you ever really stop thinking about money?
Dialogue||Maybe what you need is a partner in your race.
Dialogue||Nope. Never have, never will. If you ever want to have a life with me down the road, you have to consider that.
Dialogue||Aw, using my own analogy to say something sweet! Unoriginal, but sweet. I knew there was a reason I fell for you, XX.[]Maybe you're right - maybe I could use a partner like you in my race. But if you join me, it has to be for good.[]Are you getting the hint, XX? Well here's another - I could really use a new ring! 
Dialogue||I love seeing you around town, XX. You make Sun Haven a little more perfect!
Dialogue||I feel like I could tell you anything, Jun.
Dialogue||What does a perfect day look like for you?
Dialogue||I cherish the ability to gain someone's trust. People confide in me because I'm good at keeping secrets - really good. You can trust me more than anyone, XX.
Dialogue||Hm, good question. I'd most likely paint in the morning and walk around town in the afternoon. I enjoy seeing the people that I know just living their lives.[]Then in the evening, I would watch the sunset from my house with a nice, hearty salad.
Dialogue||You had my trust a long time ago.
Dialogue||On second thought, I'm not so sure.
Dialogue||To hear you say that... Well, the feeling is mutual. I don't have as many people to confide in as I have confiding in me, so I'm grateful to have you, XX.
Dialogue||I understand. Take your time, XX.
Dialogue||Everything about that screams, "Jun."
Dialogue||I can't think of a more perfect day.
Dialogue||Oh, I forgot something important! The day wouldn't be perfect without you in it, XX.
Dialogue||Have you met Iris yet? She was a big help with getting my house set up.
Dialogue||Why is your house so far away from everyone else?
Dialogue||Is she a good friend of yours?
Dialogue||I like it that way. It's a little quieter, a little more my own. It's important for me to have control of my own space.
Dialogue||Iris? Sure, we've known each other for many years. Without Iris, many of the buildings in town wouldn't have been possible to build - like my house.[]She's the second strongest magic user in Nel'Vari - other than me, of course.
Dialogue||That sounds a little isolated.
Dialogue||That kind of solitude does sound peaceful.
Dialogue||It is, but that's the point. Maybe you don't share the same appreciation for solitude that I do.
Dialogue||That certainly factors in. The peace and quiet have allowed me time to meditate and focus on myself.
Dialogue||You say you're stronger?
Dialogue||You said she helped build your house?
Dialogue||I only say that because I've mastered my practice. She's still learning the secrets of enchanting magic, I believe.
Dialogue||Maybe "build" isn't the right word. I had a vision of a home inside the trunk of a great tree, and she engineered it with her enchanting magic.
Dialogue||It's great to see you, XX... Whoa, you're staring pretty hard. Is something wrong?
Dialogue||I've been waiting a while to say this, but... you have some really great hair!
Dialogue||Sorry, I didn't mean to stare.
Dialogue||Oh! Hah, thank you. It actually grew out before I moved here, when I wasn't taking very good care of myself. But then I decided to keep it!
Dialogue||No harm done, XX. I know I can look a bit run down at times. That's to be expected after twelve years of medical work.
Dialogue||It definitely suits you. 
Dialogue||It looks like you're taking better care of yourself now. 
Dialogue||I'm glad you think so. It's always nice getting unexpected compliments.
Dialogue||Thanks! I must be having a really good hair day, haha!
Dialogue||Actually, I was going to say that you look pretty good!
Dialogue||It's nothing a good night's sleep can't fix.
Dialogue||Oh? Heh, you're a real charmer, XX! I hope we get to spend a lot of time together.
Dialogue||Oh? Hm. I wasn't really looking for that kind of advice, but thank you anyway.
Dialogue||Are the fish biting for you?
Dialogue||You're strong from farming, but I've gained some muscle from my work too. I wonder which of us is stronger... Oh, I don't mean that as a challenge!																																																																		
Dialogue||Hello, XX. Don't mind me, I was just recalling a memory of my grandfather.
Dialogue||Do you have any favorite memories of your training days?
Dialogue||Your grandfather must have been an extraordinary person.
Dialogue||Of course! All my memories with my grandfather are dear to me, though some stories really stick out, like this one time...[]Early in my training, it was obvious how talented I was. I got such an attitude! Grandfather proposed a challenge, and I eagerly accepted.[]I was challenged with igniting four torches, and to keep them all blazing simultaneously. I thought it sounded like a breeze, and went at it with all my power.[]...Which is exactly what Grandfather knew I'd do. In the end, I completely incinerated the torches in my attempt to keep them all aflame. I had little control of my magic.[]I'd completely failed the challenge, but the experience taught me a very important thing: humility. I'll never forget it.
Dialogue||He was indeed. Though he wasn't Blessed, as you and I are, it didn't stop him from applying basic, universal principles to my training.[]Those principles are what helped forge me, and I live by them to this day.
Dialogue||That was quite the story, Lucia. Thanks for sharing it.
Dialogue||Wow, you really do have some great stories to tell.
Dialogue||Don't mention it, XX. I love remembering my days with my grandfather. I should thank you for listening.
Dialogue||That's very touching, Lucia.
Dialogue||Yeah but he's gone now, so forget about it.
Dialogue||It is, isn't it? My grandfather and grandmother may be gone now, but I can keep them both alive by teaching others the lessons I learned from him.
Dialogue||You should really learn which thoughts are best kept to yourself, XX.
Dialogue||I'm soooo bored in school. The work is easy because I'm the oldest kid in class.
Dialogue||Are you the oldest kid in town ,too?
Dialogue||You could ask for more challenging work.
Dialogue||I'm the oldest, unless you count Kitty.
Dialogue||I guess... but what if it's too hard then?
Dialogue||Why would I count Kitty? 
Dialogue||Actually, I do count kitty. 
Dialogue||She acts funny. She even plays with us, sometimes!
Dialogue||You're smart, you'll figure it out.
Dialogue||Then you work harder!
Dialogue||If it means I'm less bored then maybe I will. Thanks, XX!
Dialogue||Nooooo XX, I don't want that at all.
Dialogue||Look at us, married! It's like a little story book - The Farmer and the Witch.[]Eh, maybe not.
Dialogue||I think "The Farmer and the Witch" sounds cute.
Dialogue||Is marriage everything you thought it would be?
Dialogue||Hehe, oh yeah? Then I guess this is the first chapter of our story together.
Dialogue||You know, I never thought about it that much. I only wanted to be in love and connect with someone on a deep level.[]I think I really have that with you, XX. So I suppose marriage really is everything I thought it would be! 
Dialogue||Let's make it's a fun story!
Dialogue||It will be the first of many.
Dialogue||Oh, XX. I was lucky to marry someone like you. I knew it all along. 
Dialogue||My connection to you is unlike anything else.
Dialogue||I don't really get what you mean.
Dialogue||That makes me so happy to know, XX. I knew you were the one I was meant to be with. 
Dialogue||Well, I can't expect everything about our marriage to be perfect. It's fine if you don't quite get what I mean, though I really wish you did.
Dialogue||Hey, you're that new farmer. Whatever you need, I can help - for a price![]Or are you just looking to chat?
Dialogue||You seem to like it here.
Dialogue||I don't think we were properly introduced. You're Anne?
Dialogue||What's not to like? Good weather means a lot of foot traffic, and a reputation as a trading hub sure doesn't hurt business either. Plus, I can enjoy the sunshine when business is slow.
Dialogue||Whoops, that's not the first time that's happened. Yep, I'm Anne, the best merchant in Sun Haven and don't let anybody tell you different!
Dialogue||It doesn't feel right to judge a town by the money it makes you.
Dialogue||I can appreciate a business-minded person like yourself.
Dialogue||I'm not sure, but it's definitely not right to judge people you just met.
Dialogue||You sound like you really get it. I look forward to seeing you around town - and I mean that in every sense!
Dialogue||Are you from Sun Haven originally?
Dialogue||What brought you to Sun Haven in the first place?
Dialogue||I got my start farther west. Traveled a lot for work. If you ask me, every big city is the same. Same people, same dirty streets, same same same.[]But then I heard about Sun Haven and thought, "That sounds different."[]It was a risk coming here, but risk often leads to reward. For me, anyway.
Dialogue||Solon had me working double-time yesterday. My shoulders are still sore...																																								
Dialogue||I can't wait to see you order around the castle guard. What a treat that shall be to see!																																																																								 									
Dialogue||Hi there. Here to practice your small talk?
Dialogue||So what made you choose to sell this stuff?
Dialogue||You help people find their partners?
Dialogue||I was always the matchmaker in my hometown, so I thought I'd take my talents on the road. Who knows how many families I've started along the way?
Dialogue||I can't find the partner for you, but I can make sure you're prepared when you do find them.
Dialogue||I doubt you have that much of an effect.
Dialogue||You're doing important work!
Dialogue||You don't even know what you're talking about - not until you try it yourself!
Dialogue||It feels good knowing that I make a difference wherever I go.
Dialogue||Oh, I see.
Dialogue||I'll take any help I can get!
Dialogue||Don't sound so down - finding love is what life is all about!
Dialogue||Exactly, I can't do it for you but I can help! That's my whole business model.
Dialogue||I made myself a witch, but you made me a wife. Now I'm a witch-wife! Which wife? Your wife!																																																																																					
Dialogue||If you're looking for help, go find Lester. He loves helping.			
Dialogue||Doing homework stinks...																																																																																																																																																																																																									
Dialogue||We're lucky to have so much rain here in Sun Haven. After a good rain, everything is all green and lush.																																																																																																																																										
Dialogue||It took me a long time to earn a reputation as a tough Demon here. I don't need you messing that up!																							
Dialogue||Be honest - does my armor look shinier today? I'm trying a new wax but I haven't noticed a difference.
Dialogue||Sheesh, you're cute... OH - did I say that out loud??																																																																																					
Dialogue||I really like how our armor looks, but boy does it get me sweating...									 					
Dialogue||Keep walking.						
Dialogue||I just started here a couple of weeks ago, so you're not the only newbie in town.								
Dialogue||Withergate is supposed to be a town full of monsters that live in constant darkness! Can you imagine?									
Dialogue||My wares are held at a high standard and a fair price. What more can you want?												
Dialogue||So you seem to be pretty good at earning tickets. Don't get an ego, you're just a bit less lazy than the average Withergate citizen!
Dialogue||Why does Withergate use tickets, anyways?
Dialogue||I worked hard for my tickets.
Dialogue||They're wonderful, right? So much easier to use than those gaudy gold coins the Humans love so much. Plus, they're perfect for our carnival![]Needless to say, I was the one who pitched the ticket idea to King Minos. I truly am the best!
Dialogue||Yeah, yeah. I'm sure you're very proud of all your 'hard' work, farmer. Do you have any idea how hard I work?[]One day in my shoes, and you'd be begging for your little farm back!
Dialogue||Paper money is a very novel idea.
Dialogue||Your idea seems to work for Withergate.
Dialogue||Looks like you're finally starting to get it. Sometimes you gotta think outside of the box to solve a problem, and no one does that better than me!
Dialogue||I work way harder than you.
Dialogue||Well you wouldn't last one <i>hour</i> on a farm.
Dialogue||Oh yeah? Name the first three things I do when I wake up every morning. What's that? You don't know what they are? Typical. Keep walking, outsider!
Dialogue||Ohh, big talk is my favorite kinda talk, XX. You aren't half-bad, for a stinky outsider.
Dialogue||Sorry, what did you say? I was off in my own world.
Dialogue||It's a good day to watch the windmills.						
Dialogue||Jun holds his classes in the back. I don't know how he deals with those shrieking kids every day.
Dialogue||Jun is a gentle kind of person, huh?
Dialogue||Is that also where he offers counseling?
Dialogue||You have to be if you're working with kids. Well, if you're <i>good</i> at working with kids.
Dialogue||It is, yes.[]It's not as private as he would like, but Jun manages to make some real breakthroughs back there.[]... I know that because, like I said, it's not the most private place.
Dialogue||I take it that kind of work doesn't appeal to you?
Dialogue||Were you loud as a kid?
Dialogue||I'm a librarian. My comfort zone is silence - you do the math.
Dialogue||As far as I can remember, nope. I used to draw and read a lot instead of running and screaming in circles.
Dialogue||You really shouldn't be eavesdropping on Jun.
Dialogue||So... do you like listening?
Dialogue||I can't help what I hear. I have ears! All I can do is sit here and read, pretending not to hear. 
Dialogue||I wouldn't say that. I mean, I don't mind overhearing Jun's talks...[]Okay fine, you caught me. Part of me enjoys listening in on his sessions. But it's not my fault! I can't help but overhear in the first place - it's not like I can turn my ears off.
Dialogue||I like to keep in shape. I try to exercise every day outside of work.																																																																																																																																																
Dialogue||I'm really glad we met on that train into town, XX. It's been really nice having a friend from the start.																									
Dialogue||Good day, XX. Have you gotten to know the town already? I'm still working on it.
Dialogue||Are you liking this town, Lynn?
Dialogue||Have you found any nice places in Sun Haven so far?
Dialogue||Well... I do miss my home, but everyone here is really really nice. Then again, Kitty can be a handful, and Anne scares me a little bit.[]Overall, I guess I was expecting it to be more active. What do you think?
Dialogue||I love being in the quarry, especially at sunset. Don't make fun of me, but I imagine all the ore hiding inside the rocks just waiting to be turned into beautiful armor.[]Plus, there's an echo!
Dialogue||I think Sun Haven is already on its way back up.
Dialogue||I think this town is on its way out.
Dialogue||Wow, do you think so? Who knows, maybe you're right. At least, I hope you're right, XX.
Dialogue||Oh, no, please don't say that - we must stay positive.
Dialogue||Why do you go at sunset?
Dialogue||I've never heard of someone so passionate about rocks!
Dialogue||The light at sunset makes all the rocks stand out. You can see the layers of rock in different colors - that's called stratification! I think it's gorgeous.
Dialogue||No fair, I said no teasing! But, well, you're not wrong either.
Dialogue||Jordan really saved me today. I forgot to do an egg wash on the bread last night, but he came in early and took care of it for me.
Dialogue||He really helps out, huh?
Dialogue||Are you being replaced as the town's best baker?
Dialogue||Jordan? Absolutely! I just wish I could pay him more... Anyway, he seems to genuinely like working in the bakery.
Dialogue||Heh, I don't know about that. But Jordan really is a skilled baker. I wouldn't be surprised if he opened his own shop one day!
Dialogue||He's a good friend.
Dialogue||You really should pay him better.
Dialogue||Yeah, I guess he is a friend![]I don't know why, but I've only ever thought of him as my coworker. But we've worked together for so long, how could we not be friends?
Dialogue||I'm paying all I can afford right now, XX. Please don't make me feel worse about it.
Dialogue||Wouldn't that be competition for you?
Dialogue||I'm glad you're supportive of him.
Dialogue||Oh. Right. Aw man, what if he bakes better bread than I do?[]I better start thinking of some specialty items... and I should stop telling Jordan all my recipes.
Dialogue||Yeah... wait, do you think that's a bad idea? What if he becomes my competition? And what if he bakes better bread than me?[]I better start thinking of some specialty items... and I should stop telling Jordan all my recipes.
Dialogue||I'm thinking about investing in some property around Sun Haven.
Dialogue||I didn't take you for a property dealer.
Dialogue||Which property were you looking at?
Dialogue||Only sometimes. It's profitable, but I prefer to be able to pick up and travel with my goods.[]Until I find someone versed in magic who knows how to move land, property is a firmly fixed asset.
Dialogue||The mines! Can you believe no one really owns it? Bernard at the town hall might sell me the deed of ownership. It's incredibly expensive, but just imagine![]I could charge an entry fee, a minecart fee, a charge for ore collection... so many options!
Dialogue||You should buy a farm, like me!
Dialogue||Someone that can move land? That's a wild idea!
Dialogue||Hm, no thanks. You of all people should know that land meant for farming needs considerable preparation and upkeep.[]I've no interest in hiring workers to turn undeveloped land into something worth reselling. And I'm sure not doing it myself!
Dialogue||Hey, I didn't entirely mean it as a joke. If someone can dream it, then they can do it. And then I can pay them to do it for me![]If there is someone out there who can actually move land, then I'll find them, contract them, and make a fortune!
Dialogue||What would we get in return for those fees?
Dialogue||That sounds greedy.
Dialogue||Well for starters, did you know the entire mine is dangerously unstable? It'll need to have support beams installed, which isn't cheap.[]And the minecart tracks haven't been cleaned or repaired since being laid down years and years ago.[]There's a lot of work to be done and it won't come cheap, but I can make it happen if I'm smart about it. 
Dialogue||I might charge people to use the mines, but then I'd also be responsible for making sure it's safe - something no one is doing.[]It's a lot more than just me making a quick buck, but thanks for assuming the worst of me XX.
Dialogue||I think the girls are planning to attack you with stickers the next time you're over. Don't say I didn't warn you!																		
Dialogue||It feels like seeing you has become part of my routine, like pruning my plants.
Dialogue||It must be a lot of work caring for all those plants.
Dialogue||I'm too eager to wait - let's go on another date!
Dialogue||Of course, but I love them! Plants are sensitive and reactive - just like people.[]I don't know, I guess sometimes I feel more connected to plants than people. That must sound weird...
Dialogue||Oh! XX, you're such a sweetheart. I'm flattered that you're thinking about me!
Dialogue||You're right, that's weird.
Dialogue||Not at all, there's a lot we can learn from plants.
Dialogue||See, this is why I prefer plants.
Dialogue||Exactly! I'm glad you agree. It makes me feel like less of an oddball.
Dialogue||Actually, I'm starting to think we should just be friends.
Dialogue||Is that so? Well jeez XX, that's pretty disappointing. But, I'm glad that we still get to be friends.
Dialogue||Absolutely, yes XX. Come by my house tomorrow at 5:00 pm. I can't wait!
Dialogue||... What? Something in my teeth?													
Dialogue||Everyone in Nel'Vari has their mind on the forest, but all I can think about lately is you, XX.				
Dialogue||Adding the old farm to my delivery route should boost my cardio nicely!																																																																																																																																																									
Dialogue||XX, my better half! Life in Sun Haven is perfect now that we're together.
Dialogue||Do you think people will talk about us?
Dialogue||How long do you expect to stay in Sun Haven?
Dialogue||Knowing the people in this town... most likely, yes. But what does it matter? I don't care a bit, personally.
Dialogue||Oh, I don't plan to leave ever. This town has my heart... like you. That isn't a problem, is it?
Dialogue||You're right, it shouldn't matter.
Dialogue||I can't help but think about it.
Dialogue||You've got a good head on your shoulders, XX.
Dialogue||If it really bothers you, just remember that it will pass. Gossip doesn't last forever, right?
Dialogue||Not at all - I feel the same way.
Dialogue||I can't imagine staying here forever.
Dialogue||You don't know how much of a relief it is to hear you say that.
Dialogue||Oh... Is that so? I'm surprised that you feel that way, XX.
Dialogue||You work real hard, don't you? I wonder if you've made as much money as I have since coming to Sun Haven!
Dialogue||How much money have you made?
Dialogue||What do you make all your money for, anyway?
Dialogue||Well, a good merchant never sells and tells. I'm not going to give up sensitive information like that![]Don't forget, information can fill a wallet just as quick as it can drain it.
Dialogue||At first, it was simple survival. But then I learned to like the taste of success and the comforts that come with it.
Dialogue||You're just being dramatic.
Dialogue||That's a smart precaution for a business owner.
Dialogue||Call it dramatic if you like, XX. I've been in the game a long time, so I know I'm not just blowing smoke. 
Dialogue||It might sound like I'm being dramatic, but I've been in the game a long time.  I know I'm not just blowing smoke.[]Oh, but it's not that I don't trust <i>you</i>, of course.
Dialogue||You're a very driven person. 
Dialogue||At least invest everything wisely.
Dialogue||True, but I still know how to have fun! I'll slow down some day. Maybe in the distant future, heh.
Dialogue||Wisely? XX, you're a farmer! You want me to invest in potatoes? Oh wait, I already did - it's called dinner!
Dialogue||Oh. The farmer, right?																	
Dialogue||Sore arms, sore back, sore legs, tired eyes... Smithing is a full-body workout.									
Dialogue||Oh? Sorry, you surprised me. We don't get many new faces around here. My name is Iris.
Dialogue||I didn't mean to surprise you. I'm XX.
Dialogue||XX, interesting name. If nobody has said it yet, welcome to Nel'Vari.
Dialogue||Familiarity is the best teacher. I recommend a weapon you have experience with.																								
Dialogue||Enjoying the day, farmer? It's beautiful weather to stand watch.
Dialogue||Do you get any time to relax?
Dialogue||You seem to take your position very seriously.
Dialogue||Sure, twenty minutes of relaxation time between dinner and sleep each night.[]Why are you looking at me like that? That's plenty of time.
Dialogue||That's what I have to do if I want to climb the ranks. Not everyone has promotions dropped into their lap. Some of us need to work harder to go the same distance.
Dialogue||If you ask me, you could use more time off.
Dialogue||Would you ever want a whole day off for yourself?
Dialogue||Sure, when I retire. In the meantime, my routine keeps me on the level.
Dialogue||I'm just saying you could loosen up a bit.
Dialogue||You handle yourself well, even under all that pressure.
Dialogue||I'm not surprised that you don't get it.
Dialogue||I know that, but it's nice of you to say.
Dialogue||One, two, make me a brew! Three, four, give us a pour! Heh, rhyming.																																																																			
Dialogue||I've heard people calling you farmer a lot. Do you like that? I think it's endearing!
Dialogue||Do you have any nicknames?
Dialogue||The people here really are nice.
Dialogue||Well... All right, XX. I'll tell you this because I'm starting to really trust you. But please don't repeat this![]My grandfather called me "cinderhead" when I was a child. Usually when I was getting up to mischief. And - just between us, XX! - I still call myself cinderhead sometimes.
Dialogue||The citizens are my favorite thing about Sun Haven. They make this town what it is. Without them, I would have no purpose here. What's a leader without people behind her?
Dialogue||What if I started calling you cinderhead?
Dialogue||I promise I'll keep your nickname a secret! 
Dialogue||I'm afraid that would necessitate a hostile response...[]I'm joking, XX! Though the look on your face was certainly satisfying.
Dialogue||I believe you, XX. I don't know why, but I felt a sense of trust in you the moment we met.
Dialogue||I'd like to get to know the people better.
Dialogue||A leader should be able to stand alone.
Dialogue||Oh, good![]Perhaps try to strike up conversations with more of your neighbors. Getting to know people is the best way to find one's place in a new community.
Dialogue||I don't mean to offend you, XX, but that is a truly ignorant statement. It's clear you've never been in a position of leadership.
Dialogue||Something smells fishy... oh, that's me.
Dialogue||I work mainly with plants, but animals are just as vital to the environment.																			
Dialogue||I love the carnival, but sometimes it feels like these carnival games are rigged... Really, I should win by default.
Dialogue||Why should you win?
Dialogue||Hey, the carnival was your doing.
Dialogue||Because it's <i>my</i> carnival! Without me, there wouldn't be any prizes to win in the first place. And now I can't even win one.[]Well forget it, I don't need any of those dumb plushies anyway.
Dialogue||Exactly! That's why it's so stupid that I can't win the darn games. I've seen Donovan walk out of rthe carnival grounds with his arms full of toys. What's he doing that I'm not??
Dialogue||Just be better at the games!
Dialogue||I'll win one for you.
Dialogue||Heh, of course! It's so simple![]Thanks for showing me the light, XX. I don't know what I'd do without the advice of a sewer rat like you.
Dialogue||Ugh, that's all I need. A farmer making me look bad at my own carnival.
Dialogue||Maybe he's just better than you at carnival games.
Dialogue||Maybe he's cheating.
Dialogue||Hmph. I don't have time to practice these games all day. It must be nice, not working a steady job. I really don't know how that fleabag survives here.
Dialogue||Maybe... nah, that doesn't seem like his style. I don't know him too well but he doesn't seem dishonest to me.
Dialogue||Can you believe that some people have never set foot underground? Honest!												
Dialogue||Hey XX. Have you put on some muscle? You look really good!
Dialogue||I haven't asked, what kind of music do you listen to?
Dialogue||So when are we going out again?
Dialogue||I don't have many records, but I like anything with a good rhythm. Something you can move your body to, you know what I mean?
Dialogue||You really think you're in for a second date, huh? Just like that?
Dialogue||Sounds like you need to expand your tastes.
Dialogue||We should hit the dance floor sometime!
Dialogue||I have the best taste in town, thanks very much.
Dialogue||Wow, a farmer AND a dancer? You must fancy yourself quite the catch!
Dialogue||Of course I do!
Dialogue||Actually, maybe that's not the best idea.
Dialogue||Then let's do it! Come by my cart at 4:00 pm tomorrow.
Dialogue||Oh... really? Well, all right then XX. If that's what you think.
Dialogue||Yesterday a man flew out of the sky! I told Lucia but I don't think she believed me...
Dialogue||I believe you!
Dialogue||What did this person want?
Dialogue||Yeah? I knew you would believe Kitty, XX! Thank you for always being good to me, nya.[]The man said his name was Vaan. He was an Elf from the forest!
Dialogue||I don't think he wanted anything, nya. He said he was only visiting. But he hid from the guards when they came by, and then he left! He was a funny guy, hehe.
Dialogue||Okay, now your story is getting a little far fetched.
Dialogue||I hope he was nice to you.
Dialogue||Nyan!? You don't believe me after all...
Dialogue||He was very nice indeed, yep! He asked me what I do here. And then he gave me some greenroot, yuck!
Dialogue||It's weird that he didn't want anything.
Dialogue||I can't blame him for wanting to visit!
Dialogue||I had the same thought after he left. I guess Sun Haven is popular to everyone - even sky Elves!
Dialogue||Me neither, nya! I had the same thought after he left. Sun Haven is popular to everyone - even sky Elves!
Dialogue||Good day, XX. I have a spot of free time if you would like to chat.[]Is there anything you'd like to know?
Dialogue||I'm curious... what's your favorite dessert?
Dialogue||So is your hair naturally red, or is that magic too?
Dialogue||There's a delectable dish I've only ever found in other regions. It's called moon cream pie. If you have the opportunity to try it, I recommend that you do!
Dialogue||I will never understand the people's fascination with my hair. Catherine's hair is much more colorful!
Dialogue||I don't get it. What's it like?
Dialogue||Is it really that hard to find? 
Dialogue||It's like... Oh, this almost certainly sound like nonsense... But it tastes like sweet moonlight. Imagine a cream that is so fluffy that it makes you feel lighter when you eat it.
Dialogue||I once asked Liam to try making it, but it didn't come out quite right. Oh, but let's keep that between us![]I didn't want to hurt his feelings, so I told him it was perfect. I know I shouldn't have lied, but I couldn't crush Liam like that.
Dialogue||You're right, her hair is prettier than yours.
Dialogue||Sure, but yours looks like actual fire.
Dialogue||I didn't quite mean that...
Dialogue||Well... thank you. I admit that it is a coincidence, but it's nothing more than that.
Dialogue||Hello. Um, who are you?
Dialogue||I'm XX, the new farmer.
Dialogue||Oh that's right! Nathaniel briefed us on the new arrival. My name is Pinto.
Dialogue||You run the farm now, right? That explains the dirty footprints.
Dialogue||The animals seem extra playful today, nya!																														
Dialogue||I was soaring over the forest when I heard some delightful music. It was coming from that big house by the wheat field in Sun Haven. Do you know the one?
Dialogue||Do you like that kind of music?
Dialogue||That's Claude's house.
Dialogue||It was very unlike Elven music, for sure. But it was calming. A very pleasant surprise to find in the clouds above the forest!
Dialogue||Claude? Is he the broody one with the blonde hair? I think I've seen him before. I wouldn't have taken him for a musician.
Dialogue||I don't like that kind of music.
Dialogue||I can't imagine a better place to listen to music.
Dialogue||Oh? You must prefer loud music. Too much noise makes it difficult to meditate, but to each their own.
Dialogue||It really was a perfect moment, even if it was just a moment. 
Dialogue||Why not?
Dialogue||"Broody" is one way to describe him. 
Dialogue||Most of the musicians I know are mushrooms... But besides that, he doesn't look very happy.[]In Nel'Vari, the best crafters are the happiest ones. You can feel their happiness in their work. To create from a place of sadness sounds wrong to me, but maybe it's just a Human thing.
Dialogue||I don't mean to judge him harshly. I've just never seen a smile on his face, I don't think.[]Can you imagine, never smiling? That would be so sad, and boring!
Dialogue||I'm fine today, thanks. Just stretching my legs before I go back to work... where I stand all day.						
Dialogue||I've heard people talking about this monster town, Withergate? It sounds like bad news.						
Dialogue||You're the most graceful creature in the whole forest.																													
Dialogue||The shortest distance between two people is... a gift!					
Dialogue||To be honest with you XX, I'm really trying not to screw this up with you.																									
Dialogue||This is a nice little town, I think I'll make it a regular stop.									
Dialogue||Hey, XX. Can I grab you for a moment? I need the opinion of someone like you.
Dialogue||I can't believe you actually want my help with something.
Dialogue||What's so surprising about that, huh? You came to Withergate as an outsider, and I'm not so ignorant to believe that you don't have a unique perspective because of that.[]Sometimes unique perspective is what I need, got it?
Dialogue||Darius wishes for Withergate to be entirely self-sufficient, no need for outsiders immigrating into the city.[]But here you are, an outsider making it in Withergate. I can't help but think what we could do to attract more outsiders and all the talent they could bring.
Dialogue||I guess I never considered that.
Dialogue||That makes sense to me.
Dialogue||Don't sweat it. That's the great thing about me: I think of all the things you don't.
Dialogue||See? You're a bright young farmer. You get up to speed quick.
Dialogue||I don't think many people would want to move to Withergate.
Dialogue||Making it easier to get into the city would be a start.
Dialogue||I didn't ask if you thought anyone would move here or not. But if you aren't going to entertain my thoughts, then just forget it, okay?
Dialogue||I know, I know. That's a great point, but "we have to protect our borders", according to the prince.[]It was no small task to get into Withergate from the outside, XX. But maybe that's a good filter. Only the really ambitious sewer rats, like you, can enter the city!
Dialogue||Have you been taking a little extra relaxation time? You're looking really good!
Dialogue||You're looking good too, doctor! 
Dialogue||So how does Sun Haven's doctor relax?
Dialogue||You think so, huh? I've been trying to exercise a bit more lately. Good to know it shows!
Dialogue||The tavern is so warm and cozy, it's the best place to unwind. Ronald and Mari are fun conversationalists too, and if I'm lucky I'll catch Camila there in the evening. I often have good talks with her.
Dialogue||Oh, I was only being polite.
Dialogue||I thought you must be doing something different. Good for you, doc!
Dialogue||I don't know why you would tell me that, XX.
Dialogue||You know XX, I try and make people feel good about themselves when I talk to them. But I don't often get to feel that way myself.[]I guess I'm just trying to say thanks!
Dialogue||Are you close with Camila?
Dialogue||What's your go-to order at the tavern?
Dialogue||I guess you could say so. It's nothing romantic - she's a bit young for me that way. But she's good company on slow nights.
Dialogue||I just like a drink of something to go with a nice big burger... Oh man, now you've got me thinking about food. Did Mari send you? She's a clever one, so I wouldn't put it past her!
Dialogue||One day, I'lll have to visit Sun Haven - just to freak everyone out!																																			
Dialogue||Hello there! Admiring my shine, are we? 
Dialogue||My name's XX, who are you?
Dialogue||My true name was lost long ago. Here, I'm called the Spectral Knight. I quite like the title!
Dialogue||Eh? You say you're an angler? You don't look like any angler I've seen before.						
Dialogue||Do I look worried? It's just because I found an ingot in my pocket and I don't remember what it's for... Solon is going to chew me out over this.
Dialogue||XX, let me ask you something. Does this hat make my ears look big? You know what - forget I asked.
Dialogue||Actually, I can't tell if those are your real ears, or if that's the hat...
Dialogue||Big ears just means better hearing, right? Music must sound amazing!
Dialogue||At least you asked. Too many people just reach up and yank on them. It hurts![]Oh, and I suppose that answers your question. Yes, these are my ears. Please don't pull on them.
Dialogue||Oh, that is true. I absolutely love listening to the piano. Sometimes though, I just need to hear something with energy. That's when I reach for my Gavin Knapp record. They play guitar better than anyone I've ever heard!
Dialogue||I've never met a rabbit Amari before you.
Dialogue||I have to ask - do you have really really good hearing?
Dialogue||I'm happy to be your first! And yes, I have very very good hearing. I know you didn't ask, but I don't need to be a witch to see that you were about to.
Dialogue||Saw that one coming... Yep, I can hear someone whispering from across the town square.
Dialogue||Forget records, I prefer live music.
Dialogue||I never knew you had such great musical taste!
Dialogue||Well sure, live music is always better. You don't have to be a snob about it though.
Dialogue||Actually, I never listened to music that much before I had a conversation with Claude about it. No really, a full conversation![]Anyway, I bumped into him outside the record store and he opened me up to the world of music. Now I go to the record store every week.
Dialogue||I'm not supposed to talk to strangers.
Dialogue||I'm your new neighbor! My name is XX.
Dialogue||Ooh, the farmer? Liam said we were getting a farmer![]I'm Emma. Liam's my big brother!
Dialogue||You've been on my mind ever since our date. XX, I'm really glad we got together.
Dialogue||Does it feel weird dating someone outside of Nel'Vari?
Dialogue||Have you been in a relationship like this before?
Dialogue||Well... yes, it does. I always thought my life would take place entirely inside of Nel'Vari. But I know that exploring new parts of the world can't be a bad thing.
Dialogue||I've been on some dates with a couple Elves in town but it isn't the same. I mean, you're from a whole different part of the world. There's so much we can learn from each other![]XX, I haven't been this excited about anything in a long time.
Dialogue||Are you uncomfortable with it?
Dialogue||Is it at least a little bit exciting?
Dialogue||Sure I am, but it's a good kind of uncomfortable. Like when I'm performing an experiment with unknown results.[]The thought of visiting you in Sun Haven is scary. I've never been that far outside of home. But... it's time for some new experiences! As long as you're with me, I mean.
Dialogue||Oh, yes XX! I don't want to make you think I'm not interested. I'm truly ecstatic that we're together.[]It's just that the thought of visiting you in Sun Haven is scary. I've never been that far outside of home. But... it's time for some new experiences! As long as you're with me, I mean.
Dialogue||We're going to learn so much together, Iris!
Dialogue||Are you sure you're interested in me and not just my background?
Dialogue||This might be weird, but I've never been more attracted to you than right now. Haha!
Dialogue||Hm, that could very well be the dumbest thing I've heard you say. That's good! I was worried that you were a little too perfect.
Dialogue||Working hard, farmer? I suppose you'd have to, huh?
Dialogue||What do you do for work?
Dialogue||You're right, farming is hard work.
Dialogue||I rent a room out to travelers. Business has been down lately, as you can imagine.
Dialogue||Don't I know it. That's why I never bothered with farming.
Dialogue||Why wouldn't your customers just stay at the inn above the tavern? 
Dialogue||That's a smart business model. 
Dialogue||People are happy to pay for a private space. The inn can get pretty raucus on a busy night.
Dialogue||It was Anne's idea. She's a great resource if you're planning a business. She's good company, too!
Dialogue||Afraid of a little hard work?
Dialogue||Good thing, or I wouldn't have a job right now!
Dialogue||A good friend told me to work smart, not hard. That thinking has kept me very comfortable here.
Dialogue||Heh, I guess that's right. I'm glad it worked out for the two of us, then.
Dialogue||I knew you'd be back, XX. Something I can help you with?
Dialogue||You have good taste, right? What's your favorite food?
Dialogue||I was just wondering, have you gone to see Elios?
Dialogue||When I asked what I could do for you, I meant in terms of merchandise, but...[]Are we talking favorite food of all time? Then I have to go with raspberry cheesecake. So creamy and rich! How can anyone say no to that?
Dialogue||I went to see the Sun Dragon on my fourth day in town. It was mostly for publicity though - don't want to snub the local traditions, right?[]Anyway, I'm not Blessed like Lucia. Who needs magic when you've got a steady income?
Dialogue||Good to know.
Dialogue||Do you think I should try it?
Dialogue||I don't like that look on your face. Let me just say that whatever you're up to, it's not going to work and it better involve raspberry cheesecake.
Dialogue||You haven't had it before? XX, that's completely unacceptable! Go to Liam's bakery and grab a piece immediately! ... And bring me a piece too!
Dialogue||Pretending to value a town's tradition is worse than not participating in it at all.
Dialogue||You seem so strategic, no wonder you're such a success.
Dialogue||You're right, how dare I receive the Sun Dragon's blessing and make an honest living for myself! I'm so ashamed...[]... I hope you can tell that I'm being sarcastic.
Dialogue||Ooh, surprise flattery! Be careful XX, you're starting to grow on me.
Dialogue||Nathaniel said he noticed a skip in my step. I guess I'm feeling a bit better these days.									
Dialogue||XX, I had hoped to run into you today. Why? Oh, for no reason in particular!
Dialogue||Lucia, you're giving me a look.
Dialogue||So, can I start calling you cinderhead now that we're officially dating?
Dialogue||Yes indeed I am! I'm just a bit nervous. I've brought you a gift!
Dialogue||You may, but I cannot be held accountable for any burns you may suffer as a result!
Dialogue||What a surprise!
Dialogue||This is a charm to boost your magical abilities. I know you're blessed just as I am, but this charm will bring your power to the next level.[]I made this myself when I was still young and lacked control. I don't use it much because it's more powerful than I need. I believe it could prove useful to you!
Dialogue||Fine, I won't call you cinderhead... in public.
Dialogue||Whatever you say... cinderhead.
Dialogue||Oh, now you're just pushing my buttons!
Dialogue||You're nearing the line between humor and annoyance, XX. 
Dialogue||When I first came here, I didn't think I would stay. It seemed like just another stop on the road.[]Now I've got my own home and practice here, a wonderful partner, and I've even met the Sun Dragon. It feels almost like it did back on the island.
Dialogue||You said it feels like it did on the island? 
Dialogue||Do you still miss the island?
Dialogue||Yeah! Like my life is actually here, you know? I guess some people call that "putting down roots." In any case, the point is that I'm not leaving Sun Haven for a long time.
Dialogue||Sometimes, yes. I had friends there, you know. But it's behind me, and I really only remember it fondly. You don't have to worry about me running back south - this is my home now.
Dialogue||I don't know if I want to stay here.
Dialogue||I feel the same way.
Dialogue||Shoot, really? Here I thought you would want to stay for sure, especially since you have the farm. We'll have to talk about that soon.
Dialogue||I figured you would, especially since you have the farm. Obviously, you're a huge part of my decision to stay... That is obvious, right?
Dialogue||I'm sure your friends think of you, too.
Dialogue||I'm proud of you!
Dialogue||I hope so. I bet they're all happy. I hope so, anyway.[]It's too bad Jun didn't hear me say all that. He would be ecstatic to see my progress, maybe even enough to give me a candy![]I know the candies are for kids, but Jun lets me take one every now and then, heheh.
Dialogue||Heh, thanks! I guess I've made some progress lately.[]It's too bad Jun didn't hear me say all that. He would be ecstatic to see my progress, maybe even enough to give me a candy![]I know the candies are for kids, but Jun lets me take one every now and then, heheh.
Dialogue||So you're staying in Sun Haven with us? I like that.
Dialogue||So you want me to stay?
Dialogue||What do you like most about Sun Haven?
Dialogue||Of course, we're friends! I want all my friends to stay.
Dialogue||I like Liam's friend Lester. He's silly, hehe.
Dialogue||I haven't decided if we're friends yet.
Dialogue||Okay, then I'll stay!
Dialogue||What? No way! You're teasing, right? I don't like teasing.
Dialogue||Yay, yay! I'm telling Liam and Emma that I got you to stay. Now we can all play games forever!
Dialogue||Why is he so silly?
Dialogue||I don't know Lester.
Dialogue||I don't know, he's just silly! He's good at games and playing, too.
Dialogue||You don't? You should be friends! He's a real guard, with a sword and everything.
Dialogue||It's so nice having a farmer in town again! Are you loving it??
Dialogue||Where are you from?
Dialogue||You seem spirited!
Dialogue||I'm from a city farther to the west called Petri. It's in the middle of a steep valley, so you can really only take one road in or out.
Dialogue||I love being a soldier in Sun Haven. I could have ended up anywhere, so I feel lucky to have this assignment.
Dialogue||What was it like living in Petri?
Dialogue||Do you miss it?
Dialogue||It's a much bigger town than Sun Haven and there's a much stronger military presence. Soldiers are highly respected out there.[]It's a little more relaxed here in Sun Haven, but I find it absolutely charming!
Dialogue||Not too much, no. There's a much stronger military presence in Petri. Soldiers are highly respected out there.[]It's a little more relaxed here in Sun Haven, but I find it absolutely charming!
Dialogue||That's a great attitude for a soldier to have.
Dialogue||A soldier's life sounds miserable.
Dialogue||Thanks! I try to follow Nathaniel's lead. He's always in a good mood.
Dialogue||No way! Clearly you're not the soldier type, so you wouldn't understand.
Dialogue||Hey, farmer. I'm having a great cardio day. Here's a cardio tip for you - have a kid!
Dialogue||It's amazing that you stay so positive these days.
Dialogue||In your experience, what's the hardest thing about being a mom?
Dialogue||Do you mean because Sun Haven is hurting a little bit right now?[]You know, I could waste my energy being worried about it if I wanted to, but I don't see any point in that. So I focus on other things, like my job and family.
Dialogue||The hardest thing? Hm, let me think... I guess it's not knowing what kind of trouble goes on while I'm gone during the day.[]Giuseppe is great at being a dad, but not always the best at being an adult.
Dialogue||It's important to focus on what makes you happy.
Dialogue||It sounds like you're ignoring reality.
Dialogue||Exactly. Stressing out about the bad stuff never helped anyone.
Dialogue||Call it what you want, farmer. We all have to get by somehow.
Dialogue||Does that get tiresome?
Dialogue||At least he makes Topi happy, right?
Dialogue||Sure, but it's also why I love him. He reminds me that I'm allowed to have fun, too.
Dialogue||When it comes down to it, that's all that really matters... but it helps that he watches Topi when I take my afternoon nap, too.
Dialogue||I love hearing my name come out of your mouth.																													
Dialogue||Sometimes I think that if I wasn't a witch, I'd have been a farmer like you.																																																																																																																																	
Dialogue||You now? Haven't you bugged me enough?			
Dialogue||"Lynn, the farmer's wife", oh, I still get giddy when I say it!
Dialogue||I married the pretty blacksmith.
Dialogue||Did you ever think you'd marry a farmer?
Dialogue||Farmer and blacksmith really seem to fit together, don't they? That has to settle it, it was fate that we met each other, XX!
Dialogue||I honestly didn't know who I'd marry. I never thought I'd leave home, really. Back in my village, it's customary for the women to choose their husbands and propose marriage.[]I never saw myself feeling confident enough to do something like that, but before you proposed, I secretly chose you![]To myself, anyways. So I guess I sort of adhered to traditon?
Dialogue||I really don't think it was fate.
Dialogue||Whatever it was, it brought you to me.
Dialogue||...Yeah, I guess it's silly to think it was 'fate'. But I'm still glad we met on that train.
Dialogue||And me to you, XX. Oh, now I'm feeling all giddy again...
Dialogue||You "secretly" chose me? You're so adorable.
Dialogue||You should've proposed to me!
Dialogue||Hey, you ended up proposing, didn't you? Good thing too, because I'm not sure I would have made a mess of it if I tried to!
Dialogue||My back's been aching the last couple of days. Makes bending down a real pain!
Dialogue||Have you been to the hospital for it yet?
Dialogue||You should take it a little easier on yourself.
Dialogue||Eh, I didn't really want to trouble anyone... I think it's fine, really. It's just a little crick in the back, you know?
Dialogue||Yeah, you're right, XX. I should, but I've gotten so many orders lately. People in Sun Haven really depend on me, so I have a real hard time telling anyone "no".
Dialogue||Go see a doctor, Liam.
Dialogue||Doctors like Wornhardt are here to help, you should get checked out.
Dialogue||I just don't want to be a bother is all... oh, alright, XX. I'll go make an appointment...
Dialogue||It's okay if you can't always help everyone.
Dialogue||You have to learn to turn people down.
Dialogue||I know, XX. I just have a really hard time feeling like I'm letting someone down, especially when they need me for something.[]This is a problem I'm really trying to work on, so thanks for being supportive.
Dialogue||Something like that is just too hard for me. Look, can we forget I said anything, please? I'll just put up with the extra work. It's fine, really.
Dialogue||Good day, adventurer. Find yourself wanting for protection? One look in my cart can solve that.
Dialogue||Can I ask you about your eye?
Dialogue||Do you ever sell your weapons to the army?
Dialogue||Go on kid, just ask your question.
Dialogue||The army? My weaponry would be wasted on their training dummies. The blades would dull long before they saw combat.[]My goods should be used by real fighters, not pansies running routines.
Dialogue||How did you lose it?
Dialogue||Actually, I feel like I'm being rude now...
Dialogue||When I was younger than you are now, I went looking in a crystal ball to see my future.[]Well, the ball turned out to be cursed. Held me captive and glowed so bright that it burned blindness into my eye. So, there you go.[]I can tell you more about it another time. I've got lots to tell, you know. If you have a spot of free time, why don't you come by for a tale?
Dialogue||I figured you wouldn't have the guts to ask. I'm having a good day, so I'll tell you anyway.[]When I was younger than you are now, I went looking in a crystal ball to see my future.[]Well, the ball turned out to be cursed, flashed so bright that it burned blindness into my eye.[]I can tell you more about it another time. I've got lots to tell, you know. If you have a spot of free time, why don't you come by for a tale?
Dialogue||You're right, soldiers really don't know what they're doing.
Dialogue||Soldiers are real fighters.
Dialogue||Truer words have never been spoken.
Dialogue||Soldiers fight because they're told to. A warrior fights because the fight is in their blood. Not that you'd know anything about that.
Dialogue||I like the ring you gave me, but it could use a couple of spikes.																											
Dialogue||So Withergate's wannabe citizen returns to pester the prince. Don't you know how busy I am?
Dialogue||Hopefully you have time to relax in your daily work as prince.
Dialogue||The responsibilities of a prince must be a burden.
Dialogue||Unsurprisingly, you continue to show your ignorance. I work when I want and take what free time I please, as a prince should.
Dialogue||I consider them a privilege. That's the differences between us - we're simply cut from a different cloth.
Dialogue||I can only imagine what the prince does with his free time.
Dialogue||I envy you, my prince.
Dialogue||What I enjoy more than anything is observing my citizens. Sometimes I walk through my streets and give my goodwill to the loyalists. It's important to maintain my presence as prince.
Dialogue||We aren't so different.
Dialogue||I long to understand the world you live in.
Dialogue||Brash fool... The dirt on my heels has seen greater luxury than you will in your entire life.
Dialogue||Perhaps you will get a taste of my world one day. If you work hard and earn your place at my table.
Dialogue||Lately, I've been inspired to learn all sorts of new things!
Dialogue||What are you learning about now?
Dialogue||How do you find time to learn so much stuff?
Dialogue||Anne had a set of these curious cards. She told me that witches in the Western Region are crazy about them right now. They're called "tarot cards."[]I can learn to divine fate with them, similar to my tea leaves.
Dialogue||If I really want to do something, I let nothing stop me. It's important for me to make room in my life for new passions, you know.
Dialogue||Do you really need to learn more magic?
Dialogue||You're so curious, I love it.
Dialogue||Do I <i>need</i> to? Maybe I don't, but that doesn't mean I don't want to. I thought you'd be excited to hear what I was up to, but I guess not. 
Dialogue||Pretty soon I'll learn all the cards, and then I'll divine our future with them! It'll be so much fun. 
Dialogue||But you're so busy, how do you do it?
Dialogue||You sound even busier than I am.
Dialogue||Hey, I'm a pretty quick learner! And if I get my work done a few minutes faster every day, then it really adds up.
Dialogue||I want to live every day to the fullest. If there's time to spare, I want to spend it either learning something new, or with you! 
Dialogue||XX, my sweet. You're radiant as ever in tonight's darkness.
Dialogue||I never knew you to be so sweet!
Dialogue||It's time I asked... is there a story behind your sword?
Dialogue||I put on a strong front for the people, as a prince must. But you're not "people" XX. I want to be authentic with you.
Dialogue||This sword... Yes indeed, but I don't know how you'll feel about it.[]When Demons reach the end of their life, their bodies become as stone. The stone is different for each Demon, but stronger demons make harder stone.[]When my grandfather passed, his last wish was to continue serving his people. Then he became a hard, shining red stone almost like glass.[]We forged my grandfather into this sword to honor his last wish. He is always with me, as my protector.
Dialogue||I like this authentic version of you.
Dialogue||What if everyone in Withergate saw you like this?
Dialogue||Of course you do! But don't go and spread rumors about me. I need to maintain my public presence, after all.
Dialogue||Don't go and spread rumors about me. I need to maintain my public presence, after all.[]Besides, nobody would believe you anyway. And if they did, I would lock them up.
Dialogue||Wasn't there a less creepy way to honor him?
Dialogue||That's a beautiful way to honor him.
Dialogue||If you think that's creepy, then don't bother asking what we did with Grandmother.
Dialogue||I think so, too. In fact, I want the same thing for myself one day. One day in the far, far future of course.
Dialogue||This city isn't a bad place to spend eternity!									 					
Dialogue||Sun Haven is such a pleasant little town. It's unbelievable that some people are scared to travel here.
Dialogue||Are you worried about the rumors?
Dialogue||How long do you think you'll stay here, Wornhardt?
Dialogue||Ah yes, Withergate, land of monsters, city of the underbelly... I don't know about any of that, but the idea of a monster attack is worrying even if it's unlikely.
Dialogue||I haven't thought about it too much, but as long as I'm happy then I don't see any reason to leave. 
Dialogue||It's a good thing we have you in town, just in case.
Dialogue||I don't think it will come to that.
Dialogue||Right, it's a good thing... But I hope it doesn't come to that. I moved to Sun Haven to avoid that kind of action.
Dialogue||Neither do I, but there is this little voice in the back of my head that keeps reminding me of things like that, things that worry me. I've been trying to ignore that voice for a long time.
Dialogue||It's important to let yourself be happy.
Dialogue||So you'll just abandon Sun Haven as soon as you're unhappy with it?
Dialogue||I agree. We should enjoy the happy little things while they're here with us.[]I like chatting with you, XX. For some reason, the conversation just flows.
Dialogue||That's not what I said, XX. There's no need to get worked up. Why don't you take a few breaths and relax?
Dialogue||Isn't your name XX? So good to meet you, I'm Catherine. I own the farming store here.
Dialogue||That's right - wait, how did you know my name?
Dialogue||Oh, don't you know? I'm surprised you can't tell. I'm a witch! It wasn't hard to divine the name of our new farmer.
Dialogue||A friend like you is great to have, XX. Not many other people really understand me.																																										 																																																										
Dialogue||In my whole life here, I've never seen the town so very very quiet as this last year.
Dialogue||Are you worried about the rumors going around?
Dialogue||What was it like growing up here?
Dialogue||You're talking about Withergate, nya? A city of monsters sounds bad! But maybe they're nice monsters? I think it's scary not to know!
Dialogue||Sun Haven has always been fun for me to explore, nya. There's lots of trees to climb, you know. Perfect for a growing kitty, nya nya![]One time I got stuck and Nathaniel had to come save me, teehee!
Dialogue||You don't need to be scared of rumors.
Dialogue||I'll protect you, Kitty!
Dialogue||Maybe... but I can't help but be on guard.
Dialogue||Nya!! Thank you, XX! You're such a brave friend!
Dialogue||Sun Haven wouldn't be the same without you, Kitty.
Dialogue||It sounds like you've been causing trouble your whole life.
Dialogue||Ah!! You're too nice, nya! You make Sun Haven even better than it was before, too.
Dialogue||Trouble? Kitty? Nyaaan...
Dialogue||I've been learning how to read palms. It's a little tricky, but also very fun!
Dialogue||I didn't know a palm could be read.
Dialogue||Why learn to read palms?
Dialogue||Well, you don't read them like you read a book. It's more about tracing both the physical shape of your palm and the aura that flows through it.[]It's said that a hand can tell you a lot about a person, after all. Their past and their future.
Dialogue||It interests me, is all. Besides, it may be useful someday to someone. Helping someone out in the future is a good a reason as any, I think.
Dialogue||Do you worry about the future often?
Dialogue||Do you think about the past often?
Dialogue||I don't think there's any good in worrying about the future too much, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't think about it.[]I want to use the time I have in the present to make sure everyone I care about is comfortable in the years to come. Maybe palms can help me!
Dialogue||I don't think it's helpful to dwell on the past very much, but who we were in the past is still really important. I wouldn't be the same person if it wasn't for the past I had.[]I'm sure most people feel the same. So it's good to rediscover your past once in a while.
Dialogue||That sounds pointless.
Dialogue||The world needs more people who think like you!
Dialogue||Maybe it sounds "pointless" to you, but it's invigorating for me. Everyone is different. You know that, right? 
Dialogue||Hehe. It does, but then I wouldn't be so unique! I'm just kidding, it would be great if more people felt the same. 
Dialogue||Hi, stranger![]Are you a farmer? Magic Red Lady visited yesterday and said a farmer was coming.
Dialogue||That's right, I'm a farmer. My name is XX, what's yours?
Dialogue||My name is XX... Hehe, no it's not - I'm Pod!
Dialogue||When're you going to bring in some of those fresh farm goods so Ronald can whip up something fancy?
Dialogue||At this point, there's not much about me you don't know. It's a funny thing, getting to know so much about a person.
Dialogue||I can find something new about you - what's the most exciting thing you've done?
Dialogue||What's so funny about getting to know someone, anyway?
Dialogue||Heh, you're good at this relationship business![]Okay, there was one time when I won a talent show in the Eastern Region. I don't normally go for stuff like that, but there was a cash prize and I happen to have the voice of a siren.[]What, can't you imagine me on stage?
Dialogue||Not funny like a joke or Nathaniel's face or anything. I guess I'm saying it's... unfamiliar. In a good way. A fun way.
Dialogue||I can see it - you're already a complete showstopper!
Dialogue||You don't strike me as much of a performer.
Dialogue||You've got that right! Maybe one day I'll find a stage to sing on again.
Dialogue||For your information, I got a standing ovation when I was done singing.
Dialogue||I'm surprised, you're usually so confident.
Dialogue||It will feel familiar soon.
Dialogue||Make no mistake, I'll always be sure of myself. It's how I grew up, remember?[]But even I can admit when I'm in uncharted waters. That's what our relationship feels like to me - an unpredictable adventure.
Dialogue||Even I can admit when I'm in uncharted waters, XX. That's what our relationship feels like to me - an unpredictable adventure.
Dialogue||Don't just stand there gawking. Either you're buying or you're leaving.						
Dialogue||I know that one day I'll be leading the corps. For now, I just need to bide my time.																																																								
Dialogue||I love my ears, but I wish I had whiskers too. What, you don't?																						
Dialogue||Sitting on the royal council is mostly just dealing with citizens. And mostly, it's dumb citizens.																							
Dialogue||Not that it's a real surprise, but people are always buying all the prettiest plants I sell. But really, some of the most useful plants are often the least pretty.
Dialogue||Plants can be complicated, right?
Dialogue||You must be good at seeing value in everything.
Dialogue||True. It might be a very complicated subject, but I think it's still a very fascinating one. Some plants and herbs are useful for witchcraft, some are useful for everyday things.[]Most are useful for both, in different ways. 
Dialogue||It's not that I expect everyone to know as much about plants as I do, it's just sort of sad.[]Stinkwort is perfect for getting stains out of anything, but it smells funky and looks dull, so no one ever buys any.[]I think there's value to everything, you just have to know where to look.
Dialogue||I will never doubt your knowledge of all things green.
Dialogue||How did you learn so much about plants?
Dialogue||I don't know if you're poking fun of me, but I agree! Never doubt me, hehe. 
Dialogue||Well, what began as a childish hobby ended up blossoming into a much more serious interest. I've learned from experience and reading botany texts. Lots of both.[]Oh, and the "blossoming" pun was intended!
Dialogue||If it isn't selling, then maybe you should get rid of it.
Dialogue||Maybe you could teach people about the uses of different plants?
Dialogue||If I didn't even offer it, then that would just make the problem worse. Then no one would <i>ever</i> know what value Stinkwort has.[]I get where you're coming from on a business side of things, but that just isn't me.
Dialogue||"That's actually a really great idea, XX. I'm a little too busy for that, but I know Emmett always has time.[]He's not as well versed as me, but he could swing it! I'll have to talk about adding it into his schedule.
Dialogue||XX! For a moment I forgot I was awake. Sometimes I see you in my dreams.
Dialogue||You've dreamed about me?
Dialogue||Don't read into this, but what would be a good gift if I wanted to surprise you?
Dialogue||Sometimes... actually, quite often. I hope that doesn't make you uncomfortable. They're just silly dreams, anyway.
Dialogue||Oh, XX, don't tease me. I'd love to just spend time with you. I don't need any fancy gifts.
Dialogue||I think it's flattering.
Dialogue||It is a bit weird...
Dialogue||Oh thank goodness - I was worried you'd think I was being a creep!
Dialogue||I was worried you would feel that way. I'm sorry XX, but I can't control what happens in my dreams.
Dialogue||Aw, come on! 
Dialogue||Oh well, at least I tried.
Dialogue||All right, let me think... I suppose I have been looking for a new decoration to go in my home. I would love a new houseplant!
Dialogue||You're so full of surprises, XX. I think I know every little detail about you and then you come back with another surprise.
Dialogue||Ah, XX. It is good to have you in my company. 									
Dialogue||Hey XX. It's another beautiful, slow day. I could get used to days like these.[]Hey, do you think Xyla would arm wrestle with me?
Dialogue||I don't think that arm wrestling match would end well...
Dialogue||Can we be serious for a sec? Are you happy in our relationship?
Dialogue||Yeah, you're totally right![]Wait do you mean for me, or for her? Whose side are you on, anyway? 
Dialogue||Huh? Happy? Yeah, sure. I mean, I'm plenty happy with you.[]XX, what's this all about? 
Dialogue||Xyla is really scary.
Dialogue||I believe in you, even if you'll obviously lose.
Dialogue||That's... a good point. And exactly why I need to beat her at arm wrestling! 
Dialogue||Now THAT'S the kind of support I love to hear from you, XX. 
Dialogue||I'm having doubts.
Dialogue||I'm just trying to plan for our future.
Dialogue||Doubts? Well don't string me along, XX. If you're going to leave, just do it. I don't like games like this.
Dialogue||Our future? Oh... Oh! I see what's going on here. You've got a special question to ask me, huh?[]I won't pressure you - take your time! Just know that whenever you're ready to ask, I'm ready to answer. 
Dialogue||Hey citizen, you're a farmer right? Your life must be so different from mine!									 					
Dialogue||Withergate's future is steeped in glory, and we shall sit at the top!																																																						 									
Dialogue||Nobody knows the forests around here like I do.															
Dialogue||Hey there, XX. You must do a bit of cooking, right? I always wondered, what do you think of my bread oven? Caroline is the real star of the bakery!
Dialogue||Your bread oven has a name?
Dialogue||How many loaves of bread do you bake in a single day?
Dialogue||[]I don't know why the oven has a name, but when I bought the bakery way back when, I found the name "Caroline" etched into the brickwork on the inside of the oven.[]I've just referred to the oven that way ever since. You don't think that's silly, do you?
Dialogue||For a long while it seemed like I didn't need to do much more than a dozen loaves a day. But now I'm selling thrice that, at least![]Honestly it's real tough to keep up with the demand sometimes.
Dialogue||That's a very charming story.
Dialogue||It's a little strange to give your bread oven a name.
Dialogue||That's a relief! I was worried you were going to think I was weird or something... I'm glad you liked the story.
Dialogue||Oh... you were actually the first person I had told this to, besides Emma and Elizabeth. Maybe I should stop calling my oven by name...
Dialogue||At least you make plenty enough for your sisters.
Dialogue||It must be a sign of Sun Haven turning around.
Dialogue||Those two are why I get out of bed every morning, I don't know if I could handle all this work if not for them.[]Oh, I'm sorry, XX. I'm not trying to dump all of my complaints on you. We should talk about something else...
Dialogue||I think so, too. I'm glad the town is turning around, but the extra orders have gotten really exhausting.[]Oh, I'm sorry, XX. I'm not trying to dump all of my complaints on you. We should talk about something else...
Dialogue||Ooh, that's a nice look! But don't you think you could update it?						
Dialogue||Hey hun, how's your work been?
Dialogue||I've been keeping myself busy. How about you? 
Dialogue||What kind of energies do you read in our marriage?
Dialogue||I was a little worried that married life would cut into my work.[]But honestly, nothing's really changed. I never thought marriage would be so... comfortable. I love it! 
Dialogue||Oh, it's difficult to explain. But when it comes to how I interpret auras and energy, it takes time to get a clear reading.[]But that's okay. You and I can take all the time in the world.
Dialogue||You're married, but you still have a life of your own.
Dialogue||You should focus on our relationship more.
Dialogue||Oh believe me, I know that! But you're so compatible with me XX, I can't believe how lucky I am. We truly were made for each other, weren't we? 
Dialogue||I... truly hope that isn't how you feel, XX. I need our relationship to be liberating, not confining. 
Dialogue||I'd be happy to wait with you forever, if that's what it takes.
Dialogue||Well I'm reading energies right now that say you're super cute!
Dialogue||Hehe, of course you'd say something sappy like that! 
Dialogue||Well if it isn't one of my favorite people in Sun Haven![]Actually, I say that for a lot of customers. But for you it's kind of true!
Dialogue||Wait, it looks like you're hiding something...
Dialogue||When are you off work? I was thinking I could see you after.
Dialogue||Aw, you caught me! All right XX, listen up.[]The first time I ever had enough money to buy myself something nice - just for fun, not like food or shelter - I bought myself pearl earrings.[]This is one of the two earrings. I'm keeping the other, but I want you to have this one. You're becoming a good friend and I guess I want to show you that it means something to me.[]But you better not lose this! Just stick it in your pocket or something, as long as it's safe.
Dialogue||Oh, is that what you were thinking? Well I'm always open for business, but I close my cart around 4.
Dialogue||Are you sure? It sounds important.
Dialogue||I'd be happy to keep it for you.
Dialogue||Keep it safe like I said, okay? It's lucky, you know!
Dialogue||Let's call it a date!
Dialogue||Actually, forget about it.
Dialogue||Oh, how unusually forward of you... I could get used to that![]Sure, let's give it a shot. Why not! Come by my cart tomorrow at 4:00 pm.
Dialogue||Oh? If you say so, XX.
Dialogue||Oh hi there, XX. I hope your day is going well.[]Me? My arms are sore today.
Dialogue||Don't you get tired of working so hard? 
Dialogue||What made you want to be a blacksmith?
Dialogue||Sure I do. I try not to complain though. It's like Solon says, "Every breath goes into the forge."[]At least I'm learning a lot. In the end, I just want my family to be proud of me.
Dialogue||In the Eastern Region, women are the blacksmiths. My mother and grandmother supported our whole family with smithing, so I guess you could say it's in my blood.
Dialogue||Your work should be for yourself, not for other people.
Dialogue||You'll make your family proud, I know it.
Dialogue||In my village, the only people that think that way don't have any friends or family.
Dialogue||Aw, thank you XX. I'll have to make you some fantastic armor one day! 
Dialogue||Tradition is nice, but how do you know if this is what you really want?
Dialogue||Tradition is important. It's good that you're representing your culture.
Dialogue||When I'm forging steel, I feel connected to something bigger than myself. It's too bad you don't share that feeling or else I'm sure you'd understand.
Dialogue||When I'm forging steel, I feel connected to something bigger than myself. I'm glad you understand that kind of connection, too.
Dialogue||I'm the only Elf in Nel'Vari to venture out so often. I just can't stay put when the wind is blowing.																																																																
Dialogue||Take a stroll through my wheat field sometime, it's really peaceful. Just don't trample the wheat, please.
Dialogue||Nice day today. Are you going into the forest? You should be prepared.
Dialogue||Where do you get your weapons?
Dialogue||Have you ever been caught unprepared before?
Dialogue||I'm a traveling merchant, so I know how to spot quality. Whenever I see some good iron on the road, I barter for it. That's real trade, kid.
Dialogue||I've been in an ambush once before, but I've always got something sharp on me. Really, those bandits caught themselves unprepared!
Dialogue||What if you get scammed?
Dialogue||How long have you been doing this?
Dialogue||Sure, that's happened once or twice. What happens is I learn from it and try not to let it happen again.[]And if I happen to find the person who scammed me, then I'll give them a conversation they won't likely forget.
Dialogue||I can't say exactly, but I can tell you that my hair was black when I started!
Dialogue||Your job sounds dangerous.
Dialogue||It sounds like you can really handle yourself. 
Dialogue||Might be, yeah. That's why it's not for whiners to do. You might stick with farming, kid.
Dialogue||I spend all day around these weapons, don't you think I play with them a bit? 
Dialogue||I just met a couple of travelers from the Northern Region. The north sounds so cold... I'm really glad it's warm here!
Dialogue||Are you from Sun Haven, or did you move here?
Dialogue||Have you traveled much outside of Sun Haven?
Dialogue||All of my siblings and I were born right here in Sun Haven. All eight of us![]The rest of my litter moved to other cities, but I just couldn't leave.
Dialogue||Not really. I went on vacation with my family once to the far west. It was very industrious and everyone seemed so busy. Honestly, I didn't love it.
Dialogue||What's keeping you here?
Dialogue||You love Sun Haven that much?
Dialogue||Hm... You know, I just see a future for myself here. And I don't mean literally, like in a crystal ball - I prefer tea leaves for fortune telling, anyway.[]Oops, I'm rambling. To put it simply, I want to raise a family here. Simple as that!
Dialogue||Don't sound so surprised! I'm sure you'll agree once you get to know everyone. The people really make this town special.
Dialogue||If you thought the big city was boring, that's on you.
Dialogue||I don't see why anyone would want to live that way.
Dialogue||XX, life is only as boring as you make it. Or, right now, life is as annoying as you make it.[]I'm saying that you're annoying me.
Dialogue||I completely agree! A busy town is fun, but at least give me some trees to sit under on a hot day.
Dialogue||Runnin' the books for the apartments is a nice gig, but it's sure boring.			
Dialogue||Can you see yourself in my armor? I was polishing it all night!																																																																				
Dialogue||Hi XX. Today I saw a flower bud that made me think of you. It just started to bloom!
Dialogue||Is that because I'm... pretty like a flower?
Dialogue||You're so charming. I've never met anyone like you before, Iris.
Dialogue||Maybe! Or maybe it's because you're soft and gentle. With me, at least. Also, you smell surprisingly nice!
Dialogue||Like me, huh? Well I can't <i>not</i> dig into that a little bit. Please, explain!
Dialogue||I'm not soft - I'm tough.
Dialogue||I'm liking this flower bud image more and more.
Dialogue||All right, relax. You're not fooling anyone with the tough act.
Dialogue||Haha, you're such a dork. I mean it about the smell, though. You should smell like mud and sweat, but you just smell... really good! 
Dialogue||You're brilliant and intensely focused.
Dialogue||You're gorgeous and totally independent.
Dialogue||Heh, thanks XX![]We're already dating, but it feels like you're getting ready to ask me out again... What are you planning?
Dialogue||When I'm older, I'm going to lead the army just like Nathaniel!																																																																																																																														
Dialogue||Hey, um... Have you seen a copper helmet anywhere? I put mine down... somewhere...
Dialogue||Don't you get in trouble when you lose your gear?
Dialogue||Pinto, do you even like it in the army?
Dialogue||You don't know the half of it. Has Roza ever yelled at you before? I can feel her voice in my bones when she yells.
Dialogue||Even though I'm still terrible at it, I'm having a lot of fun. When we're relieved of duty for the day, we all get to just hang around the barracks. I've never had a group of friends to do that with before.[]So yeah, I love it!
Dialogue||I'll find your helmet for you!  
Dialogue||I hope you find it soon.
Dialogue||You will? Wow, okay! I think I was walking nearby town square when I lost it. Thanks, farmer!
Dialogue||That makes two of us. How many chances do you get before they kick you out of the army?
Dialogue||Your training will catch on, one day!
Dialogue||There are easier ways to make friends.
Dialogue||That's what I keep telling myself - but it's nice to hear it from someone else for once!
Dialogue||Maybe for you. Making friends has always been hard for me, even harder than this military stuff.
Dialogue||Hi hi, XX! Do you have a busy day? Don't let it get you down!
Dialogue||How do you stay so happy all the time?
Dialogue||I'm never sad with you around, Kitty!
Dialogue||Just look around XX, the whole world is happy, nya! Just look at the sunshine and flowers. They're so bright and joyful, I just copy them!
Dialogue||Aw! Same same, XX! Since we became two peas in a pod, everything has been happier. I'm very very grateful to have you with me!
Dialogue||That doesn't make any sense.
Dialogue||Does that make you a... copycat?
Dialogue||I don't know how else to explain to you, XX. That's all there is to it! If you don't understand, then Kitty can't help.
Dialogue||Heehee, XX! I can't believe I never thought of that - I'm a real copycat. How funny, nya nya!
Dialogue||I'm glad you're happier now, Kitty!
Dialogue||You make me happier, too!
Dialogue||I promise to always be happy with you, XX. And Kitty doesn't break promises!
Dialogue||I promise to always be happy with you, XX. And Kitty doesn't break promises! 
Dialogue||You are welcome in Withergate, but that can change if you ever think of crossing us.																																																																																										 									
Dialogue||Hey there, XX! Buying anything today, or just looking for a chat?
Dialogue||You're always out for a sale, huh? How did you get started as a merchant?
Dialogue||Do you plan to stay in Sun Haven long?
Dialogue||Let's just say I've been supporting myself for a long time. I learned the ins and outs of trade to survive from a young age.[]I'm living proof that survival is for the fittest!
Dialogue||If business doesn't pick up someday soon, I might have to move on. Sun Haven has been good to me though. I'm really pulling for this town.
Dialogue||That sounds hard on your own. Don't be afraid to lean on others for help.
Dialogue||That's actually inspiring, you're a real-life success story.
Dialogue||I didn't ask for your opinion, so keep your thoughts to yourself.
Dialogue||I know I am, but it's nice to hear it out loud![]Hold on, don't go thinking that compliments will get you a discount. They won't.
Dialogue||If I didn't know better, I'd say you like this town for more than its profitability.
Dialogue||I hope you're able to stick around.
Dialogue||Don't get me wrong, profit is my North Star. But, okay, there's part of me that likes Sun Haven for what it is.[]Or maybe making friends is part of my marketing strategy - who knows!
Dialogue||Me too, XX. Packing everything up and moving is such a hassle for me, not to mention expensive.[]No matter how well I secure the cart, something always comes loose and makes a huge mess...
Dialogue||You reek of inferiority.
Dialogue||Feeling well today? It looks like you got good sleep last night.
Dialogue||I dreamed I was flying with dragon's wings. Did you dream?
Dialogue||You always notice me, Jun. I'm lucky to have someone as mindful as you.
Dialogue||Dragon wings? Mine definitely wasn't as adventurous as yours.[]In my dream I was a cloud in the sky watching all the people in town below. I could even see into their homes, like dollhouses. It was strange, but also quite unique.
Dialogue||XX, I noticed you right away. How could I not? I feel like the lucky one here!
Dialogue||Yeah, that's not quite so adventurous.
Dialogue||That sounds kind of fun!
Dialogue||Maybe next time I'll join you in the sky with dragon's wings. One can only hope!
Dialogue||You think so? Part of me thinks so too. It's too bad we aren't clouds in the sky, XX.
Dialogue||Strange, I didn't really notice you until we started talking.
Dialogue||I noticed you on my first day here, too.
Dialogue||Oh, huh. Not even once? That's a little disappointing...
Dialogue||Is that true? So we were sneaking glances at each other from the very beginning? That's too cute!
Dialogue||Do you know I almost learned to farm, too? I read about it in a book!
Dialogue||Can you tell me what crops I should plant, Kitty?
Dialogue||What kind of books do you like to read?
Dialogue||Ooh, my choice? I wish fish grew on trees but hm... Ooh or you should plant lettuce for Kitty!
Dialogue||Fairy Tales! My favorite one is about a cat who turns into a human princess. I'm sure you can guess why, teehee!
Dialogue||Lettuce it is!
Dialogue||I don't think lettuce is a good idea.
Dialogue||Yay! I know the general store has lettuce seeds, nya. Bring me some when it's grown!
Dialogue||No no? Well you would know, XX, since you're the real farmer.
Dialogue||Aren't fairytales meant for children?
Dialogue||That does sound like you, Kitty!
Dialogue||Fairytales are for everyone, nyan. Don't you like to use your imagination?
Dialogue||Aw, you think Kitty's a princess?? Thank you, XX!
Dialogue||I don't remember my dream last night, but I woke up feeling entirely at peace. I wonder what was going on in my head!
Dialogue||Don't you usually wake up feeling that way?
Dialogue||I bet I know what you were dreaming about.
Dialogue||People are often surprised to learn this, but I'm actually a rather restless sleeper. It's why a quiet morning routine is important to start my day.
Dialogue||Oh, stop you. I already know what you're going to say - you!
Dialogue||I appreciate quiet in the morning too.
Dialogue||I like to get straight to work when I wake up.
Dialogue||That makes sense. We're kindred spirits, you and I.
Dialogue||Ah, that makes sense. Farming is busy work, after all. But I'm afraid I wouldn't be mentally prepared for the day if I went straight to work.
Dialogue||Actually, I was going to say the sunset over the farm. 
Dialogue||Of course it was me!
Dialogue||Oh! That's a good guess, actually. It almost feels right, too.[]Oh well, I guess I'll never know. But now I'm in the mood to watch tonight's sunset!
Dialogue||You know XX, I do have other interests outside of you. However... you're probably right.
Dialogue||You've demonstrated that even someone of the lowest class can learn respect. You may ask questions of me freely from now on, outsider. But don't get cocky.
Dialogue||Who in town do you trust the most?
Dialogue||I've got to know... What does the prince like to eat for dessert?
Dialogue||Certainly, it's Xyla. I've worked with her closely over years. What's more, I'm the reason she lives here in the first place.[]Having found her at a low point and raising her into glory... I know her loyalty is never in question.
Dialogue||Since I was little, our chef has made me an excellent moon cream pie. I'm sure you wouldn't stand it. It is an acquired taste.
Dialogue||One day, I'll earn your trust the same way.
Dialogue||What if she's just keeping up an act?
Dialogue||If I will it, certainly. But only if I will it.
Dialogue||If you think she could fool ME... the only fool here is you.
Dialogue||It sounds great!
Dialogue||It sounds weird.
Dialogue||Some of the street vendors in Withergate serve a lesser version of it, but nobody makes it like the royal family's chef.
Dialogue||I wouldn't expect an unrefined pallet to enjoy it.
Dialogue||Look at you, a successful farmer, and Blessed too! You've come a long way since you stepped off that train.																																									
Dialogue||When I have a goal, I take aim and always hit my target.											
Dialogue||Whoa, hey! I wasn't expecting you just now.																		
Dialogue||I didn't expect to find someone like you, XX.																																																																													
Dialogue||If anyone asks, you're a gladiator instead of a farmer. Got it? It's less embarrassing for me.																					
Dialogue||I'm really curious to see how your farm turns out. That old land has needed a caretaker for years now.			
Dialogue||Once I saw a lady dive into the ocean and disappear and I think she had a fish tail. No, really!																																																																																																																																																																																								
Dialogue||Did Nathaniel say anything about a surprise fitness test?																	
Dialogue||XX, great to see you again![]If you have the time, I'd love to check in with you. I am the town's counselor, after all.
Dialogue||Sure, let's check in!
Dialogue||What do you do as a counselor?
Dialogue||How are you settling in, XX? 
Dialogue||Simply put, I talk to people about their problems. If you're feeling overwhelmed, come find me. Everybody needs someone to talk to.
Dialogue||I've been settling in well.
Dialogue||Sometimes I get lost around here.
Dialogue||That's really good to hear, XX. You already look much more comfortable than when you first showed up.
Dialogue||I would love to help, but... I'm terrible at giving directions.
Dialogue||People need to learn to deal with their own problems.
Dialogue||This town is lucky to have someone like you in it.
Dialogue||I'm surprised to hear you say something like that.
Dialogue||Thanks, XX. I knew you were a kind person.
Dialogue||Hey, farmer. Stay safe, yeah?																																													
Dialogue||XX, have you considered a change of profession? You are too fine a person to be digging in dirt.
Dialogue||You never told me, what kind of work do you do with your father?
Dialogue||If you weren't royalty, what job do you think you would have?
Dialogue||Look, I'm going to tell you something that you have to keep quiet. If I learn that you've spoken of this to anyone, you can consider yourself exiled from Withergate.[]... My father does very little work. He once worked tirelessly, but now that Withergate is finished, he sits back and lets me handle everything. He calls it training. I find it infuriating.
Dialogue||Hm... That's something I've never pondered. Who knows? You're a farmer, and one with class. Perhaps I could have been like you.
Dialogue||You can trust me to keep this quiet.
Dialogue||That doesn't seem fair at all.
Dialogue||I know, XX, or else I wouldn't have spoken about it in the first place.
Dialogue||Fairness doesn't matter. He is both my father and my king. While he holds the throne, I have to respect him as both.
Dialogue||A farmer? I don't see it.
Dialogue||You would have done well for yourself!
Dialogue||Oh, you think yourself so competent? I'm certain I can till land and raise crops just as well as any farmer - better, even!
Dialogue||Then again, a farmer's life rather lacks dignity. Perhaps a merchant, instead. Surely, I would have become a wealthy owner of several successful shops.
Dialogue||My dearest XX! I was just thinking about you, and about our future.
Dialogue||Our future? What were you thinking?
Dialogue||What goals do you want to accomplish in the future?
Dialogue||I'm not sure! There are so many possibilities, XX. I'm just glad we're finally together. Suddenly the future is a bright, branching river - and we get to choose where we go.
Dialogue||Since I've learned all I can about wind magic from Nivara, I would love to find a new source of instruction. I know there's more knowledge out there, I just don't know where.
Dialogue||The future is completely in our control.
Dialogue||I don't think we get to choose our futures.
Dialogue||I feel exactly the same way. XX, I'm constantly amazed at you. I always knew we were a perfect match.
Dialogue||Every part of me disagrees, XX. But that's okay, you'll see when the time comes.
Dialogue||Be patient, I'm sure you'll something will come to you.
Dialogue||Keep looking. You won't find it if you don't look.
Dialogue||You're right. I just need to keep myself open to all possibilities.
Dialogue||Is someone there? I can barely see out of this thing...						
Dialogue||It's good you're here. It has been a day of boredom in the castle.
Dialogue||What's it like living in the castle?
Dialogue||Have you ever tried living in sunlight?
Dialogue||Withergate Castle is the safest place in the world. It is comfortable and luxurious, certainly, but there was a time when it was the difference between life or death for demons.
Dialogue||XX... I've gathered a small fondness for you, but a question like that is an insult.[]Demons were forced to live in sunlight for ages. Ages of blindness and anguish. Only in this eternal night have we found peace.
Dialogue||How long ago was it built?
Dialogue||I'm glad you had the castle. Otherwise, Withergate may not have been made.
Dialogue||My grandfather pulled the castle from the ground with his magic one hundred years ago, with the help of my father and me. I pride myself on having been there that day. When I look at the castle, I still feel that pride.
Dialogue||I didn't realize you were so sensitive, Darius.
Dialogue||I should have known better.
Dialogue||You're getting too comfortable with me., XX. If you don't correct yourself, I will be forced to make the correction.
Dialogue||Little XX... You're quick to regain my good graces. I seem to be developing a soft spot for you.
Dialogue||Submit to your prince.
Dialogue||Are my clothes dirty, XX? I just came back from the beach. It's fun digging in the sand!																	 																																																																																																													
Dialogue||When no one's looking, I hide snacks in my pants. But not in the pockets, 'cause that's what they expect.												
Dialogue||Love you, sweetie!																																			
Dialogue||The tavern has some good food, but it never tastes quite as fresh as I'd like.[]Oh, don't mention that to Mari!																																																																																																																			
Dialogue||Hm? XX, you look perplexed. If someone has wronged you, I will have the guards on them in moments! 
Dialogue||It's nothing like that. I'm just thinking about our future.
Dialogue||Ah, our future. I cannot wait, XX! The city will be ours to share. With your charm and my ferocity, certainly we will go down in history as great leaders. 
Dialogue||XX, you little fool. I am quite happy with you. In fact, one day I will be Withergate's king and I want you beside me on the throne. 
Dialogue||You really think I'll be a good leader?
Dialogue||As long as we're together, then I don't care where we are.
Dialogue||You're already a leader, XX. I can see it in you. If you can't see it then you're not looking with your eyes, because it is clear as the moon to me. 
Dialogue||A silly thing to say, don't you think? Surely we would never forsake our power and responsibility to Withergate.[]We can stay together right here, XX.
Dialogue||There's only one way to make that happen.
Dialogue||Is that what's best for us?
Dialogue||Indeed, now you're catching on! Heheh, I mean that I am ready for you whenever you're ready for me. And don't worry about the ring - any kind will do, so long as it's from you. 
Dialogue||Of course it is. Do you doubt my word, XX? Or perhaps, you don't feel the way I do. 
Dialogue||Keep your eyes up, XX. It's hard to keep track of everyone in a crowd.													
Dialogue||Hey XX, taking a break from farming? It's healthy to have interests outside of work.
Dialogue||I was wondering, if you weren't a soldier then what job would you want?
Dialogue||Do you have a hobby outside of work?
Dialogue||That's a good question. I would still want to help people somehow, that's for sure. I think I'd like building houses.
Dialogue||I don't know if it counts as a hobby, but I'm pretty good at skipping stones across the lake.[]There's something about it that's mesmerizing. It should sink, but it skips instead. It's like a little miracle![]Does that make any sense, or am I just talking nonsense?
Dialogue||That's a surprising choice.
Dialogue||That makes perfect sense for you!
Dialogue||You think so? I did love making forts in the woods when I was a kid. At least, back when there was still some forested land left in the Great City. Now the Great City is all roads.
Dialogue||You think so? I did love making forts in the woods when I was a kid.[]Now the Great City is all roads, so there's nowhere left to make forts.
Dialogue||It makes sense to me.
Dialogue||That does sound a little silly.
Dialogue||Oh yeah? Well don't get me wrong - I know it comes down to good hand-eye coordination. But I like to think that the rock actually skips because it refuses to sink.[]Hey, I haven't told that to anyone!
Dialogue||Yeah, I know. I guess being a little silly just helps lift my spirits, sometimes.
Dialogue||Keep your chin up. Life is beautiful, even when it's hard. 
Dialogue||Do you have any advice for someone like me?
Dialogue||What do you do here, Judith?
Dialogue||I should have expected that - young people are always asking their elders for advice.[]Well kiddo, sometimes life guides you and sometimes you guide life. It's never too late to change your course if it feels like you're headed in the wrong direction.
Dialogue||Oh, I'm quite retired now. It's cute you mistook me for a working woman![]Before retirement, I was the town courier. Sun Haven really only needs one courier, so I was happy to pass the torch to Tonya when the time came.
Dialogue||Have you ever felt like you were going the wrong direction? 
Dialogue||Is there a story behind that? 
Dialogue||Certainly. I failed to make some changes like I should have, but I still ended up in a nice place.
Dialogue||Not one I care to tell right now. Maybe one day, farmer.
Dialogue||I bet people loved you delivering their mail.
Dialogue||Looking at you, I wouldn't have thought you were a courier.
Dialogue||Oh! Hehe, you're not wrong at all![]In fact, I don't think I bought myself a drink in the tavern for twenty years. My friends and neighbors always paid for me! It was a wonderful time.
Dialogue||Perhaps you should judge less with your eyes, farmer.
Dialogue||My sisters are really interested in you - um, by that I mean farmers. They've never seen food grow before.
Dialogue||Is your farm quiet at night? I'd love to relax in the field with you sometime.																											
Dialogue||How's your day goin', hun? You gettin' by all right?																																															
Dialogue||Once we started dating, I began planning a cake for our anniversary. I'm just telling you so I won't forget to finish!																																		
Dialogue||What do you think of my necklace? I want people to think I look rich, but not too rich. I think I nailed it!
Dialogue||Who do you actually like to hang out with in Sun Haven, anyway?
Dialogue||You look like a queen in a storybook! Do you ever read stories like that?
Dialogue||I don't know if I really "hang out" with anyone, but I've had a few good conversations with the doctor. Wornhardt is a good man, even if he doesn't know it.
Dialogue||I don't read a lot of book with characters in them. I mostly like to read books about places.[]It started as a way to get to know different cities that I was traveling to but, believe it or not, I actually enjoy it now! I know, sounds boring, huh?[]Well, there's a lot of history out there. And some of it is actually pretty fascinating!
Dialogue||You don't like to spend time with anyone here? 
Dialogue||I'm not one to gossip, but he's still working through some stuff from his past. If you really want to know, go talk to him about it. But don't expect him to open up right away.
Dialogue||I see plenty of people at work all day. Then, I hit the tavern. There's always someone there to talk with.[]Ronald and Mari run a good business, so I'll chat with them. Heck, they probably know me better than anyone - but you're a close second at this point!
Dialogue||Interesting! You must know things about a lot of different places.
Dialogue||That sounds... yeah, kind of boring.
Dialogue||Sure I do. Did you know this town began as an archeological dig site? Sun Haven has an interesting history. There's a book in the library that tells the whole story. You should read up on it!
Dialogue||Hey, you're the one who started a conversation about reading. That's on you. Anyway, a lot of the stuff I've learned has helped me in my business.[]For instance, don't try to sell earmuffs in the Eastern Region. They have a folk tale where somebody wears earmuffs for too long and their soul suffocates... or something like that.
Dialogue||Oh, it's you XX. This is fairly bad timing, I'm pretty busy right now.				
Dialogue||Enjoying the day? It's hard not to!																		
Dialogue||Liam takes real good care of us!				
Dialogue||I will always be the flame that lights your path, XX.																																																																													
Dialogue||Yesterday I found a really long bug behind the house! I showed it to Liam but he ran away. That's when I learned not everyone likes bugs.
Dialogue||You like bugs?
Dialogue||Did Liam really run away?
Dialogue||I think theyre weird. So, yes! You like bugs too, right?
Dialogue||My brother doesn't like bugs like me. One time he found little beetles in the flour and screamed!
Dialogue||Bugs are gross!
Dialogue||Bugs are cool!
Dialogue||Aww, you don't like them? Maybe you just haven't found the right bug.
Dialogue||You like them too?? Oh, I heard there's some real big bugs in the forest!
Dialogue||You must be brave to play with bugs. 
Dialogue||Be sure to wash your hands - bugs are dirty!
Dialogue||I don't know. It's fun to me, not scary.
Dialogue||That's what Liam always says. I'm really good about washing hands now.
Dialogue||Finally, someone I can talk to.[]Guess what, XX... I finally saw Elios today!
Dialogue||How'd it go??
Dialogue||So do you feel like a "Sun Haven Local" now?
Dialogue||Elios is so huge! I knew he'd be big, but it was pretty unnerving to stand right in front of him.[]But of course everything went fine. I didn't get any blessing, but he did tell me some really nice things.
Dialogue||I guess I know Sun Haven pretty well, but I still miss my home a lot. My family, too. I still don't quite know where I fit in here, to be honest.
Dialogue||Are you sad you weren't blessed?
Dialogue||What kinds of nice things?
Dialogue||Maybe a little disappointed... but honestly, I don't know if I could handle that right now. I already feel like I'm doing the most I can.[]If I suddenly became Blessed, I don't know what I would do!
Dialogue||Mostly he was talking about how strong I am. Can you believe it - a dragon telling me that I'm strong! It was amazing!
Dialogue||You're fitting in fine!
Dialogue||I could tell you were having some trouble.
Dialogue||Aw, really? Maybe I'm just overthinking again. Thanks XX.
Dialogue||You can tell? Maybe I really am the odd girl out here.
Dialogue||Hey everyone, my new best friend XX is here![]Eh, nevermind. Nobody's even paying attention.
Dialogue||Who do you hang out with, anyway?
Dialogue||I'm glad you said that. I feel like we're getting to be close friends, too.
Dialogue||There's nobody I like to hang with as much as you, XX. Which reminds me, I've been meaning to ask you out.[]Just a hangout with the two of us. What do you say?
Dialogue||That reminds me - hang on - ah, why'd I take it off the chain? Come on...[]Aha, got it! Here you go XX, from me to you. It's one of my dogtags!
Dialogue||That would be awesome!
Dialogue||I think I'd rather not.
Dialogue||Great, it's a plan! Meet me tomorrow at the manhole by the apartment building and we'll go from there. Let's say 12:00 pm!
Dialogue||Huh? All right then, my bad.
Dialogue||A gift? For me? From you?
Dialogue||You better not be joking!
Dialogue||Hey, I can do nice things too. Sometimes. Listen, I'm trying to be a good partner here. Just, take this.[]That's one of my dog tags. I can't say why, but it's important to me. Don't lose it, okay?
Dialogue||I have to say, Sun Haven has really been turning itself around lately. I hear you're the one to thank for that, XX.
Dialogue||Do you have any favorite customers around town?
Dialogue||Do you plan to ever leave Sun Haven?
Dialogue||Not trying to butt into my clientele, are we? Hah, just kidding XX! My favorite customer is the one handing me cash.[]But if you want a name, then it's Kitty. Whenever I have pet food, Kitty buys it all up right away!
Dialogue||You know, I think you asked me something similar when we first met. I think I said that if business didn't pick up, I'd have to leave.[]That's still true, but I really don't see myself leaving town anytime soon. Sun Haven's really bounced back!
Dialogue||Kitty buys <i>all</i> your pet food?
Dialogue||She does have lots of mouths to feed.
Dialogue||She might be a bit of a goof, but the girl does own her own business, after all. Seems like she's doing well for herself, too.
Dialogue||True, but I've seen her open a bag of the stuff and start munching on it right away![]She's a real character, but she pays well so I'm not complaining.
Dialogue||Looks like you owe me one.
Dialogue||Good, Sun Haven wouldn't be the same without you.
Dialogue||Excuse me? Listen, <i>maybe</i> you've had something to do with Sun Haven's dramatic turnaround, but the only one I owe for my profit is me. 
Dialogue||Nowhere is the same without me, XX! I'm a bit of an icon, if you haven't noticed. 
Dialogue||I hear music each time we speak, XX. A lovely duet.																																		
Dialogue||I polish my ring every night. Good metal needs to be taken care of.																																												
Dialogue||Sunny days are always nice, but I still appreciate a good gloomy day now and again.
Dialogue||Does Sun Haven get many gloomy days?
Dialogue||What do you like to do on a gloomy day?
Dialogue||Not usually. It's a bit out of our weather pattern, if you haven't realized that yet. I guess as a farmer, you would prefer it to be perfect farming weather, more often than not!
Dialogue||Well, it's a perfect excuse to relax at home. I like to lay back and maybe focus on mind games or a picture puzzle.[]If you try looking on the positive sides, then I believe you can find something good about almost any situation.
Dialogue||Sun Haven does seem to have predictable weather.
Dialogue||As long as the weather is fine for farming, I'm not bothered.
Dialogue||That's a good thing, though, isn't it? No big surprises must make your farming much easier.
Dialogue||Ah, if only everyone could be as laid back as you, XX. The world would be a better place.
Dialogue||You must be good at always seeing positive sides.
Dialogue||No way, I hate days that are gloomy.
Dialogue||It's a skill I've gotten very adept at, that's for sure. It all stems from not wanting to take any days for granted, no matter what they are.
Dialogue||I see. Not shocking, I suppose, as most people would probably agree with you. Still, I feel like you're missing out by not seeing the good in every day.
Dialogue||Looking to broaden your horizons? Follow your gut.																														
Dialogue||I'm a bit busy, but it's nice to see you.																																		 																																																										
Dialogue||Good to see you, farmer. You're putting on some muscle. About time.
Dialogue||I guess I am a little stronger these days.
Dialogue||What's the most difficult job you ever took?
Dialogue||Wear your muscles with pride, kid. They're the trophies of your hard work.
Dialogue||Most difficult? Hm. Guess it must've been about a year back. Customer walks in wanting mithril armor - for her bird.[]Guess she trained some kind of eagle to follow her into battle.
Dialogue||Calling your muscles trophies is kind of silly.
Dialogue||I don't like to gloat.
Dialogue||You think it's silly to work your hands raw for three decades? I didn't think so.
Dialogue||Heh, well that's good. But I'm not telling you to gloat. You can be proud of yourself and humble to others at the same time.[]I don't call myself a master, but I don't deny it either. Just keep working hard, kid.
Dialogue||What did you do? 
Dialogue||Is it even possible to make armor for a bird? 
Dialogue||Fulfilled the order, of course. I had to make it a loose chain mail so it'd be light enough, but we got that bird covered head to claw in mithril. 
Dialogue||It is if you know your metal. I hade to make it a loose chain mail so it'd be light enough, but we got that bird covered head to claw in mithril.
Dialogue||I cook the food and pour the drinks, but Mari is the beating heart of this place.																	
Dialogue||I love your scent. I can smell you a mile away!
Dialogue||Can you really smell me from a mile away?
Dialogue||What's my scent smell like?
Dialogue||Well not an <i>actual</i> mile. It's a figure of speech, I think. But I really do smell you before I see you... I don't know, maybe a couple blocks away?
Dialogue||It's a nice mix of fresh dirt and sweat. And maybe a hint of the beach. Is your farm close to the ocean?
Dialogue||That's not very far.
Dialogue||That's still pretty far!
Dialogue||I'm sorry, I didn't realize my nose was under review. Say, how far does your nose smell?
Dialogue||You think? Heh, thanks! It's not always a good thing though. I can smell Slobert halfway across the city...
Dialogue||Hey, that's pretty good!
Dialogue||I'm right next to the beach, actually.
Dialogue||I love smelling the beach. The closest thing we have here is either the river or the sewer. They just stink. But the beach stinks <i>good.</i> 
Dialogue||Yeah, I thought so! I love smelling the beach. The closest thing we have here is either the river or the sewer. They just stink. But the beach stinks <i>good.</i> 
Dialogue||Let's see, divide by six, carry the two... ugh, you're distracting me from my calculations, XX!																	
Dialogue||I wonder if Solon has plans for the smithery after he retires...																																																										
Dialogue||I've come to truly enjoy your presence, XX. Strange, since you're merely a farmer.
Dialogue||The more I get to know you, the more you already sound like a king.
Dialogue||You're truly an icon. I long to be more like you.
Dialogue||I hope that isn't surprise I hear in your voice. Don't forget who you're talking to. Royalty is in my blood.
Dialogue||The only way you could learn to be like me is by spending more time with me. Alone. Together.[]Perhaps we should... engage in a private meeting?
Dialogue||Yeah, but your dad seems way more kingly than you.
Dialogue||My prince, I only meant that Withergate will be lucky to have you as king.
Dialogue||Keep talking like that and you will beg my forgiveness when I hold the throne. Forgiveness I will not give.
Dialogue||Indeed. If everyone here treats me with the same respect you show me, then my rule will be easy.
Dialogue||If it pleases you, my prince!
Dialogue||I see. Forget it, it was a foolish idea anyway.
Dialogue||Of course it would. Be in front of the apartment building tomorrow at 5:00 pm. Don't make me wait around, XX...
Dialogue||I'd love to organize a Withergate chess tournament, but something else always seems to get in the way.  
Dialogue||You want to organize a chess tournament?
Dialogue||What's stopping you from organizing a chess tournament?
Dialogue||Of course. You remember I'm something of a monster at chess, don't you? I'd love to put my skills on display in a grand city-wide tournament, to show everyone who's boss.
Dialogue||Where do I begin! I'm backlogged out for the next two-hundred and eighty years.[]Mostly on urban expansion, though Darius constantly mentions wanting to add another seven wings onto Withergate Castle.
Dialogue||A chess tournament would be great for Withergate.
Dialogue||No one in Withergate would bother with a chess tournament.
Dialogue||Glad you agree, XX. I love all the other attractions Withergate has to offer, but I feel the city has always lacked something to really challenge the mind.[]I'll make it happen, one of these days.
Dialogue||Look at you, speaking so frank. Hey, guess what? I'm the one with all the public statistics and data! Remember that no one wants to hear your uninformed thoughts.[]Especially me.
Dialogue||Darius wants seven wings added to the castle?
Dialogue||Can't you just work harder?
Dialogue||He has this big, dramatic vision of seven spires topping the castle. It's so grand and ridiculous, so naturally I absolutely love the idea.[]But it'll add another thirty years of work, at least. Curse Darius and his impeccable taste in excessive architecture!
Dialogue||Gee, wow. Never thought about "just work harder", brilliant thinking, XX. I'm making fun of your stupid idea, of course.
Dialogue||I don't see why we can't just head into the forest and make a home somewhere.																																																																																						
Dialogue||This morning I met a traveler from the East. From what they said, the Eastern Region sounds beautiful!
Dialogue||You don't plan to ever leave Sun Haven for good, right Kitty?
Dialogue||I haven't asked, have you traveled much outside of Sun Haven?
Dialogue||Actually, I never thought about it before... Sun Haven is such a comfy home, the thought of leaving is so so sad!
Dialogue||Yes yes, I've gone across the big bridge once! ... Well actually, only halfway. Nyaaan - it's too scary!
Dialogue||I can't imagine staying.
Dialogue||I'd love to stay here with you.
Dialogue||Oh no... I don't know if I can leave, XX. If you leave, I might not come with you, nyan!
Dialogue||Ah! XX, that's a nice thought, nya. It will be so much more fun sharing this town with my partner!
Dialogue||I could walk across with you one day.
Dialogue||Wait, you've never even been across the bridge? 
Dialogue||You're so brave!! Let's do that one day, nya. In the meantime we can just chase butterflies in the grass, yeah yeah!
Dialogue||Don't tease me about it! There's a lot of water under that bridge, eep! No thanks!
Dialogue||Hi, farmer!
Dialogue||Who's your best friend in town?
Dialogue||Do you like school?
Dialogue||Topi is my best friend, but mama is my BEST best friend.
Dialogue||Yuck, no.
Dialogue||That might change when you grow up.
Dialogue||Your mama is lucky to have you!
Dialogue||Huh? I AM grown up! 
Dialogue||We have fun playing games every day, hehe!
Dialogue||Isn't there something you like about it?
Dialogue||We never learn anything important like hiding or sandcastles.
Dialogue||I like Mister Jun. He makes us laugh and sometimes he even has candy if we do good! 
Dialogue||Are you here to find a book, or are you planning to chat all day?
Dialogue||Lately I feel like I've been floating on air - even when I'm not!																														
Dialogue||Did Nel'Vari just get a little warmer? Oh, it's you, XX!																																							
Dialogue||I wanna learn how to fish! But Peter says he doesn't have time to teach me, and Rupert is always too shy to talk to Kitty, nya!
Dialogue||Rupert is shy around you?
Dialogue||Why do you want to learn how to fish?
Dialogue||Yup yup, whenever I try to talk to him he gets sooo embarrassed, he can't even be grumpy! I guess he never learned how to talk to cute girls, teehee!
Dialogue||Fish is my favorite food, you know that, right? Usually I just fish with my claws, but people using fishing rods catch sooo much more fish!![]It's against Kitty's better instinct as an Amari, but I must learn the secret of fishing rods, nya!
Dialogue||I wouldn't think he'd have such a soft side. 
Dialogue||I guess Rupert likes cats. 
Dialogue||Hehe. It's cute, but he still won't teach Kitty how to fish!
Dialogue||I couldn't picture you using a fishing rod.
Dialogue||If you ever learn, we could go fishing sometime!
Dialogue||Nyan?! Is it so strange Kitty wants to learn something new, XX?
Dialogue||Ohh, that's a fun idea! We could see who catches more fishies, and then Kitty could eat them all! Right?
Dialogue||Keep your eyes on the sea - she will tell you anything you need to know about the weather.
Dialogue||*ACHOO!* Ugh... Sorry, were you talking to me?											
Dialogue||Well if it isn't my beloved sewer rat.[]Oh, I'm sorry. Did you want me to stop calling you that? Never going to happen!
Dialogue||Maybe it's time I came up with a nickname for you.
Dialogue||You know, I don't even mind it anymore.
Dialogue||But you've been on my good side for so long. Do you really want to throw that all away, XX?
Dialogue||Hah, sure you don't! I can see your face twitch whenever I say it, XX. I keep my eyes open, remember?
Dialogue||Hm...
Dialogue||I can always get back on your good side.
Dialogue||Don't tell me you're actually considering![]Oh, of course you're joking. I can't believe I thought you were serious for a moment!
Dialogue||Big talk! But you better have a real good plan to win me back XX - I won't make it so easy the second time!
Dialogue||I don't know how you stay so attentive all the time.
Dialogue||If you're still on guard around me, then you need to relax.
Dialogue||Maybe I'm just attentive when it comes to you! Heh, I guess you'll never know.
Dialogue||It's not like that, it's more of an affectionate attention. But if you want me to stop, then maybe I'll just pay less attention to you.
Dialogue||Ah, the outsider. If you're staying, then you may call me "My Prince." The pleasure is yours.[]... Well?
Dialogue||So you're the prince of Withergate?
Dialogue||What exactly do you do here?
Dialogue||That should be obvious. Learn who you're speaking to before opening your mouth, peasant.
Dialogue||Do I look like an advisor to you? It's not my job to answer your questions.
Dialogue||Someone woke up on the wrong side of the bed this morning.
Dialogue||I beg forgiveness, my prince.
Dialogue||You don't seem to understand who you're addressing. Actually, I'll rephrase - you don't seem to understand how close I am to locking you in my dungeon.
Dialogue||That will do for now. Keep that up, and you might yet earn your place here.
Dialogue||I'm sorry, I didn't know.
Dialogue||Well if you're not an advisor then what is your job?
Dialogue||Consider yourself forgiven, but I can only accept so many of your mistakes.
Dialogue||Do you prefer a crowded jail cell or a solitary cage hanging from the ceiling? Oh nevermind - I'll surprise you.
Dialogue||I know everyone pretty well. It's easier getting to know people when you talk to them every day.																																																																																																																																																																	
Dialogue||I got a letter the other day from my mother. She can't believe I married someone as incredible as you!
Dialogue||What's so hard to believe about you marrying me?
Dialogue||How's everyone doing back home, anyways?
Dialogue||Well, I never told you this, but when we first started getting a little serious, I wrote to my mother about you. At first she didn't seem to approve of you.[]...But after hearing more about all the incredible things you've done, she really came around. I'd love it so much if you could meet one day in person.
Dialogue||Oh, everyone is getting by just well! They all say they miss me, but it's okay. They're never too far away, after all.
Dialogue||I'm glad I got her seal of approval.
Dialogue||Your mother seems really judgy.
Dialogue||She can be a bit old fashioned, but she always means well. She knows farming is dutiful and important, but she always envisioned me with someone "worthy."[]I guess you're more than worthy for her taste, XX!
Dialogue||She can be... really old fashioned, yeah. But she means well. I hope you don't think she's too judgmental or anything.
Dialogue||How long does it take to get back to your home village? 
Dialogue||You should visit them all.
Dialogue||Well, it's about two days by train, but that's only because it takes a day to travel from East Station to the Mountain Station.[]The two train stations aren't connected by rails yet, but someday they will be. Then going right from Sun Haven to my village will be a single train ride![]We'll be able to visit all the time, and my mother will finally see why you're the one I married, no matter what she thinks!
Dialogue||That's a wonderful idea, but I could never visit them without bringing you! We're both a bit busy for that right now, though.[]It's just two days of travel by train, but the railroad ends at the Eastern Station, so you have to travel on foot to the Montain Station to continue on to my village.[]Someday, though, the railroads will be connected, and it'll be a straight shot from Sun Haven to my village![]We'll be able to visit all the time, and my mother will finally see why you're the one I married, no matter what she thinks!
Dialogue||I'm eager to rule with you by my side, one day. The future has never looked so dark!
Dialogue||Don't you mean bright?
Dialogue||Do you think I'll be welcomed by the citizens?
Dialogue||Hm? I said what I meant, XX! I wince at the thought of a bright future. Of course, I understand you live your life in the sunlight. But one day, you will join us in beautiful darkness.
Dialogue||You will be welcomed, I'll make sure of it. Anyone who dares criticise you will answer to me. And trust me, it only takes one strong example for a whole city to learn a lesson.
Dialogue||I can't wait for that day.
Dialogue||When do you think that day will come?
Dialogue||Neither can I, XX. My father has many years yet to rule, however. In the meantime, let us simply enjoy each other's company. And the power of a prince, of course. 
Dialogue||My father has many years yet to rule, however. In the meantime, let us simply enjoy each other's company. And the power of a prince, of course. 
Dialogue||That sounds almost wicked.
Dialogue||I can't wait until I can wield power like yours.
Dialogue||Yes, exactly... though I don't know why you say that like it's a bad thing.
Dialogue||Patience, my love. You have to learn how to use it first. Of course, your teacher is well-versed in the different uses of power. 
Dialogue||I wonder if I'll ever see a real battle... I hope not.											
Dialogue||Farmer.
Dialogue||How did you become a master blacksmith?
Dialogue||You have a reputation as a tough teacher.
Dialogue||A lifetime of putting iron to the forge will do that.[]Anyway, can't be any kind of blacksmith before you've got an anvil. Have you made yourself one?
Dialogue||You're darn right, I do. You don't learn discipline by being coddled.
Dialogue||Of course I have. 
Dialogue||Of course I have... not.
Dialogue||Then you're ready to make your own gear, which means you need ore. Take the minecart into the mines to get some ore. Go on, put that pickaxe I gave you to work.
Dialogue||You'll need ore to craft one. Take the minecart into the mines to get some ore. Go on, put that pickaxe I gave you to work.
Dialogue||Hard work is the best teacher there is.
Dialogue||What if you tried a more positive teaching strategy?
Dialogue||That's right. Sounds like the farm fell into capable hands. 
Dialogue||More positive? The only thing I'm positive about is this - you're a total ninny.
Dialogue||A hot cup always perks me up in the morning.			 					
Dialogue||Every night I go to sleep thinking of all the couples I've helped along.										
Dialogue||I never learned to use a sword. I wonder if that's a problem?																								
Dialogue||Enjoying Withergate? There's always something to do here.
Dialogue||What do you do here in your down time?
Dialogue||So do you like this city a lot?
Dialogue||I talk to people, sniff around, look for something fun. I don't really like having down time, so I try to find something to do as soon as I can.
Dialogue||This place is a great home base when I need one. Lots of good food and new people to talk to. Yeah, it's a nice spot when you've got nowhere else to go.
Dialogue||I agree, I hate wasting a day.
Dialogue||I don't like being busy all the time.
Dialogue||Right? Some people just want to put their feet up, but my feet are restless. You and I are more alike than I thought, XX.
Dialogue||I get it. Taking life slow can be nice, but it's not my style.
Dialogue||There are rumors in Sun Haven that Withergate is a dangerous place.
Dialogue||Have you lived here for a long time?
Dialogue||Those Humans are so funny! Look around and tell me where the danger is. The hat shop? Oh I know, the pet shop! Aw, you're scared of hamsters, how cute.
Dialogue||The Demons only opened the city up to monsterfolk maybe ten years ago. Even though Amari aren't really considered monsterfolk, you can bet I was one of the first ones here.[]Come on, a city of darkness? How could I resist!?
Dialogue||You know, in the right light you don't look half bad, XX!
Dialogue||Hold on, I think that's the first time you've ever used my real name!
Dialogue||That was barely a compliment, by the way.
Dialogue||Don't worry, you'll always be a sewer rat to me.
Dialogue||That's about as good as my compliments get. But maybe I'm just lacking a good example. Go ahead farmer, lay one on me.
Dialogue||Well I wouldn't want you to like me too much.
Dialogue||And you'll always be a bully!
Dialogue||Don't get ahead of yourself. One little date doesn't make us best friends.
Dialogue||Aw, you do know me! How sweet of you, XX.
Dialogue||Your breath is tolerable today.
Dialogue||Your strength is rivalled only by your beauty.
Dialogue||Aw, you mean it? That's the nicest thing anyone has ever said to me! Thanks XX, you really know how to treat a girl right.
Dialogue||... I don't know what I was prepared for, but it was not that. I think I'm sick to my stomach.
Dialogue||You are Withergate's third most important person, but you will forever be the most important to me.																																																																																	 									
Dialogue||Vaan told me you're a farmer. Why didn't you tell me that you work with plants, too??
Dialogue||I know you work mostly with plants, but have you ever tried your magic on animals?
Dialogue||Do you enjoy working with plants all the time?
Dialogue||Casting enchantments on animals is a big mistake. The spell has to be exactly correct because even the tiniest miscalculation can have huge effects. Trees and rocks are safer, trust me.
Dialogue||Oh yeah, I absolutely love plants! It's why I've dedicated my work to them, of course. They're so important to our world, don't you agree?
Dialogue||You didn't answer the question.
Dialogue||You seem to know a lot about how difficult it is.
Dialogue||... Okay look, I only tried it once when I was really young. I took a bucket of worms and tried to make them all bigger. Instead I made a kind of... worm ball. It wasn't pretty and I never tried again.
Dialogue||I don't really care for plants.
Dialogue||Absolutely, plants keep us all alive!
Dialogue||How can you think that?
Dialogue||That's exactly right, we wouldn't last a year without plants. No wonder you found your way into Nel'Vari - you really think like one of us!
Dialogue||Hi Nathaniel - OH! I'm so sorry, XX! My brain just got mixed up for a moment there.
Dialogue||Hey, XX. I always have a moment for you.									
Dialogue||Do your friends ask about me? Ooh, tell them I'm a ghost - that would really freak them out!																													
Dialogue||Darius and Cordelia are both behind on their work for King Minos... Once again, Xyla picks up the slack.																														
Dialogue||Hey XX! I'm glad to see you, I was getting pretty bored.
Dialogue||Are you just talking to me because you're bored, or because you like me?
Dialogue||If you're bored, tell me the wildest thing that happened to you last week.
Dialogue||That's a hard question, XX. On the one hand, I'm very bored. On the other, I actually do like you for some reason. I guess I just don't know how to answer the question.
Dialogue||Last week... Oh, you've heard of Elementals? People made of fire or ice or whatever? I was sitting on a rock taking a rest and... Yep, it was an elemental.[]This lady was not happy to wake up under my butt, let me tell you. She threw me so far, I landed in a harpy's nest halfway up a tree.[]The upside? Harpy omelettes for breakfast the next day!
Dialogue||What do you mean, "for some reason?"
Dialogue||Sounds like you're avoiding the question...
Dialogue||Don't take it the wrong way - I just mean that I usually don't hang around the same people for too long. But I like chatting it up with you.
Dialogue||There's no way that's all true.
Dialogue||Harpy's eggs? I've never had them, but I'll try anything.
Dialogue||Believe it or not, I don't care. I know what happened.
Dialogue||That's the right kind of attitude! Heck, I'll even make you an omelette someday.
Dialogue||Hey, XX. Have you gotten a chance to check out everything we sell at the smithy?
Dialogue||How is life in Sun Haven different from back home?
Dialogue||You seem to be adjusting to life in Sun Haven.
Dialogue||Oh, that's such a good question. Well, for starters, Sun Haven might be a pretty small town to you, but it's so much bigger than my home village![]The oddest thing in Sun Haven is that I make stuff that we turn around and sell. We make so much stuff every single day![]Back home, our village is so small that everything the blacksmiths make is meant for use by the villagers.
Dialogue||Oh, do you mean that? I'll be real honest, at first I actually wasn't sure if I'd ever really like living here. But the more the days go by, the more I think I'm really fitting in!
Dialogue||That sounds like a very tight-knit community.
Dialogue||Sounds awful, I bet you're glad you came to Sun Haven.
Dialogue||I suppose it is, isn't it? Our blacksmiths make some spare money from repairing or replacing parts, but mostly our little village shares what everyone makes.[]It's very quaint, and Sun Haven is a lot different. But that doesn't mean I don't like it here! Sun Haven is so big and full of people and things, which is nice in its own way.
Dialogue||You think my home sounds awful? I'm sorry you think that, but I guess I understand why. They're two very different places, after all...
Dialogue||Sun Haven is better with you here.
Dialogue||You're going to do just fine, Lynn.
Dialogue||You mean even little ol' me makes a difference? That's very sweet of you to say, XX.[]I want nothing more than to honor my heritege as a blacksmith by mastering all of the advanced techniques that Solon can teach me!
Dialogue||Thanks, XX. I'm really starting to think so, too.[]I want nothing more than to honor my heritage as a blacksmith by mastering all of the advanced techniques that Solon can teach me!
Dialogue||My sword? Custom made.																																																													
Dialogue||You're so breathtaking.[]Oh! Was that out loud or just in my head? Heh, nevermind!																									
Dialogue||Look here, it's the Withergate Wannabe! You just can't stay away can you?
Dialogue||Do you have any plans for Withergate?
Dialogue||So you like it in Withergate?
Dialogue||One word: expansion. I've clearly done a bang-up job with the space we have here, but I want to see Withergate become a real metropolis!
Dialogue||If I didn't, don't you think I'd leave? Of course I like it here! In a city of dimwitted monsters and demons, a person like me can have a lot of fun.
Dialogue||That seems a little idealistic.
Dialogue||A monster metropolis, huh? If anyone can do it, it would be you.
Dialogue||Idealistic is thinking you can snap off little comments like that without getting called out. Seriously outsider, who do you think you're talking to?
Dialogue||You've got an eye for aptitude. You're sharper than you look, outsider.
Dialogue||That sounds a little mean.
Dialogue||You definitely have confidence going for you.
Dialogue||No need to get your feelings hurt, outsider. I'm not trying to hurt your feelings or anything. If I was, you would know it.
Dialogue||Take it from me, confidence will take you places in this town. Flattery, on the other hand, will not... Unless you catch me on a good day.
Dialogue||What are you looking at me for?								
Dialogue||I've heard that some people play music for their plants. It's supposed to help them grow. Putting music and plants together, I think it's a fantastic idea.
Dialogue||What kind of music would you play to a plant?
Dialogue||Do you think music really makes plants grow?
Dialogue||I don't know. I like to think that even music has an aura. The sounds and vibrations and rhythm, all of it has an energy to it. At least, that's what I think.[]Maybe it depends on how I want the plant to grow. Noisy and loud for big and bountiful, quiet and reserved for soft and small? Who knows!
Dialogue||I don't know! Really, I just think it sounds like fun, even if it doesn't work. Besides, it's a good excuse to listen to a lot of music.
Dialogue||You seem to have lots of questions about the world.
Dialogue||That's a lot for me to get my head around.
Dialogue||Hehe, I'm sure it didn't take you this long to notice that, XX. Life is a mystery, and I like to figure it out.
Dialogue||It might seem pretty crazy, but that's how I like to think. Life is a mystery, and I like to figure it out.
Dialogue||Sounds like it might be a waste of time.
Dialogue||I can picture you playing your music to all your plants now.
Dialogue||Nothing is a waste of time if you enjoy doing it. Try to live without limiting yourself to things you think are "worth the time", XX. I certainly do. 
Dialogue||It is kind of funny, huh? I told you it sounded fun! Now I'll have to try it sometime. It'll be interesting to see if it really works or not![]Of course, it's really the fun of it that counts, right? 
Dialogue||The days have all been so beautiful lately. Rain or shine, I could get lost just gazing up at the clouds as they roll by.
Dialogue||Do you ever predict bad things in the future?
Dialogue||Don't you read clouds?
Dialogue||I predict all sorts of things. Sometimes good, sometimes bad. It's important to always take an unbiased stance towards any prediction, though.[]It's not up to me to decide what fate entails, I just translate the meaning from what I see. It's hard to be totally unbiased, though.
Dialogue||Well, the study of aeromancy involves studying the shape and consistency of clouds to predict fates. Most of the time I'm not that serious about cloud watching,though.[]Sometimes it's nice to disconnect from all of that and just relax, not thinking about anything.
Dialogue||Sounds complex.
Dialogue||You sound like you have a good grasp on it.
Dialogue||It is a bit tricky, but once you've been at it for awhile it gets a lot easier. The hardest part is clearing your mind and staying receptive to the universe.
Dialogue||Cloud watching sounds like a boring pastime.
Dialogue||That sounds very peaceful.
Dialogue||Hm, I didn't know I had asked for your opinion.
Dialogue||It really is. You should try it sometime. Even if it's just for relaxation, our minds and bodies - and our energy! - need that from time to time. 
Dialogue||Ronald and Mari got plenty of work for me. I even got my own bed upstairs!											
Dialogue||Whenever I see Topi and Pod running around, I know it's only a matter of time before I'll need to treat a scraped knee. I've already got bandages in my pocket, just in case.									
Dialogue||Don't try me, outsider, or I'll show you what these horns can do.																						
Dialogue||I used to be quite an adventurer. Not unlike yourself!					 					
Dialogue||Maybe I should be spending more time at the beach... What do you think?																	
Dialogue||Are you having trouble making friends in town, too?
Dialogue||What, haven't you made any friends since you moved here?
Dialogue||Have you met Elios yet?
Dialogue||Well, I really like Lucia. She speaks with such confidence. I can see why she's the leader here.[]Oh, and Nathaniel! He's so tall and strong...  Oh my, I can't believe I just said that! Forget you heard anything!
Dialogue||Lucia thinks I should wait and get more adjusted to the town first. I'm fine with waiting, because the journey sounds a bit scary.
Dialogue||Don't worry, I won't say a thing.
Dialogue||I didn't hear anything!
Dialogue||Oh, phew. I'm having a hard enough time here without people gossiping about me.
Dialogue||You can't let everyone tell you what to do all the time.
Dialogue||It's smart of you to wait until you know you're ready.
Dialogue||Do you think so? I didn't think it was that big of a deal...
Dialogue||You think so? I was worried that I was just being a chicken, but hearing you say that tells me I made the right choice.
Dialogue||Oh, you again. Welcome to the party.
Dialogue||You say that like it's not a party.
Dialogue||Why did you choose to become a soldier?
Dialogue||Yeah, that's on purpose. There's no party here.
Dialogue||It was my last option. I dropped out of my apprenticeship and didn't feel like delivering baby griffons for a living like my parents. So, here I am. Soldier boy.
Dialogue||You should just leave if you hate it here.
Dialogue||You're a breath of fresh air.
Dialogue||Listen, I don't hate it here. I don't love it either. I'm just bored.
Dialogue||Hah, good one. 
Dialogue||Well this isn't so bad compared to that, huh?
Dialogue||So you don't have any personal interest in being a soldier?
Dialogue||You're not wrong, but that's a low bar.
Dialogue||Not a bit. But it pays well and I get free food, so it's good enough for me.
Dialogue||Guard duty isn't the most interesting work, but there's usually someone interesting to talk to - like you!									 					
Dialogue||You're a good farmer, XX. I'm happy to see the old farm in your hands.																																																																									
Dialogue||Hi, citizen. Oh, you're the new arrival huh? Neat.
Dialogue||My name's XX. What's yours?
Dialogue||I'm Calvin. Welcome to paradise.
Dialogue||Tonya works hard delivering mail, so I don't mind watching Topi during the day.									
Dialogue||How's the farm, XX? I wish I had more time to visit and see how far it's coming.																																																																																																					
Dialogue||Farmers are good because they make food. That's what Mama says.																																													
Dialogue||I'm not really in a mood to talk, thanks. I've got a lot on my mind.
Dialogue||I have plenty of work of my own to focus on, sorry I can't join you in the fields, love!									
Dialogue||Huh? Who are you? 
Dialogue||My name's XX.
Dialogue||XX? Dumb name. Mine's Slobert.
Dialogue||Sometimes Emma and I stick our fingers in the sugar when Liam isn't looking... Hehehe.							
Dialogue||Consider this: plants can't live without animals, and animals can't live without plants. The solution? Balance.													
Dialogue||I'm trying to find a good book for the kids to read, but I've almost read everything the library has to offer.
Dialogue||Maybe you could make up your own stories.
Dialogue||What kind of books do you like to read personally?
Dialogue||Heh, that's a creative idea! I'm afraid I'm not as creative as you, though. I've tried storytelling before, and I'm no good unless the story is written down.
Dialogue||This is a little embarrassing, but I'm a sucker for a good romance. Anything with a "happily ever after" does the trick for me.
Dialogue||I bet you could become a great writer with practice!
Dialogue||You don't have to tell me.
Dialogue||Ah, thanks! I'm not so sure, but everything is worth a proper try, I suppose.
Dialogue||Oh... I'm sorry, have I bored you with my stories in the past? Or... do you mean right now? Hm.
Dialogue||Romance? I should have known!
Dialogue||Romance? I don't see the appeal.
Dialogue||Why, uh, do you say that? Actually you know what, don't answer that question.
Dialogue||No, not even a little? That's too bad. I have one I thought was perfect for you, but I guess I'll just return it to the library.
Dialogue||Grandfather would be so proud to see me now. He'd be proud of you, too, XX. I know it.																																																												
Dialogue||I'd love to keep talking, but I'm a bit too busy right now. I'm sure I'll see you later!						
Dialogue||For the first time in a long while, the future looks brighter than the present.
Dialogue||Do you remember when we first met?
Dialogue||Sun Haven seems to be doing better these days.
Dialogue||Of course I do! In hindsight, I'm glad Nathaniel walked off with Lynn after you two arrived. I was glad to make an impression of you right away!
Dialogue||I've noticed the same thing! Some extra traffic in town is long overdue, so I'm certainly glad to see it now.[]The flames are finally catching, XX. I'm sure Sun Haven will be a roaring fire again soon.
Dialogue||What did you think of me at first?
Dialogue||Were you expecting someone like me?
Dialogue||Well... I was just excited that you were taking over the farm. We needed a farmer quite badly, as you know.[]Actually, it was more than that. I was impressed by the risk you took, moving here. You were surprising me right from the beginning, XX!
Dialogue||It's better not to get our hopes up.
Dialogue||I feel like I could live here forever.
Dialogue||For once XX, I disagree. Now is exactly when to get our hopes up.
Dialogue||I've felt that way for a long time now, XX. But having you here makes it that much easier. I know we have a bright future together!
Dialogue||You'll like it here, I can already tell.	 					
Dialogue||Oh, the farmer. I have a nice view of your farm from my upper story.[]Um, did you want to talk for some reason?
Dialogue||I haven't seen you around too much.
Dialogue||That giant house is all yours??
Dialogue||I'm not surprised. I'm usually quite busy at home.
Dialogue||That's right. Living alone in a spacious home helps me focus on my work
Dialogue||What brings you out today?
Dialogue||Do you need help with anything?
Dialogue||I'm hoping to get some inspiration from a new record... again. It won't be long before I buy every record in the store, I swear.
Dialogue||I suppose so, but not help you can give me.[]I'm hoping to get some inspiration from a new record... again. It won't be long before I buy every record in the store, I swear.
Dialogue||That sounds miserable.
Dialogue||It sounds great to have all that space to yourself!
Dialogue||Call me miserable, then.
Dialogue||You think so? Well that makes two of us.
Dialogue||Seeing you run around town brightens my day.									
Dialogue||Good food, fun atmosphere. This place is pretty slick!						 					
Dialogue||Why hello again, farmer. Good to see you're getting to know our town.[]Do you care to chat for a bit?
Dialogue||I wanted to say, Catherine is a lovely name.
Dialogue||Last time we talked you said you were a witch.
Dialogue||And here I thought I was the charmer! I'm glad to see our newest new neighbor isn't just a stick in the mud.
Dialogue||That's right. Don't tell me that concerns you? Certainly you've already met Lucia.[]She doesn't practice witchcraft like I do, but she is Blessed. If her internal connection with magic didn't put you off, I'm sure you won't mind my witchcraft.
Dialogue||What do you mean, newest new neighbor?
Dialogue||Did you expect me to be a stick in the mud?
Dialogue||I only just met the other new arrival, Lynn. Sweet little thing, but not very outspoken.[]Nothing against her, but I need someone to keep up with the conversation you know? I feel like such a blabbermouth when someone doesn't talk as much as me.
Dialogue||Not really. It's just that most farmers I've met are not quite as... spirited as you. I promise I mean that in a good way!
Dialogue||So you practice dark magic?
Dialogue||I don't mind it one bit!
Dialogue||I'll only say this once so don't forget - dark magic is for dark wizards. Witches - like me! - practice magic without hurting other people or animals. Got it?
Dialogue||I don't even need to read your aura to see that we will get along famously.
Dialogue||Have you seen my boy today? Oh nevermind, it's impossible to keep an eye on him.								
Dialogue||Have you been doing your own smithing? If not, you should give it a try. I bet you'd be great at it!																																	
Dialogue||You've shown me the kind of happiness I didn't think was possible, XX.																																																	
Dialogue||Is it just me, or does Sun Haven feel like a different town than it did a few weeks ago?[]I guess you never can know what the future holds.
Dialogue||So then, what's the next step for your future?
Dialogue||Nathaniel, What's your proudest moment?
Dialogue||You mean after the service? Hm, I don't really know.[]Maybe I really could try to be a sailor, like we talked about.
Dialogue||My proudest moment? Hm... out of all my time in the military, one day stands out.[]It was very early in my career. Walking home one night, I heard a lady scream about a monster, so I ran to assist. I put myself between her and the monster and drew my sword.[]The monster turned out to be a raccoon eating a really big fish, but I was still proud of my response! That's when I knew I had the instincts of a real soldier.
Dialogue||That's a great idea!
Dialogue||You really think you could?
Dialogue||So you weren't just humoring me on our date?[]Heh, nobody's ever supported a dream of mine that wasn't about the military. In fact, I don't know if I've <i>had</i> a dream that wasn't about the military.
Dialogue||If my military time has taught me anything, it's that I can do anything I set my mind to - even if not everyone thinks so.
Dialogue||That's a pretty heroic story... I guess.
Dialogue||Monster or not, you sprung into action!
Dialogue||It was an important moment for me, so I don't even care what anyone else thinks about it.
Dialogue||Exactly! Most people just laugh at that story, but you see things the same way I do.
Dialogue||I heard we were getting a new neighbor. Welcome to Sun Haven, my name's Giuseppe. 
Dialogue||What an interesting name! My name is XX.
Dialogue||You think so? I come from a town on the border of the Northern and Eastern Regions. It's a pretty standard name there.
Dialogue||A peaceful society starts with the citizens.						
Dialogue||Maybe someday I can visit your farm. It would be interesting to combine your farming with my enchanting.																																																								
Dialogue||Welcome. I'm Amanda, the librarian. Please treat my books with respect.
Dialogue||My name is XX. Happy to meet you.
Dialogue||Mhm, sure you are. Anyway, please be quiet while you're here.
Dialogue||Huh? What, is there an emergency? Didn't think so...											
Dialogue||I thought I saw someone flying in the sky over Sun Haven today. I must have been mistaken, right?																																																																																														
Dialogue||My sisters are already talking about you like a parental figure. I hope that doesn't weird you out.
Dialogue||I think that's sweet.
Dialogue||I haven't been a parent before.
Dialogue||Ah, thank goodness for you XX. You're not only perfect for me, but you seem perfect for my sisters too.
Dialogue||Don't worry, I'm still figuring it out too. For the most part, I just try to keep them clean and fed. It's been working so far!
Dialogue||I don't mind them, as long as you're doing the work.
Dialogue||I'm so happy to be part of your family, Liam!
Dialogue||You don't want to help? Not even a little bit? Oh sheesh... we might have a problem, XX.
Dialogue||Honestly, it's a relief having someone to help carry the load. You're too good for me, XX.
Dialogue||There must be more to it than that?
Dialogue||Haven't you had any trouble with them?
Dialogue||Honestly, the girls are big enough now to stay out of trouble on their own.[]Sometimes I need to do a little parenting, sure, but they're already very mature for their ages. I lucked out with Emma and Elizabeth!
Dialogue||Judith is my wife. Can you believe it, we've been married 29 years!									
Dialogue||What time is it? I'm already feeling drowsy...									
Dialogue||Settling in all right, are we?[]What's on your mind, farmer?
Dialogue||Have you lived here your whole life, doctor?
Dialogue||You're the only doctor in Sun Haven?
Dialogue||No, I relocated from the Southern Islands just about a year ago. The south is great, but I'm lucky to be here. Sun Haven has been good for me.
Dialogue||Don't worry, I'm well-equipped to take care of this town. Besides, almost everyone here is in great health. It's honestly a little boring for me, but I'd much rather be bored than stressed out.
Dialogue||Do you miss the Southern Region?
Dialogue||The south? But you're so... 
Dialogue||I'll tell you what I do miss, the fruit. Fruit trees grow all over the place down there. I used to pick a free breakfast while walking to work every day! One less thing to worry about, you know?
Dialogue||I know what you're going to say - I'm very pale. Believe me, it was a challenge growing up on a tropical island with this complexion.
Dialogue||Some people might think that makes you sound lazy.
Dialogue||More people could use a little boredom in their life.
Dialogue||It's a good thing I don't care what some people think!
Dialogue||I agree completely. I always feel better after slowing down and taking a breath. Sun Haven has let me to do that more than ever before.
Dialogue||Peter is like a nephew to me. I taught him everything he knows! Everything he knows about fishin', anyway.					
Dialogue||XX, glad to see you. I don't need anything, or anything like that. I mean, it's just nice seeing you is all.[]Er, do you have a question for me? You look like you have a question for me.
Dialogue||I was wondering, do you like to read much?
Dialogue||What's more important to you, being rich or being happy?
Dialogue||Sure! At least, I think I still do. I haven't finished a book in a long time.
Dialogue||Well, being happy is always most important. But it's a lot easier being happy when you've got money... Or, it makes life easier, at least. Ah, does that make me a bad person?
Dialogue||Why is that?
Dialogue||What if you made that a new goal?
Dialogue||Maybe because I'm busy. But, also maybe because I haven't found anything good to read? It's hard to tell.
Dialogue||Sure, I actually feel like I can take on a new goal right now. Will you choose the book for me? I really like adventure novels!
Dialogue||No, you're right. Being comfortable is important.
Dialogue||Money doesn't buy happiness, Liam.
Dialogue||Oh, phew. I thought for sure you'd think I was a greedy person.
Dialogue||Maybe not, but a lack of money sure can make life harder.
Dialogue||Roza has been on me lately. She says she caught me sleeping on the job, but I don't remember that happening.						
Dialogue||Working in Sun Haven is a challenge. I never treated Amari patients before coming here!
Dialogue||Was being a doctor easier where you used to live?
Dialogue||Wouldn't it be easier if you could just chill out all day?
Dialogue||Not necessarily "easier". I used to only provide care to Human patients, but medicine is still difficult whether you're treating a Human or an Amari.[]Maybe "simpler" is a better way of putting it. Do you have any idea how good Catherine is at hearing, for instance? Giving her a hearing exam is a real challenge!
Dialogue||It would! But I have to earn my living somehow. Besides, if I got lazy and stopped working, people wouldn't be taken care of. Sure, a new doctor would come around, but...[]The only way I know for sure that everyone is getting what they need is to do it myself.
Dialogue||Broadening your horizons never hurt.
Dialogue||So you're saying Catherine has super-hearing? 
Dialogue||I've come to appreciate learning more about caring for a diverse range of patients, at least. It's a tough job but someone's gotta do it, and I'm happy it can be me.
Dialogue||Ehh, alright, forget we talked about that, alright? Catherine is a little sensitive of how well her ears work compared to Humans...[]I shouldn't have went off and revealed my patient's private matters. Man, where's a windmill when you need one?
Dialogue||You don't have to stress so much.
Dialogue||Sounds like you're a bit egotistical. 
Dialogue||You're right. Jun tells me the same thing. I have trouble worrying about everyone's health whenever I take a break, though. Maybe I do need a vacation...[]A short one, at least. 
Dialogue||Oof, is that how it comes off? I'm just concerned for everyone's well-being.
Dialogue||I never told you, I think it's really impressive how you found your way into NelVari!
Dialogue||Have you been outside of Nel'Vari much?
Dialogue||How do you feel about Nel'Vari being so secretive?
Dialogue||Mostly just to gather different kinds of plants. I don't like to stray too far, though. The farther I get from Nel'Vari, the more I worry. I can't explain it exactly, but it feels like being exposed.
Dialogue||I think it's a bit much, honestly. But the Elder can tell you stories of intruders from the past. I guess our culture came close to being wiped out, once.[]It's frightening stuff, so I understand why we take precautions now.
Dialogue||The world is a big place, it can be intimidating.
Dialogue||That's silly, you should explore the world.
Dialogue||It's something like that, yeah. It's nice that you understand - even if I don't fully understand myself.
Dialogue||I don't think it's silly at all. I'm happy here, so why leave?
Dialogue||Do you worry about that happening again?
Dialogue||With that in mind, it makes sense that you would hide yourselves.
Dialogue||No, I'm not worried. It's not worth the risk to our society to <i>not</i> have the protection spell in place.
Dialogue||I came to the same realization when the Elder told me what happened.[]You're really starting to see things like a Nel'Vari Elf! I'm glad the Elder welcomed you into our home.
Dialogue||That Pod is a troublemaker, but I don't mind it. Topi's such a calm boy, he could stand to get into a little mischief.												
Dialogue||I'm smiling a lot lot more now. And that's saying something, nya!																																																								
Dialogue||I'll remember our wedding day for the rest of my life, XX.																																																																					
Dialogue||I wonder what Sun Haven will look like in one hundred years.			 					
Dialogue||Mari and I have poured our hearts into this place.																						
Dialogue||Don't you feel Sun Haven picking up speed? It almost feels like it did ten years ago!
Dialogue||Do you think Sun Haven is actually going to bounce back?
Dialogue||Do you think you'll miss the peace and quiet?
Dialogue||I've always had faith in our little home, you know that. Maybe I'm reading into some misleading energies, but I really think Sun Haven turned a corner recently.
Dialogue||Maybe, but there will always be a quiet corner of Sun Haven. That's part of why I love it here. No matter who you are, there's a place for you here.
Dialogue||I think I've noticed the same thing. Sun Haven is coming back!
Dialogue||One day I hope to be as optimistic as you.
Dialogue||I'm so excited for you to see the town in its prime! Oh, and the tavern is so fun when it's full of strange travelers. XX, I'm glad you're here for this.
Dialogue||It's not optimism, XX. Optimism has no basis. I'm going off of things I see and feel. There's a big difference.
Dialogue||I know I've got a place here... with you!
Dialogue||I'm just glad we can stop worrying so much for the town's future.
Dialogue||Oh, extra cheesy today? Mm, I love that kind of cheese!
Dialogue||Maybe, but let's not declare victory just yet. We shouldn't slow down before we're there, you know?[]XX, let's keep working to make Sun Haven the best it can be!
Dialogue||Hoy, XX! Can you feel that wind? It's going to be a beautiful day.[]You have a question for me?
Dialogue||So are you from Sun Haven originally?
Dialogue||Have you always been a fisherman?
Dialogue||I've lived here all my life, so you tell me! Yep, I know this town backward and forward. Not a thing I would change about it. Other towns just can't compare. 
Dialogue||Not always. I used to run trade with my ship, but I got tired of that. I don't like traveling on routes as much as sailing the sea freely.
Dialogue||There are a few things I would change...
Dialogue||I'll take your word for it!
Dialogue||Well, change them or don't. Complaints don't solve a thing.
Dialogue||Well I've visited every port town on the western coast, so I'm not just blowing hot air here!
Dialogue||Does fishing allow you more freedom, then?
Dialogue||Did you like having a trade ship?
Dialogue||Sure does! Now I just follow the weather and my own natural instinct. The sea guides me.
Dialogue||It was a decent living with regular work. Boring, though. Not nearly as exciting as feeling the first nibble on the end of your fishing line.
Dialogue||Hey, neighbor. I'll introduce myself - I'm Raimi. People might tell you I'm the toughest guy in town, but that's just what people say. 
Dialogue||Good meeting you Raimi, I'm XX.
Dialogue||Oh, XX? Thaaat's right, you're the farmer we've been expecting. We really needed someone to clean up that old farm. Great to have you!
Dialogue||Finding this café felt to me like fate. I know that's a strong statement, but it comes from a strong feeling!						 					
Dialogue||We're supposed to guard against monsters, but I don't think the monsters even care to show up.						
Dialogue||What, haven't seen a spirit before?					 					
Dialogue||Do you know King Aster? He's going to treat me to a banquet... I'm his royal guest!										
Dialogue||I was just thinking about you, XX![]I have some free time. Want to chat?
Dialogue||Say, what kind of music do you like?
Dialogue||Do you like pets, Nathaniel?
Dialogue||I'm not picky, I like just about anything I can dance to.[]What's with the look? I'm a great dancer, ask any of the soldiers! Except Calvin. He's very, very sarcastic.
Dialogue||I grew up with a dog named Pancake, but we can't have pets in the barracks. But I would love to have a dog again one day!
Dialogue||When did you learn to dance?
Dialogue||What's your best dancing story?
Dialogue||It was on deployment in the far west. There was a fun band playing in a tavern and a pretty woman just dragged me onto my feet.[]She may have stolen my wallet, but I didn't even care because she made me feel like the best dancer in the world!
Dialogue||I love dogs too!
Dialogue||I've never been a dog person.
Dialogue||I knew you would! Dogs are so loyal, they're the perfect companions. We even use them in the military to find lost people, sometimes.
Dialogue||That's a surprise. Dogs are so sweet and fun! How can you not like them?
Dialogue||So many developments in Sun Haven lately! The little city is really getting its groove back, it seems. I'd love to check it out more, if the guards weren't so aggressive!
Dialogue||Why do the guards in Sun Haven hate you so much?
Dialogue||What's the biggest change to Sun Haven you've seen? 
Dialogue||Well they don't have anything against the Elven race in general, they just don't like that I won't "identify myself" in a "proper way", or whatever.[]Maybe I would, if they'd stop shooting at me everytime I fly near! And that guard with the big sword! Who taught her to talk the way she does? Yeesh![]That's the problem with society. Either you follow all their rules, or you're good for nothing. And everyone wonders why I'm always bouncing around from place to place.
Dialogue||Well, that's pretty easy. Your farm is probably the number one thing, but it isn't just that. It's as if the whole town seems busier than it has before, more bustling.[]If Sun Haven was a dwindling breeze before, it's a lively gale now.
Dialogue||Maybe you should just follow the rules.
Dialogue||They shouldn't see you as such a threat.
Dialogue||Ugh, after the way they've been jerks to me? Not a chance.
Dialogue||Right?! That's what I've been trying to tell them! Maybe it's too late now, though. They seem to hate me pretty good, so perhaps I'll never be able to freely enjoy Sun Haven.
Dialogue||It must be interesting, seeing it all happen from above.
Dialogue||I wish I could see the town grow from the sky.
Dialogue||It is. A bird's eye view is usually my preferred way of seeing things, but I'd love to check Sun Haven out from the ground more, though.
Dialogue||It is a sight to be savored, that's for sure. Ah, how unfortunate that everyone can not be as skilled as myself! I'd love to check Sun Haven out from the ground more, though.
Dialogue||There's my farmer! So how much of your farm belongs to me now that we're married?
Dialogue||Um... none of it?
Dialogue||Did you ever see this in your future?
Dialogue||What? Booo. I thought that married people had to share everything they own!
Dialogue||What, falling for the romantic wiles of the Human Town's only farmer? Of course XX, this was always the plan.
Dialogue||You don't need a wedding to get what you want, Xyla.
Dialogue||Then do I own half of all your stuff?
Dialogue||Hey, good point! I always was a "take now, avoid questions later" kind of person.
Dialogue||Huh? No way![]I worked way too hard to get robbed by some bozo with a ring.
Dialogue||Ha ha, your sarcasm is so funny.
Dialogue||Okay, I guess this is a bit of a surprise for us both.
Dialogue||I think so, too! I'm glad we share this completely genuine, mutual appreciation for my humor.
Dialogue||You mean you didn't plan on gretting romantically involved with the Demon King Minos's right hand on the royal council? Or did you just not expect to fall in love with a Demon?[]Either way, don't act like I'm not the most exciting thing that's ever happened to you!
Dialogue||Hey there, XX. How are the, ehm, seeds growing?
Dialogue||What makes you ask about my seeds?
Dialogue||You should start your own garden!
Dialogue||Heh, it was a bad attempt at small talk, I know. We've been talking so much recently, though. I wanted to try asking you something related to farming.[]...But I suddenly realize I know nothing about it, really. I feel guilty, you've talked to me so much about my music. 
Dialogue||I don't think I could do anything like that. What would I even grow? Flowers? Potatoes?
Dialogue||I appreciate the effort.
Dialogue||Yeah, maybe stick to your music from now on.
Dialogue||I've never been the best at making friends, XX. I want to try and change that, though. So thanks for giving me some credit. 
Dialogue||That seems unusually blunt for you, XX. If that's how you feel, then forget it. 
Dialogue||I could show you the ropes sometime.
Dialogue||Maybe gardening isn't for everyone.
Dialogue||An... interesting proposal, but I don't know about that. I like to stick with what I'm comfortable with, but the offer is appreciated. 
Dialogue||This is true. I was never cut out to be a farmer, if that wasn't incredibly obvious.
Dialogue||The most exciting thing about being a witch is seeing what others don't. The energies have been so active lately! It feels like something big is right on the horizon.
Dialogue||Was it hard to learn how to read those energies?
Dialogue||It took a lot of work to get where I am as a witch, but I've never been left feeling like it didn't pay off.[]I wouldn't be the same person without my abilities. You can relate to that, can't you?
Dialogue||I can answer this without reading any energies. I'm very happy with our relationship together, XX.[]When you first moved to town, I felt a special aura about you. I just never expected to be part of it! I'm glad though, because when I think of the future, it's you I see.
Dialogue||Honestly? I can.
Dialogue||Honestly? I'm not sure.
Dialogue||Heh, I knew I didn't even have to ask. You understand completely. 
Dialogue||You really don't know for sure? That's not what I expected to hear. I guess you don't feel the way I do. 
Dialogue||Hopefully you aren't wrong.
Dialogue||I see you in the future, too, Catherine.
Dialogue||Is there a reason you think I'd be wrong, XX...? 
Dialogue||Do you mean that? It's looking like the universe brought us together for a reason!
Dialogue||I'm never too invested in work to pass up a friend. How's it going, XX?																																																																																																																				
Dialogue||XX, have you ever tried painting? I'll teach you how sometime!
Dialogue||You're so talented, Jun. I'm jealous!
Dialogue||You're always teaching. Do you ever get tired of teaching the kids?
Dialogue||It's no big deal, I just find things that relax my mind and practice them. It's the same with meditation.[]Do you have a hobby like that, something that relaxes you?
Dialogue||I'll never get tired of it, especially with the children. Helping them learn how to problem-solve and follow their curiosity makes my days feel meaningful.[]One day I'll be teaching my own kids and watching them grow, and that will be even more meaningful.
Dialogue||For me, it's farming.
Dialogue||You relax me more than anything, Jun.
Dialogue||Of course, I should have guessed that one.
Dialogue||Ah, XX! You're too good at making me blush!
Dialogue||Aw Jun, you're going to be the best dad one day!
Dialogue||I don't know how you can stand being around kids that much.
Dialogue||Thank you, XX. That means a lot, especially coming from you.
Dialogue||I didn't know you had so much trouble with children, XX. That could be a problem one day.
Dialogue||My life in Sun Haven was always warm and sunny, but now it's better than I ever could've imagined. I love you, XX.																																																																																																						
Dialogue||Hey, farmer. You'll need to build some muscle if you're going to tame that land.
Dialogue||Sometimes I remember that you had just crawled out of a sewer when we met. Then I think, "I can't believe I'm with this sewer rat!"
Dialogue||Are you finally having second thoughts?
Dialogue||Eh, no such luck... It's not everyday I find someone who can keep up with me like you do, XX. That's worth something, even if it came from the sewer!
Dialogue||Ugh, you know I hate getting into mushy talk. But since you asked...[]There's a <i>teeny tiny</i> chance that I'm happier than ever before... just a chance![]I've even been thinking that I wouldn't mind staying this happy for the rest of my life, you know. Do you catch my drift, XX? Or is that too subtle for your little rat brain?
Dialogue||It's not my fault there's no good road to Withergate...
Dialogue||You throw that in my face a lot for someone who used to live in a cave.
Dialogue||Are you saying that it's my fault? Well... actually, you're technically right about that. Heck, maybe Withergate could use a reliable road. I'll bring it up to King Minos.
Dialogue||I would choose a cave over a sewer any day. If you disagree, then you're either a sewer rat or... well, Donovan.
Dialogue||Oh, I sure do.
Dialogue||Oh, I sure do... not.
Dialogue||You'd better! My ring finger is feeling pretty light these days.
Dialogue||I would sigh, but the breath would be wasted on you... Let's just say that my ring finger is feeling pretty light these days. Get the picture now?
Dialogue||I know you're busy, but you could use a clean change of clothes.																																																																									
Dialogue||Tactics are important in every fight. Strength alone can't win against a good plan.												 					
Dialogue||You're who's taking that land? Hm. Thought you'd be bigger.
Dialogue||... Thanks? My name's XX.
Dialogue||Pleasure. Call me Solon. If you need some new gear, you come right to me.
Dialogue||Welcome back, outsider. I guess you're sticking around, huh?[]I guess I can't blame you. This city is just too great.
Dialogue||Hey, where did you live before Withergate?
Dialogue||Hey, if you could live anywhere in the world, where would you go?
Dialogue||Before Withergate City was built, there was only the castle. The Demon King took me in after Darius found me living in a cave out in the wilds.[]I didn't really have a home before that and I've got to say... I kind of miss it!
Dialogue||Anywhere, huh? I've heard that the Naga have some real intricate cave systems that include whole cities. I don't know why, but there's just something so comfy about a dark, dripping cave.
Dialogue||So you owe it all to Darius, huh?
Dialogue||Living in a cave is pretty hardcore.
Dialogue||I don't owe anything to anyone, outsider. Darius has my respect and loyalty - even my friendship! - but he doesn't own me.
Dialogue||For once I agree with you! But it flooded when it rained, so I decided to follow Darius back to the castle anyway. Eh, it worked out all right.
Dialogue||A cave sounds awful.
Dialogue||I guess I can see why you'd be comfortable there.
Dialogue||Hey, you asked me the question. What did you expect - a tropical beach? That's not my style.
Dialogue||Caves are safe and private. Honestly, I don't know why more people aren't living in caves!
Dialogue||Hi XX! I'm a little bored. Any ideas, nya?
Dialogue||Do you have any hobbies?
Dialogue||You seem like the kind of cat who'd like dancing!
Dialogue||I try teaching tricks to my pet kittens, but they're too sleepy to learn. Oh, and I loooove sewing and knitting clothes! I especially love yarn, it's so soft and colorful and happy!
Dialogue||Oh yes, but only to the right music. I can't dance to boring music, like what Claude listens to. It has to be energetic, like Kitty!
Dialogue||I'm not so sure cats could use their hands that well.
Dialogue||Looking at your dress, I bet you make really great clothes!
Dialogue||Cats are very good with their hands. Plus, you haven't even seen my stuff I've made, nyan.
Dialogue||Oh yes, even the house cats love them! No you silly, I don't put them in the clothes, they like to lay on top of them! 
Dialogue||What's the right kind of music?
Dialogue||Somehow I think you could dance to anything.
Dialogue||Fast music, for certain. I like a fast beat, nya! That's what gets my paws tapping!
Dialogue||Maybe, maybe. Kitty dances in the grass, sometimes with no music at all!
Dialogue||Keeping a sharp mind and body, XX?
Dialogue||Why do you ask if my body is sharp?
Dialogue||Look, I've always been meaning to ask. How do you do your hair?
Dialogue||Good question. Well, it's my belief that mental and physical health are very closely linked with one another.[]A healthy body is important in order to have a healthy mind and spirit. That's why I tell all my clients to try to eat a good diet and get plenty of sleep.
Dialogue||Catherine developed it for me, using her plants. I had no idea something like Greenroot could be used to make a hair dye! I think my hair really expresses my individuality.
Dialogue||That's a very interesting theory.
Dialogue||Maybe save physiology for Wornhardt.
Dialogue||It is, isn't it. It's important that we be mindful to keep every component of ourselves healthy and strong.
Dialogue||I'm sorry you don't see the importance of a mind-body balance, XX. I hope you do well and feel good, regardless.
Dialogue||But is your hair blue with dark dye, or dark with blue dye? 
Dialogue||You're certainly a unique person, Jun.
Dialogue||Oh, I can't spoil the mystery completely, can I? You'll just have to use your imagination, XX, heh.
Dialogue||Everyone is unique in their own way. Whether it's a hairstyle or a favorite food. In a way, we're all different. That's what makes the world so special, I think.
Dialogue||I'm always looking for a new way to express myself.				
Dialogue||I've been in such a good mood lately. I think I have you to blame!
Dialogue||Have I told you that you're glowing? Because you're glowing.
Dialogue||You're always cheerful, even before we were a couple.
Dialogue||Oh, shut up! You're just saying that because you think you have to.
Dialogue||I guess that's true. Well, mostly. I don't get angry often, but when I do it is <i>not</i> pretty. I hope you never have to see it.
Dialogue||I'm saying it because it's true.
Dialogue||I don't have to, but I like to!
Dialogue||OH! I just realized - I dropped a bag of luminous powder in the back of my shop. That must be why I'm glowing.[]... I still liked the compliment, though.
Dialogue||I bet you're pretty when you're angry, too.
Dialogue||I'm curious now, I want to see it.
Dialogue||That is so not what I meant! You get away with it this time, XX.
Dialogue||Don't even joke, XX. I'm telling you, I don't hold back when I'm mad. Even for you!
Dialogue||My blade has grown ever so dull. I suppose it <i>has</i> been fifty years since I had it sharpened.
Dialogue||Your sword sure does make you look imposing.
Dialogue||It's been fifty years since you sharpened your sword?
Dialogue||You really think so, hm? Of course you do. I am Darius, prince of Withergate! Son of Minos! Might is my right, and my choice in arms reflects that.
Dialogue||This blade is more powerful than most any other. I've cut down foes in full Mithril as if they were wheat to a scythe.[]It rarely needs service, despite how often I might use it.[]It isn't just a weapon, however. It is a symbol of my family's raw strength. What I hold here is my family's legacy.
Dialogue||Isn't it heavy?
Dialogue||I'd like to give it a swing sometime.
Dialogue||For lesser beings, maybe. For me, commanding this blade is second nature.
Dialogue||You have bold desires, XX. But this blade belongs solely to me. Besides, I doubt you could even lift it from the ground, let alone swing it.[]This is a blade meant for a wielder who is of, shall we say... a higher caliber.
Dialogue||I suppose such a powerful blade suits you.
Dialogue||You'd better take care of it quickly.
Dialogue||You are right, XX. I have to keep myself in perfect condition, especially my weaponry. My reputation must always precede me, after all.[]I'll have Xyla deal with it. 
Dialogue||Watch how you speak, XX. We are friends, but I am still the prince. You don't give the commands, <i>I do</i>.
Dialogue||I like to think I'm changing people's lives by changing their look. You should really give me a shot!
Dialogue||What got you into the salon business?
Dialogue||When you say I should "really" give you a shot...
Dialogue||I used to cut my whole family's hair. It's the only skill I have other than archery, but that doesn't make much money.
Dialogue||Oops, there goes my mouth again. I don't mean it like an insult. But it's never a bad time to update your look, you know.
Dialogue||Archery? That's impressive!
Dialogue||Why do you like archery?
Dialogue||Thanks! I practice all the time so I can join the army. I figure joining the army as an archer is my best bet to travel the world for free!
Dialogue||I practice all the time so I can join the army. I figure joining the army as an archer is my best bet to travel the world for free!
Dialogue||I don't care what you think about my look.
Dialogue||I like that you're up front about it.
Dialogue||Okay, sheesh. I was just offering to help. Thin skin, huh?
Dialogue||Some people call me blunt, but I think I'm just honest. I'm glad you can take it.
Dialogue||I might not be great with a sword, but that doesn't mean I can't contribute!											
Dialogue||Don't you just love the open ocean? Breathing in that salty air... it gives me life!
Dialogue||I still can't believe someone like you would marry someone like me... Obviously I'm happy about it!																																																																																			
Dialogue||Maybe the "long white coat" look is going out of style...																											
Dialogue||Oh, hello farmer. Good to see you out.
Dialogue||I haven't seen you in town much.
Dialogue||Pod seems like a handful.
Dialogue||I don't go out a lot. Most days I just don't have the energy for an outing, especially after playing with Pod in the morning.
Dialogue||He can be, but I like to see him living life his way. If he gets into a little trouble every now and then - so what? At least he's happy.
Dialogue||Are you okay?
Dialogue||Why are you so tired?
Dialogue||Oh yes, thank you. I have a heart condition that gives me fatigue, but it's under control. Doctor Wornhardt and Catherine have both done wonders for me.
Dialogue||I have a heart condition that gives me fatigue, but it's under control. Doctor Wornhardt and Catherine have both done wonders for me!
Dialogue||All that matters is that he's happy and safe.
Dialogue||That doesn't seem very responsible.
Dialogue||I couldn't agree more.
Dialogue||Thanks for the parenting advice, farmer! But I'll raise my son how I like.
Dialogue||XX, I just realized I never ask you about your farm. I feel like such a jerk! I hope it's going well for you.
Dialogue||I enjoyed our last date!
Dialogue||Liam, did you ever go to visit Elios?
Dialogue||Oh, me too! It was nice getting my mind off everyday things.
Dialogue||I did, not long after moving here. Roza escorted me up the mountain with Emma and Elizabeth.[]At first I was scared of the monsters, but then I saw Roza in action. She's scarier than any monster up there, that's for sure.[]Elios didn't bless me, but he did say he saw promise in the girls. We're supposed to visit him again in five years and I really don't know what to make of that.
Dialogue||Maybe I could take your mind off things again? Let's go on another date!
Dialogue||It was fun, but we should just be friends.
Dialogue||Really? I mean, sure! I'd really like that. I'm pretty busy with the girls though. Would you mind a night in at my house? If that's fine, then come by tomorrow night at 5:00 pm.
Dialogue||Oh. I mean, yeah. I was just going to say, uh, the same thing. Yep.
Dialogue||It was dangerous for you to bring your sisters.
Dialogue||I'm glad Elios welcomed you. It's nice having you here.
Dialogue||Roza really had everything under control. I wouldn't purposely put my sisters in danger, you know.
Dialogue||Oh, yeah? Heh, I'm glad too. New places aren't always so welcoming. Moving to new towns in the north, it can be weeks before you even learn someone's name.
Dialogue||Is it just me, or do the guards here look like ninnies?						
Dialogue||XX! I'm glad to see you. I had a... rough morning.
Dialogue||How do you usually wind down from a rough day?
Dialogue||I got caught in Sun Haven earlier this morning - apparently the guards are on high alert.[]That guard with the really big sword was NOT happy to see me sitting on top of the town hall.
Dialogue||I love to snack on some greenroot, for starters. Then I usually just escape on my own into the trees. There's nowhere as peaceful as a quiet branch in the middle of the forest.
Dialogue||Did you get hurt?
Dialogue||You let yourself get caught?
Dialogue||No, I'm fine. Arrows are easy to dodge when you're above them. Thank you for worrying, though.[]I guess I need to be a little more discreet when I visit your town, huh?
Dialogue||It's not that simple. That guard has eyes like a hawk. I swear, nobody else has ever seen me until her. I don't think I'm to blame here.
Dialogue||Do you always deal with your feelings alone?
Dialogue||You can spend time with me, if you need a friend.
Dialogue||I've never thought much about it. But yes, I often seek solitude when I need to process my thoughts. It's how I've always been.
Dialogue||That's... very sweet, XX. I usually seek solitude when I need to process my thoughts. It's nothing against you, it's just how I've always been. But I'm glad to know you're here.
Dialogue||I'm feeling good about Sun Haven. Actually, I'm feeling good about everything!																																												
Dialogue||Hey farmer! Moooooo.
Dialogue||What are you staring at? Haven't seen a classy lady like me before?
Dialogue||People always tell me I'm so high up in the clouds. Sometimes I feel that they're right.				
Dialogue||I'll be glad to help you as soon as you actually find a book to read.
Dialogue||Don't worry, I'm always on guard.																								
Dialogue||Allie tells me I train too much.						 					
Dialogue||Keep your head up, maybe you'll see me again soon.
Dialogue||Elizabeth is my sister!							
Dialogue||A monster attack from Withergate? They wouldn't stand a chance!
Dialogue||XX, look! See that cloud? That’s a sign of good fortune to come! … Or a sign of personal injury. Hang on, I need to check my aeromancy booklet.																	
Dialogue||Eh, you again? What's the problem?
Dialogue||You're sure in a bad mood all the time.
Dialogue||So, those snakes on your head...
Dialogue||Gee, thanks. It's talk like that what really lifts my spirits. I've turned over a new leaf thanks to you, kid. Now if you don't mind, I've got some charity work to do with my newfound perspective.
Dialogue||What about 'em? You do know these are attached to my head, right? I'm not just wearin' a wig made of snakes here.
Dialogue||You don't have to be so sarcastic.
Dialogue||You're pretty funny!
Dialogue||Actually, I do. It's my defense mechanism. In other words, it's how I get rid of annoyin' kids like yourself.
Dialogue||You think that's funny? Ah, sheesh... Can't you tell I'm tryin' to get rid of you? Well at least one of us is havin' a good time.
Dialogue||Oh - of course, I totally knew that.
Dialogue||I'm sorry, I had no idea they were part of your head.
Dialogue||Look, if you're goin' to tell a lie then you gotta at least put some effort into it. Sheesh, what a joke.
Dialogue||Live and learn, I guess. Don't make 'em upset by staring at 'em too long. It's annoying when they slither around too much. Makes my head itch.
Dialogue||I feel like a tree in Spring - everything is fresh and new! I look forward to my life with you, XX.
Dialogue||You know I never mentioned it before, but your tattoos are beautiful.
Dialogue||What do you imagine when you think of our future?
Dialogue||All this time and you're only now commenting on them? I mean, thank you and all, but where did that come from?
Dialogue||Hm... Well for one, I see a lot of plants! My enchanting could really bring your farm to the next level, you know.[]Otherwise, I'm trying not to overthink our relationship, XX. I like to take things as they come.
Dialogue||Maybe it's just the light, but I swear you're glowing!
Dialogue||I'm just saying, your tattoos suit you elegantly.
Dialogue||Okay, weirdo! Haha, I'm just kidding, XX. Mostly.[]You know, we give our people these tattoos at a very young age. They're supposed to be a representation of our spirit. At least, I think that's right. You might have to check that with the Elder.
Dialogue||Maybe we aren't on the same page after all.
Dialogue||I love that you stay in the present moment.
Dialogue||Well I can't know what you're thinking all the time, XX.
Dialogue||That's another of Nivara's teachings, actually. "The only time is now" or something along those lines. I really took it to heart, actually.
Dialogue||Keep your head up, XX.
Dialogue||You must be the new farmer I've heard about. Welcome to our tavern! 
Dialogue||Hello, my name is XX.
Dialogue||And I'm Ronald. Let me know if you're craving anything to eat or drink, you hear?
Dialogue||I caught a huge fish last night! It was too beautiful to keep, so I let it go.[]... Okay, it broke my line.
Dialogue||That's unlucky. You'll get it next time.
Dialogue||Not with my lines, but this was one tough customer. I fought it for a full hour!
Dialogue||That's the right attitude. A fisherman's best tool is patience. I learned that from an old fish-trapper while I was waiting out a storm in the east.[]Can you believe they do all their fishing with traps over there? It's true, no lines or nets!
Dialogue||It sounds like your gear failed you.
Dialogue||Some fish are really amazing.
Dialogue||My equipment is top-notch, buddy. You think you can make a stronger line? Be my guest.
Dialogue||No kidding! This isn't a loss for me though - it's a challenge. One day, I'll catch that fish.
Dialogue||Do you use traps?
Dialogue||Do traps work better than rods?
Dialogue||Nah, I prefer the struggle between fish and man. The instant you get a bite on the hook is a special experience. For a split-second, nothing else in the world matters.
Dialogue||Maybe for small fish, but I'm always after the big fish. You strike me as a big fish kind of person, too!
Dialogue||The kids started calling me "Uncle Jun" today. They're so cute!																																																																																																							
Dialogue||How does being married to the Archmage of Sun Haven feel? Hopefully it feels as good as being married to the farmer of Sun Haven!																																											
Dialogue||Hey XX, I'm happy to see you.[]I've actually been meaning to ask you... I was thinking we could go visit your farm together. What do you think?
Dialogue||I didn't know you liked my farm so much.
Dialogue||What if we had a date right here in Nel'Vari?
Dialogue||Didn't I mention before that it's beautiful? You've really done well with it.[]I used to sit on a hill nearby to think about all the future possibilities. I know it sounds a little vague, but I guess it's like... reflecting on the future, if that makes sense?
Dialogue||Oh! A - a date? You really mean it? That... that would be fine with me, XX!
Dialogue||What do you reflect on?
Dialogue||I don't quite understand.
Dialogue||I reflect on lots of things. Simply put, the things I'll do, and the things I won't do. I'm captivated by the idea of having opportunities.[]It's the idea that I can pick and choose from any future - just reach out and grab it if I want to. Knowing I have this capability feels almost more powerful than my wind magic.
Dialogue||It's the idea that I can pick and choose from any future - just reach out and grab it if I want to. Knowing I have this capability feels almost more powerful than my wind magic.
Dialogue||Actually, I'm having second thoughts.
Dialogue||Of course I meant it! When should we go?
Dialogue||That's okay. I guess I can wait. But I won't wait forever, XX.
Dialogue||Meet me outside of my house and we'll go together. Let's say, tomorrow at 12:00 pm. I already can't wait!
Dialogue||Happy day, XX!
Dialogue||Did you know that your face is way too easy to make fun of? I thought you should hear it from someone who loves you!																			
Dialogue||I'm pretty busy today, but I'll be thinking of you the whole way through.									
Dialogue||Hmph. That's odd, could I seriously have miscounted?
Dialogue||I'm shocked you made a mistake in your counting!
Dialogue||So what's the problem?
Dialogue||Hey, no one's perfect. My income does rely on being precise, however...
Dialogue||It seems I accidentally ordered too much iron ore. I had a contract to supply Rex, but now I've got extra...
Dialogue||I'm sure you'll find it again, and then it's like a bonus!
Dialogue||So work double-time and make up the loss!
Dialogue||Heh. XX, I like the way you think. I'd prefer to have it now, but I suppose that's just life sometimes.
Dialogue||That's a good idea. Glad I thought of it first! I'm already calculating how to make up this little mishap. More importantly, though, is how to ensure it doesn't happen again. 
Dialogue||So what? Just give him the extra ore as a gift.
Dialogue||Maybe Solon would buy it?
Dialogue||I... I... I don't know what to say... That is genuinely a terrible suggestion, XX![]I'm trying to run a business. If Rex wants the extra ore, Rex can pay for it.
Dialogue||Silly XX, trying to play merchant like me.[]Solon is only interested in refined bars, though perhaps if I had someone to turn the ores into bars for me then I could make my money back.
Dialogue||Hey there, sweetie. How does it feel to be the other half of Sun Haven's number one couple?
Dialogue||I didn't realize we were ranked!
Dialogue||Does being married change your plans at all?
Dialogue||Sure we are! Look at everything we get done on our own - we practically run this town apart, so think of what we can do now that we're together! This is the start of a venture like no other!
Dialogue||I guess it isn't a whole lot different than before. But with you on my side, there's no end to what I could accomplish!![]Well, what <i>we</i> could accomplish, I mean. Sorry, my head is racing right now with possibilities.
Dialogue||All right, I'm on board!
Dialogue||All right, don't get ahead of yourself.
Dialogue||Of course you are XX, this is a lifelong commitment after all. I can already see our success building right in front of us...
Dialogue||Sorry XX, my momentum only ever increases. Better get ready, because you're in this with me, now!
Dialogue||What kind of possibilities?
Dialogue||I'm glad to be your inspiration!
Dialogue||The most obvious one is, I could sell your produce on my cart. Heck, I could even cart it to nearby villages and charge extra!
Dialogue||Two great people are going to have that affect when you put them together, aren't they? 
Dialogue||Thanks for saying hi, hun. You sure you're not just doing that to stay on my good side? Either way, it's working!
Dialogue||Ah, my trusted companion. I'm always glad to see you, XX. You distract me from my daily troubles.
Dialogue||I feel close to you too, Darius.
Dialogue||You make me feel invincible.
Dialogue||Then we should go out again. Surely, your answer must be yes?
Dialogue||I have something for you, XX. It won't make you invincible, but it's as close as you can get. My family's enchanted heirloom.[]This royal heirloom will make you undefeatable. Will you take it as a gift from me?
Dialogue||I'm afraid not, Darius.
Dialogue||I would love to, Darius!
Dialogue||I see. Not just anyone can reject the prince of Demons. You're truly something special, XX.
Dialogue||Fantastic! Meet me outside of the apartment building tomorrow at 5:00 pm.
Dialogue||Of course, I accept!
Dialogue||Are you sure?
Dialogue||I know this heirloom is destined for you. Take it, keep it proudly and let its strength flow through you.
Dialogue||I know this heirloom is destined for you. Take it, keep it proudly and let its strength flow through you. 
Dialogue||We should spar one day!																																																																													
Dialogue||XX, be honest... Does my face look more square today? I've been trying to exercise my jaw.
Dialogue||I think it's working! I think.
Dialogue||I had fun on our date the other day. I was thinking we could do it again!
Dialogue||Oh I almost forgot - XX, close your eyes! I have something for you.
Dialogue||I did too. Talking to you is easy for some reason. It's not often I get to speak so freely. I'd love to go out with you another time!
Dialogue||Okay, my eyes are closed.
Dialogue||No way, just give it to me!
Dialogue||All right, here. This is my helmet. It was crafted specially for me when I first joined the military.[]XX, this helmet saved my head more than once. I want it to protect you now. Go on, have it!
Dialogue||Great, let's do it!
Dialogue||It should probably be a one-time thing.
Dialogue||Meet me at the barracks tomorrow at 5:00 pm. I'm looking forward to it!
Dialogue||Do you think so? If that's what you want, I'll respect your wishes. 
Dialogue||Living here is a lot easier now that I have someone I can really count on... Oh, of course I'm talking about you!																																																																																																							
Dialogue||Hello, you must be the one who bought the old farm. I'm Liam, it's good to meet you.
Dialogue||Pleasure to meet you, Liam. I'm XX.
Dialogue||Likewise. About the pleasure, not about the name. My name's Liam. But, I already told you that. Sorry.
Dialogue||Ever since we started dating, the soldiers have been whispering and giving me funny looks. I don't get it!
Dialogue||They must be curious about us.
Dialogue||Are you worried this will affect your authority with them?
Dialogue||Lester and Allison, maybe. But Calvin? I can't imagine he cares one bit.
Dialogue||Oh, no. If anything, they will make some jokes behind my back and forget about it. I've been their captain too long for them to see me as anything else.
Dialogue||Be honest - do you like the attention?
Dialogue||Does it bother you that they talk about us?
Dialogue||I've never cared to be the center of attention, not unless I'm addressing my soldiers. But I guess there's something kind of fun about it!
Dialogue||The way you maintain your authority is always impressive.
Dialogue||I wouldn't be so sure.
Dialogue||Heh, you think so? Well thanks, XX.[]Somehow you always find a way to boost me up, even when I don't think I need it.
Dialogue||You don't know them like I do, XX.
Dialogue||I try to keep my spirits up. Positivity is contagious!			 					
Dialogue||No thanks, I'm not feeling too chatty right now.
Dialogue||I hope you don't think it's boring that I'm just a baker.									
Dialogue||There's a reflection of me in your eye... it's perfect.																																						
Dialogue||It's not bad, making honest money.										
Dialogue||Everything seems so golden and new to me. I have you to thank for that. 																																																										
Dialogue||Do you believe in love at first sight?							
Dialogue||Don't worry about acting proper just because you're dating the Archmage. I like you best when you're relaxed.																	
Dialogue||Hello again! Spare time for a chat?
Dialogue||Have you been to the caves around here?
Dialogue||What do you do when you're not underground?
Dialogue||Oh, of course. They're fantastic, full of useful ore and beautiful rock formations.[]I haven't had the chance to get all the way through them, but that's my first goal before I move on to the next town.
Dialogue||For fun, I like to relax in whatever tavern is nearest. Taverns, pubs, watering holes - these places keep me from getting lonely on the road.
Dialogue||All the way to the bottom? Is that possible?
Dialogue||You take this really seriously!
Dialogue||Of course! I like to say, anything is possible with perseverance and rations. It helps me remember to pack enough food.
Dialogue||Of course! I can't claim to be the best miner in the world without conquering every mine. For now I just say I'm "almost" the best miner in the world, but that doesn't sound as impressive.
Dialogue||You're a nice guy. I bet you make lots of friends!
Dialogue||Nobody makes real friends in a tavern.
Dialogue||That's mighty nice of you to say! Sometimes it's less about making friends and just about being around people.[]Too much time underground and sometimes I forget there's a whole world up here!
Dialogue||Maybe not with that attitude.[]Even if they're just your pal for a night, it's nice to make conversation - even with strangers.
Dialogue||Fireballs and lightning bolts are clever, but books are the only magic I need.														
Dialogue||Having a good day, I hope?									 					
Dialogue||Hey there, XX. Care to talk for a moment? I'm taking a break from the enchanting table.
Dialogue||With all of your enchanting, when do you find time for woodworking?
Dialogue||Is your brooch enchanted, too?
Dialogue||It's tough, I'll admit. I don't practice my crafting as much as I should.[]Maybe it's because my work as an enchantress is for the good of everyone, but my crafting is just for me. 
Dialogue||This old thing? Heh, not at all. It was given to me by the Elven Elder.[]Most Elves get something like this from the Elder when they pick a profession. I just wear it because it's nice.
Dialogue||Your happiness is important, Iris. If crafting makes you happy, then do it!
Dialogue||It's important to consider your people's needs above your own.
Dialogue||It really does make me happy. Maybe I really should spend more time on my woodworking. Thanks, XX, I'll think about it!
Dialogue||You really think so? Hm. You might be right. Maybe I should talk to the Elder about this...
Dialogue||That's a lovely tradition - the Elder chose well!
Dialogue||That sounds so formal. Is it a big deal?
Dialogue||You think so? I didn't love it at first, but it grew on me. Literally - I made it grow into my clothing so I don't have to worry about it coming loose.
Dialogue||I don't think so, but then again I'm not very strict about tradition. I mean, our culture is important and all, but I would never reject someone for not wearing a pin.
Dialogue||Sometimes I see Roza's sword and think I should get an upgrade... What do you think, XX?
Dialogue||You shouldn't compare.
Dialogue||Why does she have such a big sword anyway?
Dialogue||Heh, you almost sound like my mother. You're right, anyway. Her sword is just so <i>big</i>.
Dialogue||In battle, she uses her sword as a shield in a tight spot. I've seen it in action, Roza switches between offense and defense in the blink of an eye.[]It's a big part of why I made her my second-in-command. Not just because she's tough, but because she's smart.
Dialogue||Your sword is a little dinky.
Dialogue||You know that doesn't matter.
Dialogue||I knew it... the soldiers must have been laughing at me this whole time.
Dialogue||You're right, you're right. A sword is only as sharp as the soldier that holds it.
Dialogue||Have you ever sparred with her? 
Dialogue||That's a ridiculous strategy.
Dialogue||Heh, actually I haven't. And I don't plan to! There's no point in making me look bad in front of the soldiers.
Dialogue||You say that, but you haven't seen her in battle. Trust me XX, she knows what she's doing.
Dialogue||Now that we're married, my reputation here is basically ruined.																															
Dialogue||Sometimes I get bored at home, but it's easy to relax around you. XX, you're like magic!
Dialogue||It's funny - I can never tell when you're relaxed.
Dialogue||Kitty, are you happy in our relationship?
Dialogue||That's because I'm still a kitten at heart, nya nya. Even when I'm relaxing, I am ready to pounce!
Dialogue||Wha? Of course Kitty is happy! I'm always so joyful around you, XX.[]In fact... I have been thinking a looot about the next step for us! Do you know what Kitty is talking about, XX?[]Kitty will give you a hint - I'm ready to be with you <i>forever!</i>
Dialogue||That's what makes you fun!
Dialogue||I want to be more like you, Kitty - I want to have more fun!
Dialogue||I think so too, even if some people say I need to grow up. I only want to be my natural self!
Dialogue||It's a good thing we're dating, nya! We can always have fun together!
Dialogue||I don't understand.
Dialogue||I think I understand!
Dialogue||Oh nyan... Maybe this isn't the right time after all.
Dialogue||Good good! It's the perfect time, XX. I'm ready and very very excited!
Dialogue||What do you think about the barracks? Pretty cool, right?
Dialogue||You again? What, are you bored of Sun Haven?[]Oh, you actually want to talk. This should be good!
Dialogue||Wait, how do you know I'm from Sun Haven?
Dialogue||Who even are you?
Dialogue||Unlike your Human town, we keep our eyes and ears open around here. You should take a page out of our book and get some real security.
Dialogue||I'm Xyla, and that's the only time I'll tell you my name so don't bother asking again. I'm surprised a sewer rat like you made it to Withergate on your own.
Dialogue||Have you been spying on Sun Haven?
Dialogue||Sun Haven has security...
Dialogue||Well <i>I</i> haven't been spying...[]Don't get so worked up, it's barely spying. Besides, it's just a precaution. You do know what precaution is, don't you?
Dialogue||Those guards may as well be sleep walking. Matter of fact, I've actually seen one sleeping on duty before! If you ask me, your Human armies are just adorable.
Dialogue||That's not very nice.
Dialogue||I'm surprised a rude monster like you has any place in this town.
Dialogue||Oops, didn't mean to hurt your feelings, sewer rat. Don't go springing a leak now.
Dialogue||Oh, you've got teeth? That's good, I like that! Sometimes you have to bite to get by in these parts.
Dialogue||You've grown so much stronger since you arrived. It's a relief knowing that you can handle yourself if you have to.																																																											
Dialogue||My name means "king." I don't think a lot of kings spend their time in the mines, though.						
Dialogue||You make Sun Haven feel more like home than ever before. I didn't think that was a possibility!
Dialogue||Do you think people will talk about you, marrying a farmer?
Dialogue||You seem more relaxed these days.
Dialogue||I should think not. Regardless, it doesn't matter one bit - people can talk all they want, but their words don't have to mean a thing to us.
Dialogue||I'm sure I know why that is - don't act coy, clearly I'm talking about you, XX![]I have more balance between work and my personal life than I ever have before. I'm surprised at how much of a relief I feel, to be honest.
Dialogue||I don't know, I wouldn't want to hurt your career.
Dialogue||You're right, it's none of their business
Dialogue||My career is mine alone to worry about. Focus on your own problems, XX.
Dialogue||I would prefer to worry about ourselves and forget about others when we're together.
Dialogue||You're not worried that you're working less because of me? 
Dialogue||It's delightful to see you smiling so much.
Dialogue||Not one bit! Even if I am working slightly less, it actually feels like I'm thinking more clearly. I would even say I'm getting more work done than I was before.
Dialogue||XX, for that I have you to thank. My inner fire is burning brighter than ever with your love.
Dialogue||Hey XX, are you liking Nel'Vari? I hope you are.
Dialogue||It's gorgeous here.
Dialogue||Have you been to visit Nivara?
Dialogue||You think so, too? I'm glad. You really do deserve to be here. After all, not just anyone can solve our puzzle and gain entry.
Dialogue||Of course I have. When Elves come of age, they go to receive her blessing. For me, her blessing revealed my abilities with wind magic, for which I'm endlessly grateful.
Dialogue||The puzzle was easy, you should increase your security.
Dialogue||Thank you for being so welcoming to me, Vaan.
Dialogue||The puzzle was designed by the Elder. It isn't meant to be impossible, only selective.
Dialogue||Of course. You being here only adds to Nel'Vari's charm. Really, I mean that.
Dialogue||Do you think Nivara will give me a blessing?
Dialogue||So Nivara's blessing gave you your magic, just like Elios.
Dialogue||I'm sure I don't know. Nivara will make that judgement when she meets you.[]Just be yourself, XX, and Nivara will see you the same way that I do... I'm certain you will be found worthy.
Dialogue||You're mistaken. A dragon's blessing doesn't give you magic. The blessing reveals your true self.
Dialogue||Hey, XX! Running into you during the day is always a treat.									
Dialogue||You should stop by more often. A friendly face is perfect for clearing my head.																																																																																																																																														
Dialogue||Giuseppe is such a softie. I love it!																																																																																																																																																																		
Dialogue||Don't start hanging around me all the time just because we're dating. I still have an image to maintain.																						
Dialogue||Oh, hi there! Welcome in, my name is Heather. 
Dialogue||Hi Heather, I'm XX.
Dialogue||Good to meet you. Say, are you the XX that funded the café renovation? You're the reason I have a job! Thank you.
Dialogue||I don't have a lot of close friends in Withergate. Most people scare too easily.																															
Dialogue||I never thought I would find somebody to marry this early in my life. I'm happy it turned out this way!																										
Dialogue||Keep your chin up, XX - it's going to be a good day.
Dialogue||Are you single, Nathaniel?
Dialogue||Nathaniel, are you busy tomorrow? I think we should go out together!
Dialogue||Sure am! Hm, maybe I shouldn't say that so excitedly.[]Er, yes. Currently.
Dialogue||I'm busy every day, but I can make time for a friend. What did you have in mind?
Dialogue||I figured you would be.
Dialogue||I'm sure you have an admirer or two in town.
Dialogue||Oh. Am I... that bad?
Dialogue||Well, I wouldn't know about that... I just try to be friendly, is all.
Dialogue||Let's go on a proper date.
Dialogue||Actually, nevermind.
Dialogue||Oh! Absolutely, that sounds like fun![]You can meet me at the barracks at 12:00 pm and we'll go from there.
Dialogue||Oh? Okay, well come find me if you need anything else.
Dialogue||My home is in the forest across the river. The land there is covered in flowers and berry bushes!																
Dialogue||All these Withergate rumors... they're not what Sun Haven needs right now.							
Dialogue||There's nothing like the thrill of entering a cavern for the first time.																																															
Dialogue||I spoke with Nivara today. It was the first time in a long while.
Dialogue||You haven't been speaking to her as much? 
Dialogue||What did you talk about?
Dialogue||No, I haven't. I actually didn't realize how long it's been since our last conversation. Do you think that's a bad thing?
Dialogue||She said that my spirit feels stronger than the last time we met. Before I could even respond to that, she said she could feel an abundance of love in my energy.[]According to Nivara, knowing love is crucial to spiritual freedom. I'm still exploring that idea.
Dialogue||Isn't that like skipping school?
Dialogue||Don't you think she still has much to teach?
Dialogue||She certainly has a few lessons left for me, probably more than I realize. You're right, XX. I'll make a better effort to see her more often.
Dialogue||Let me know if you need any help testing that idea!
Dialogue||Do you really think she could sense that?
Dialogue||Heh, oh XX. I'm already getting all the "help" I need from you.[]I should thank you, actually. I didn't realize it, but you've accelerated my spiritual growth here. And just by being yourself! You're truly remarkable, XX.
Dialogue||Of course, XX. It's not our place to doubt the guardian dragons, especially not Nivara. I'm sure you wouldn't cast doubt on Elios.
Dialogue||Ah, XX... You make my heart beat so so strong!																																																																																		
Dialogue||I was never sure what to expect from marriage, but this is more ideal than I ever could have imagined.																																																																								
Dialogue||When you walk up to me, my heart starts beating fast. But for a totally different reason than with everyone else.																																											
Dialogue||I've got a bad blister on my hand. I should hire some muscle to move my crates around for me.																		
Dialogue||I don't care what kind of work I do. It's nice just having a roof over my head.										
Dialogue||Is there anything you need? I want to be sure you're completely taken care of.
Dialogue||You don't need to worry about me.
Dialogue||I can't help it, it's my job! You might as well ask a bird not to fly or sing.[]I'll always be looking after you, XX.
Dialogue||Of course I am, XX. Aren't you, or is something wrong? 
Dialogue||I wouldn't have it any other way.
Dialogue||We'll look after each other, Jun.
Dialogue||Heh, that's so like you. You always let me be myself.
Dialogue||Heh, that's so like you. Only you would think to take care of the counselor.
Dialogue||I have doubts.
Dialogue||I'm just thinking about our future together.
Dialogue||Well, at least we're talking about it. Addressing the problem is always the first step. I'm willing to work through this if you are, XX.
Dialogue||Oh... XX, if you're saying what I think you're saying then you should know that I've already thought about this a lot.[]I'm not afraid of commitment, and the idea of being with you for the rest of my life is... a dream!
Dialogue||Hi... sweetie! I had some free time today and spent it in the library. It was so nice and quiet.
Dialogue||Oh, are we using pet names, "sweetie?"
Dialogue||What books do you like to read?
Dialogue||We don't have to! I think it's cute, is all. I'll stop if you think it's dumb.
Dialogue||These days all I have time for is texts on metallurgical techniques. Sorry, I mean books on smithing. But before I was an apprentice, I could lose myself in a good mystery novel.
Dialogue||Yeah, I'd rather not do that.
Dialogue||It is cute... pumpkin!
Dialogue||Oh, okay. I guess I'll just stick with XX.
Dialogue||Oh, good! I wasn't sure what you'd think. Like usual, we're on the same page. Everything is easy with you, XX.
Dialogue||Why do you like mystery novels?
Dialogue||Mysteries are fun - I love the big reveals at the end.
Dialogue||I love the sidekicks. A sidekick always saves the main character's life at some point. Without the strong little sidekicks, the mysteries would never get solved.
Dialogue||You and I are a perfect balance, XX.																																																																
Dialogue||I'll keep the birds from eating your crops, XX. That's a Kitty promise!																																																																	
Dialogue||What's the Human town like, anyway? Boring, right? Yeah, I figured.																							
Dialogue||You know, I think it's ridiculous that you got the apartment right next to mine.
Dialogue||Why is that ridiculous?
Dialogue||I didn't ask for that exact apartment.
Dialogue||Because the top floor is <i>supposed</i> to be for high-profile tenants only. I'm part of the royal council, so it makes sense that I'm there.[]But you? You were just the only person looking for a room!
Dialogue||Sure, sure, pass the blame. Classy move. You better stay nice and quiet, got it? I don't need any trouble from next door.
Dialogue||So go complain about it.
Dialogue||Feel free to sleep on the roof, then!
Dialogue||You need to check your attitude, sewer rat. Besides, Flemmett doesn't take complaints.
Dialogue||Oh, I see how it is! You think you've earned that apartment, huh? Well then I vow to be the <i>worst</i> next door neighbor possible. Just for you!
Dialogue||I won't give you any trouble.
Dialogue||Well now I kind of want to give you some trouble...
Dialogue||Good! Because I don't respond well to annoying neighbors. Why do you think your apartment was empty in the first place?
Dialogue||Trust me XX, that's not what you want. I don't respond well to annoying neighbors. Why do you think your apartment was empty in the first place?
Dialogue||One of the gem cutters just got done carving a stunningly beautiful sapphire this morning. Its fresh edges caught the sunlight so fantastically!
Dialogue||I thought your passion was enchanting.
Dialogue||Lots of people in Sun Haven love gemstones too.
Dialogue||Of course I love the work that I do as an enchanter, it's what I've put my life towards mastering.[]But I still can't resist a big, beautiful gemstone. Even if I don't appreciate them as a functional thing, they're just so pretty. That's worth something on its own, I think.
Dialogue||Oh really? So a love for shining gemstones isn't unique to Nel'Vari. Funny how the things that bridge different people together seem to be the most simple.[]No advanced words or traditions... just shiny gemstones.
Dialogue||I had no idea you appreciated rocks so much.
Dialogue||Why don't you try using gemstones in your work?
Dialogue||Gemstones aren't rocks! Well, okay, they are. But they're beautiful products of the earth, whether freshly hewn from the mine or cut into a splendid shape.
Dialogue||They're two totally separate interests, XX. Gemstones are just pretty to look at or hold. I don't feel any need to try using them in my enchanting.
Dialogue||Looks like people really aren't all that different.
Dialogue||I don't think mutual interest in gemstones matters very much.
Dialogue||I guess we really aren't. Now I'm wondering what else Nel'Vari has in common with Sun Haven!
Dialogue||You need to try and see the bigger picture. It's not about the gemstones themselves, it's about similar interests connecting different people. Just forget about it, actually.
Dialogue||I've never been the best at courtship. If only it were more like sword fighting.																									
Dialogue||There's nothing like the smell of ever-blooming flowers in the air. I even got some woodworking in this morning! It's a nearly-perfect day, XX.
Dialogue||Is that why you look so giddy? 
Dialogue||Hey, what would be a completely perfect day for you?
Dialogue||Actually... I wanted to get you something. It's a surprise! Think of it as a thank-you for our date. But before I give it to you, you have to promise to keep it safe.
Dialogue||A perfect day... I don't know about the whole day, but it would for sure start with sleeping in.
Dialogue||I promise!
Dialogue||I'm dying to know what the surprise is!
Dialogue||This totem is for you, XX. I carved it by hand. It carries a strong enchantment that should help you manage your magic. Please carry it with you - I worked hard to make it. 
Dialogue||This totem is for you, XX. I carved it by hand. It carries a strong enchantment that should help you manage your magic. Please carry it with you - I worked hard to make it.
Dialogue||I can't believe you would waste your day by sleeping in!
Dialogue||Sleeping in, that sounds perfect!
Dialogue||Sorry to break it to you, XX, but I am NOT an early bird unless I have to be. I sleep in when I get the chance, but I always wake up on the right side of the bed.
Dialogue||I sleep in when I get the chance, but I always wake up on the right side of the bed.
Dialogue||I hope you're staying out of trouble - it would look bad if I was dating a criminal!
Dialogue||You mean you wouldn't cover for me?
Dialogue||Have you ever gotten into serious trouble before?
Dialogue||Luckily, it won't come to that because you're a good citizen who doesn't commit crimes. Right?
Dialogue||The most trouble I ever got into was as a kid. I stole a toy slingshot by hiding it in my pants.[]I didn't even make it out of the store before they caught me. The sling was still hanging out the back of my pants. I guess I wasn't cut out to be a criminal.
Dialogue||Riiiight...
Dialogue||Right!
Dialogue||I hope you're only joking because I really don't want to turn you in. For the record, I would if I had to.
Dialogue||I thought so! I really don't want to turn you in for a crime, XX.
Dialogue||What happened to you?
Dialogue||Did you feel guilty?
Dialogue||I felt terrible after getting caught. My mom didn't yell at me or anything, but she was completely disappointed. In a way, that was much worse than being yelled at.[]And of course, she grounded me for a month.
Dialogue||If you're wasting my time, you're wasting my money.
Dialogue||There's a lot that I like about this town, especially the people. Everyone's a good neighbor here - including you, XX!
Dialogue||Who do you spend the most time with in Sun Haven?
Dialogue||What's your favorite thing about Sun Haven?
Dialogue||You're asking who I'm friends with? Well, the soldiers are my family. But other than them...[]Dr. Wornhardt has a good head. Kitty is always a riot. Lucia, of course. Solon is a real man's man. Then you've got Peter, Judith and Albert... You know, I think I get along with just about everyone in this town!
Dialogue||I would say it's the weather, hands down. I've been stationed in some terrible weather before, so I'm really enjoying the sunshine here.
Dialogue||If anyone could make friends with everyone, it would be you.
Dialogue||Nobody gets along with everyone. I bet you're pretending!
Dialogue||What can I say, I've always had an easy time making friends. All you have to do is treat people nicely. What's hard about that?
Dialogue||It's sad you can't believe that I'm nice enough to have a lot of friends... It tells me a lot about you, XX.
Dialogue||Where's the worst place you've been stationed?
Dialogue||If you could live anywhere, where would it be?
Dialogue||My first assignment was protecting an outpost from ice ghasts in the freezing north. Given the orders, I would take that fight again without blinking... but I'm sure thankful to be here instead!
Dialogue||You know, I don't think I have an answer. The military takes me all over the world so I've lived just about everywhere.[]I guess I care less about where I am than who I'm with. I'd be happy to settle just about anywhere if I had family with me - and maybe a dog!
Dialogue||I feel like cooking tonight! But what to cook, what to cook...
Dialogue||I've got some running around to do, but I'll definitely see you in town!								
Dialogue||Jingle jingle, don't you like how Kitty's bells jingle? Teehee.
Dialogue||Your bells must make sneaking up on critters hard.
Dialogue||Why do you have so many jingle bells on your outfit, anyway?
Dialogue||Give Kitty more credit, XX! If Kitty is prowling, the bells don't make a sound! Kitty only jingles with Kitty wants to jingle!
Dialogue||I just like the sound they make! Jingle jingle! Kitty can make music whenever, wherever! Claude says Kitty's bells don't count as music, but Kitty disagrees! Nya!
Dialogue||Makes sense. You're a cat, after all.
Dialogue||You can really move that quietly?
Dialogue||Why do you think my name is <i>Kitty</i>, nya?!
Dialogue||Of course, of course! It's real easy for Kitty to be nice and quiet! When Kitty wants to be, of course! Other times Kitty jingle, jingle, jingles! Nya!
Dialogue||Claude can be very picky about music.
Dialogue||Claude isn't wrong.
Dialogue||Teehee, I knew you'd understand. Claude is just a stick-in-the-mud! Jingle jingle!
Dialogue||Nyan? Kitty didn't think XX was such a stick-in-the-mud! You must be hanging out with Claude too much, nya!
Dialogue||Nobody in this town takes my punches like you, XX!																													
Dialogue||Neighbors are friends! Liam said so.							
Dialogue||Who knows how much longer the army will keep us in Sun Haven? Frankly, I don't care if they keep us here forever.
Dialogue||What would you do if you were shipped out somewhere else?
Dialogue||I'm guessing your soldiers might not agree, though.
Dialogue||If the army took me someplace else, I'd have to go. Whether I like it or not, that's what it means to give your service to the military.[]What would you do if I had to leave?
Dialogue||If they want to leave Sun Haven, then they don't have their heads on straight.[]Anyway, any one of them can file for a transfer at any time. If I don't get any transfer requests, then I assume they're all happy.
Dialogue||I would wait here for you.
Dialogue||I would move on.
Dialogue||You would, really? That's extremely romantic, XX! I can't believe I got so lucky with you.
Dialogue||Ouch. Just like that, huh? Maybe we aren't equally invested in this marriage, XX.
Dialogue||Have you ever transferred that way?
Dialogue||Why do they let soldiers transfer, anyway?
Dialogue||Only once. I transferred from the Northern Region to the Great City when my mother was sick so I could care for her.[]I was worried about her, but I was more than happy to leave the old, cold north behind.
Dialogue||Well, I had to do it once. I transferred from the Northern Region to the Great City when my mother was sick so I could care for her.[]I was worried about her, but I was more than happy to leave the old, cold north behind.
Dialogue||Sorry, did you say something? I was running drills in my head.																							
Dialogue||Can I be honest with you, XX? The beach is looking really good right about now!
Dialogue||I thought you didn't take vacations.
Dialogue||What's your favorite thing to do when you're at the beach?
Dialogue||A quick trip down to the sand isn't the same thing as a vacation. I love to wiggle my toes into the warm sand every now and again.
Dialogue||Actually, I'd love to learn to make a good sand castle. I see the children doing it all the time, but I don't think I'd be any good at it. Maybe they would have to teach me!
Dialogue||I could get some sand between my toes!
Dialogue||Aren't you worried about crabs pinching you?
Dialogue||Maybe you can join me sometime! If we ever find ourselves with free time, of course. Don't forget to take care of your work first.
Dialogue||Oh, come now. I'm the Archmage of Sun Haven. I'm not going to worry about a few small crabs trying to nip me on the toes. At least, I won't worry much, anyways!
Dialogue||You do make a pretty good student.
Dialogue||As if a bunch of kids would have anything to teach you.
Dialogue||I feel confident with learning new things, really. I have the challenges I overcame during my upbringing to thank for that.
Dialogue||It's a shame to learn that you feel that way. There's so much in our lives we can learn from, especially children.
Dialogue||Good day, neighbor! Stay and chat a bit? 
Dialogue||So who's the best soldier in the corps? 
Dialogue||How did you end up here?
Dialogue||Ah sheesh, you can't ask me something like that. I don't want to hurt anyone's feelings.
Dialogue||I joined the army after they saved my village from a rampaging golem. Nathaniel and Roza led the defense themselves, riding in on horseback and forcing the golem back into the mountains.[]After seeing that I thought, "Wow, those are real heroes." I guess I wanted to be a hero too!
Dialogue||I get it. You just don't want to say it's you!
Dialogue||Come on, I won't tell.
Dialogue||What! I mean, thank you, but it's definitely not me.[]Look, I'll say this - it's one of the women and she's a strong leader. That should make it pretty obvious... 
Dialogue||Really, I don't like judging people like this. It feels too gossipy.
Dialogue||What's the most heroic thing you've done so far? 
Dialogue||Do you feel like a hero now? 
Dialogue||Sun Haven was my first assignment, so... Last week I saved Lucia's lunch from a bird. Does that count as heroism?
Dialogue||Hello there, XX. The other day I was speaking with Nathaniel and he tells me there's been a noticable decline in monsters outside the town borders.[]You wouldn't happen to be responsible, would you?
Dialogue||I've slain a few monsters, I suppose.
Dialogue||Is the town in any danger of monsters?
Dialogue||You can farm <i>and</i> fight! Very commendable, XX. Truly, I mean that. It isn't your job, but the safer the forests beyond the town are, the better!
Dialogue||Sun Haven itself is completely secure, though you should know that by now. However, the forests are teeming with dangerous monsters.[]Travel, at least by foot, is therefore quite dangerous for those who can't defend themselves. Someday I want to change that, and make travel of all kinds safe for everyone.
Dialogue||Can't the guards deal with monsters on their own?
Dialogue||Don't mention it, it's great to help out.
Dialogue||Well of course the town is capable of defending itself, XX. The guards do an excellent job, and I'm always ready to help fill in when needed.[]I merely wanted to thank you for helping out.
Dialogue||That's the kind of attitude we need in Sun Haven! We're very lucky to have someone as muti-talented as you here. Elios said he sensed great potential in you, and it shows.
Dialogue||How will you accomplish that vision?
Dialogue||There's a lot of monsters in the forest!
Dialogue||It might sound like a big task, but Sun Haven hosts some very strong soldiers. Perhaps we could establish dedicated monster slaying units?[]Though I'd hate to put any of our troops in harm's way. Hm, I'll have to really put some thought into this.
Dialogue||It might sound like a big task, but Sun Haven hosts some very strong soldiers. Perhaps we could establish dedicated monster slaying units?[]Though I'd hate to put any of our troops directly in harm's way. Hm, I'll have to really put some thought into this.
Dialogue||Oh, XX. You're looking a little tired, are you working extra hard these days?
Dialogue||What about you? Have you been busy lately?
Dialogue||You work so much, how do you always seem so calm?
Dialogue||Not any more busy than usual, so... I guess that's still a yes. A project of mine is keeping me up at night. But self-planting seeds will be huge when I'm done!
Dialogue||Is that a bad thing? I don't like being too rowdy is all. Keeping myself calm helps me focus.
Dialogue||Just don't forget to take care of yourself.
Dialogue||It's lucky you have something to be excited about, at least.
Dialogue||I know you're right and I should treat myself better, but I get so wrapped up in my research that I just don't have the capacity to care.
Dialogue||Thanks XX. Most people just lecture me on self-care. They're not wrong or anything, I just don't have the capacity to care right now.
Dialogue||You should let your feelings out more often.
Dialogue||It shows great self-control.
Dialogue||Don't assume that I'm suppressing my feelings just because I'm calm. Did you ever think that maybe I'm just, actually calm?
Dialogue||That's the first time anyone's ever said that about me. I usually get the opposite...
Dialogue||Do I have any icing on my face? I was teaching Elizabeth to decorate cakes earlier and things got messy.
Dialogue||Don't worry, your face is perfect.
Dialogue||Have you told the girls that we're dating?
Dialogue||Well I wouldn't call it perfect...
Dialogue||I had that conversation with them last night. It took a looooot of explaining, but they know about us now.[]They were more curious than anything, but they're excited that I'm "best friends with the farmer." Especially Emma!
Dialogue||Well I think you're the sweetest guy in Sun Haven - literally!
Dialogue||Don't sell yourself short, Liam. You're the handsomest guy in Sun Haven!
Dialogue||Ah sheesh, and now I think I'm the embarrassed-est guy in Sun Haven. You know compliments make me self-conscious!
Dialogue||I don't really care what they think about us, anyway.
Dialogue||It sounds like you handled it well. I'm glad you told them.
Dialogue||Is that true? I'm surprised you don't care what they think.
Dialogue||Thanks, I was on the fence about it at first. I don't even know why, now that I think about it.
Dialogue||Oh! It's you...[]Um, the new farmer! Sorry, you caught me with my head in the clouds. I'm Jun.
Dialogue||I didn't mean to startle you. My name's XX.
Dialogue||No no, it's fine. I was just in my head is all. It's really nice meeting you, XX.
Dialogue||You again. I expect you've learned to watch your tongue around me.[]My father didn't build this place from nothing just to have peasants like you disrespecting the royal family.
Dialogue||Withergate is quite impressive.
Dialogue||How did your father become king of Withergate?
Dialogue||Of course it is. I didn't design the city myself, but I personally recommended the architect. Xyla is well known among monsters for her skill and ferocity.
Dialogue||My family has always been royalty among monsters and Withergate was founded by my family. Is it so hard to put two and two together?
Dialogue||You must have good taste in friends, then.
Dialogue||I've already met her!
Dialogue||I only give my time freely to people of a certain class - a class to which you don't belong.
Dialogue||That's good. Now you've seen an example of who earns my respect.
Dialogue||I didn't know - please forgive my ignorance!
Dialogue||I was only wondering.
Dialogue||Of course not, you know nothing. I've heard the talk among the Humans in Sun Haven. Such tiny, stupid people.
Dialogue||Go waste someone else's time with your idiotic questions.
Dialogue||You ever been so far down a mineshaft, you forget which way is up?						
Dialogue||I just cracked a project I've been working on for the last few months. Self-trimming grass!
Dialogue||I'm curious how 'self-trimming' grass works.
Dialogue||It seems like such an innovative invention.
Dialogue||Okay, so it's not really "self-trimming" in the sense it cuts itself. But it only grows to a certain height![]This first variation tops out at around two inches, but now I can make future variants that grow to varying heights. Great for lawn control!
Dialogue||I look at life as being a never-ending race, there's always something you can improve and make better![] First I'll probably take it to Nivara and get her approval. She likes to have the first look at anything I create, at least. Then I'll show it off to the Elven Elder.[]If he likes it, and believe me he always does, we'll roll it out around Nel'Vari. We'll just have to replace the native grass first, of course. But no more trimming!
Dialogue||How did you do it?
Dialogue||I can't even imagine how that works.
Dialogue||Great question! Well, let me explain in a way that's easy to understand...[]Plants, like anything else that's living, have certain "switches" inside of them that tell them how big to grow. I just found a way to manipulate those switches in grass. 
Dialogue||Well, let me explain in a way that's easy to understand...[]Plants, like anything else that's living, have certain "switches" inside of them that tell them how big to grow. I just found a way to manipulate those switches in grass.  
Dialogue||The native grass is boring and unenchanted, anyways.
Dialogue||So the current grass has to be gotten rid of? That seems a bit extreme.
Dialogue||I don't think Nel'Vari's native grass is bad or anything, but I do love knowing that you're in-tune with perpetual progress! 
Dialogue||That is how progress works, XX. My enchanted grass is easier to control, and will never have to be trimmed down to size.[]But you didn't stop to consider any of that, did you? 
Dialogue||Is that what you're wearing for armor? You should upgrade if you're expecting trouble.
Dialogue||How would I upgrade my armor?
Dialogue||Have you seen Elios?
Dialogue||You've got two options. The first is to put work into your smelter and anvil and make it yourself. The second is to bring me the gold to make it for you.
Dialogue||Of course I have. I've lived here all my life, haven't I?
Dialogue||I'll make it myself.
Dialogue||I can't make it as well as you.
Dialogue||Good for you, kid. Don't quit working at it. You only get better with practice, you know.
Dialogue||Not yet you can't. One day, who knows? You only get better with practice, you know.
Dialogue||Are you upset that he didn't give you his blessing? 
Dialogue||What did he say to you? 
Dialogue||That's not something to get upset about. Making a fuss because you weren't given a gift? That's behaving like a child.
Dialogue||I don't remember it word for word. It was some time back, now.[]It might've been, "As a newborn dragon breaks from the egg, your future will be born of flame."[]Have to say, he hit the nail on the head with that one.
Dialogue||I knew that was you. I could spot you a mile away, XX.
Dialogue||It's a much much happier day when I can see you, XX.														
Dialogue||Are you lost, or just exploring?							
Dialogue||The people in this town are the best... even better when they're having a drink!																	
Dialogue||The Demon King Minos assigned me to the council himself.																																																																						
Dialogue||Sometimes I can't believe how quickly everything has changed.																																																																				
Dialogue||It's no surprise that the partner of my dreams would come from Sun Haven.																																														
Dialogue||How are you today, my muse?																																									
Dialogue||I was thinking about hosting a cookout. Maybe some drinks, and a lot of meat roasting over an open fire.
Dialogue||But you live in a sewer. Where would you host a cookout?
Dialogue||What would you serve other than meat?
Dialogue||Good point. Didn't think about that. Well, no biggie. We'll host it right on the streets of Withergate! Everyone's invited! Plenty of drinks, friends and meat. Lots of meat.
Dialogue||What else is there, XX? Meat is like, I dunno, most of what I eat. I don't know much about other types of food, other than I don't like them as much as meat.[]I'm just going to focus on doing what I know best. No sense in trying something new and screwing it up.
Dialogue||Where did you get everything for this cookout?
Dialogue||How will you get the invites out?
Dialogue||Yeah, see. That's the thing. I don't have it all yet. Well, more accurately, I don't have any of it yet. But like I said, it's all in the planning stage of things.[]Let's dream big and worry logistics later. 
Dialogue||Oh that's the easy part. Just mention it to a few of the bats around the city. They blab about everything. Give it a few hours and half the town will know what's going down.
Dialogue||Sounds great, as long as everyone loves meat!
Dialogue||You should give new things a try.
Dialogue||Hey, if they don't like meat then they can go host their <i>own</i> cookout! But Donovan's cookout is serving meat, meat, meat!!
Dialogue||Nah, been there, hated that. I know what I like, XX. Don't try changing that, because I'm not interested.
Dialogue||You know XX, you could come visit me at my home sometime... if you wanted.
Dialogue||If I wanted to bring you a gift, what would you like?
Dialogue||Have you invited anyone to your house before?
Dialogue||There isn't much I need that I can't get myself, XX. You've seen my house, right?
Dialogue||Actually... huh, no I haven't. Congratulations on being the first, I guess.
Dialogue||I don't care!
Dialogue||I still think it would be nice.
Dialogue||Well, fine then. I can always use fresh food. In fact, it's been a while since I've had fresh cinaberry.
Dialogue||I'm honored!
Dialogue||It's weird that I'm the first.
Dialogue||I'm glad, but you don't have to make a big thing about it.
Dialogue||Well somebody has to be the first...
Dialogue||The farmer, hello again.
Dialogue||Have you worked with Lucia long?
Dialogue||So what exactly is your job?
Dialogue||You could say that. I was good friends with her grandparents, so I've known her since she was a young girl growing up here.
Dialogue||I'm the town administrator, meaning I take care of all the managerial business that Lucia is too busy to perform. I also officiate marriages, should anyone in town be so lucky.
Dialogue||Would you say you're friends? 
Dialogue||So you knew her personally, before she was Archmage? 
Dialogue||I suppose that's the right term. It feels almost like a guardianship, though I know she needs no guidance from me.[]Still, I can't help but remember her as a child toddling around the town square in diapers.[]Oh, please don't tell her I mentioned that. For obvious reasons, she hates when I bring that up.
Dialogue||When the day came that she became the town's Archmage, I couldn't believe it. I can still see her toddling around the town square in diapers, and now she leads all of Sun Haven.[]Yes, I know her well. Her spirit is undefeatable. She will pull us out of the struggle we find ourselves in. And I have promised to help her the whole way.
Dialogue||Your work sounds important!
Dialogue||Are you bored with your job?
Dialogue||Indeed it is, even though it's entirely behind the scenes. However, I don't necessarily need recognition to make an impact on Sun Haven.
Dialogue||It sounds that boring to you? Good thing it's not your job then. I enjoy helping the town, so I enjoy my work.
Dialogue||Am I extra pale? Maybe I've been in darkness too long.																																																					
Dialogue||You've really become a valuable part of our community, XX.[]I just wanted to tell you that because I think it's important to let people know their value. It's good for morale!
Dialogue||Thanks Nathaniel, but my morale is just fine.
Dialogue||You seem to think about morale a lot.
Dialogue||Yeah, I can tell! You must be doing well on the farm, eh? Glad to see it, truly.[]And I mean what I said, XX. Sun Haven wouldn't feel the same without you here.
Dialogue||Morale is our very best weapon, XX! A good mood keeps a soldier focused and gives them hope in a tight spot.[]And if they never see a fight, then at least they enjoyed their day!
Dialogue||The farm is doing quite well, thanks!
Dialogue||I'm glad I can help with my farm.
Dialogue||It must be nice, working on a quiet farm all on your own. The barracks can feel a bit crowded sometimes. It would be nice to have some privacy...[]Oh well, I'll get it one day. For now, it's duty through service as always.
Dialogue||This is why you're such a good leader.
Dialogue||That's childish, a good mood can't replace proper training.
Dialogue||Heh, well thanks! Not everyone in town sees the value in my leadership strategy. I appreciate your support, XX.
Dialogue||It's foolish of you to think that I would cut back on my soldiers' training for any reason. Trust me, each soldier in the Sun Haven Corps is a capable fighter.
Dialogue||Say, are you feeling okay XX? You look a little... I don't know. Preoccupied?
Dialogue||Ah, our future! Yes, let's plan for the future. Just, excuse me if I get a little fidgety. Thinking too far ahead gets me quite anxious, but you know that.
Dialogue||Am I happy? Do I seem sad? Oh sheesh, have I been worrying you or something? I'm sorry XX, I don't mean to give you any reason to doubt.[]I'm <i>very</i> happy being with you, XX. Happier than I've ever been, actually.
Dialogue||I think we'll be together for a long time, Liam.
Dialogue||I might want to stay in Sun Haven for a long time.
Dialogue||Oh! Well thank goodness. That's actually nice to think about, XX. It isn't often I enjoy planning ahead, you know.
Dialogue||So would you want to be this happy, forever?
Dialogue||Oh... I see.[]I'll help in any way I can. I just, uh, don't really know how to.
Dialogue||Forever... OH. Wow. Sorry XX, I'm just kind of caught off guard here.[]But of course, I love the idea of being with you for as long as possible. If that means wearing a ring on my finger, then go ahead and give me the ring![]Er, I didn't mean right now. Just, whenever you're ready XX.
Dialogue||Gotta keep my claws sharp, nya!
Dialogue||Farming can be dangerous if you're using rusty old tools. I hope you're being safe!		
Dialogue||Hey neighbor, you're looking fit! Is that from farming, or are you a health nut like me? Both, I bet.
Dialogue||Do you like delivering mail?
Dialogue||Doesn't it get tiring, being so healthy all the time?
Dialogue||Well I get to see everybody in town once a day and I get some great cardio out of it. I don't see any downside!
Dialogue||Sure it does, but being tired makes me happy. I never feel better than when my muscles are all sore from a really good workout.
Dialogue||You'll get bored of it sooner or later.
Dialogue||No wonder you're a great courier - you have a great attitude.
Dialogue||You don't know me very well, farmer.
Dialogue||It's true, your attitude does affect the job! That being said, I'd bet you're a top-notch farmer.
Dialogue||What's your favorite way to exercise?
Dialogue||Where do you usually work out in town?
Dialogue||I like running on the beach in the morning when the sun comes up. I imagine the sunrise is like my reward.
Dialogue||Hello, XX. Are you still getting used to Sun Haven? It takes some time.
Dialogue||Were you born in this town, Claude?
Dialogue||Are you worried about Sun Haven?
Dialogue||I'm from Sun Haven, but my family moved to the Great City a while back. I've actually lived most of my life there.
Dialogue||Why would I be? If the town goes under, I'll just move away. What's there to worry about?
Dialogue||So why are you here now?
Dialogue||I moved here from the Great City, too.
Dialogue||I moved back into town to get a little peace and quiet while I work.
Dialogue||We have that in common, then. I never want to set foot in that city again, if I'm being honest. So dirty and loud.
Dialogue||That's pretty cold hearted.
Dialogue||But what about the people in town?
Dialogue||If you say so. Anyway, I'm not here to save anyone.
Dialogue||I guess I see your point... the people have been good to me here. But that doesn't mean I can change anything.
Dialogue||One day, I'm going to be a rich merchant like Anne!																																																																																																																																																																																																				
Dialogue||One of my favorite things to do here is just wander the streets.																																					
Dialogue||We've come so far together, XX. I think Sun Haven is really on the cusp of growing truly great.
Dialogue||Why are you always so concerned with Sun Haven?
Dialogue||I'm glad I get to share this time with you.
Dialogue||I gave my life to Sun Haven. It was part of answering a 'higher calling' for me.[]I also gave my life to you, but I'll always have to balance between being the Archmage and being your wife.
Dialogue||There's no one else in the world I'd rather be with right now than you, XX.[]We both worked very hard to turn Sun Haven around, and now we can watch the fruits of those labors together.
Dialogue||I understand, Lucia.
Dialogue||You need to commit to me more.
Dialogue||I know you do, XX. It's a big part of why I chose you to spend the rest of my life with. It isn't always the easiest, but I'll work hard to be a great wife. You'll see.
Dialogue||I know it won't always be the most ideal, but you're the one I chose to spend the rest of my life with. Just try with me and I think you'll see it will work.
Dialogue||Does this mean you'll take your job easier from now on?
Dialogue||I'm ready to work for the future with you, Lucia.
Dialogue||Not at all! If anything, I think we both have to work even harder from now on! Don't worry, I'm going to be right beside you the entire time. We'll do it together.
Dialogue||I'm ready, too, XX. If anything, I think we both have to work even harder from now on! Don't worry, I'm going to be right beside you the entire time. We'll do it together.
Dialogue||Maybe it's just Kitty, but Sun Haven smells even better than it used to!																																																																										
Dialogue||Kitty thinks XX looks especially good today, nya!
Dialogue||Kitty, you're adorable but also kind of intense.
Dialogue||Do you feel okay? You look a little red.
Dialogue||I've heard that before, nya! I think it's a compliment. Do you like it?
Dialogue||I spent yesterday prowling the areas near your farm, nyaa. I wanted to protect it for you now that we're a couple! Maybe that's weird...Woops, tee hee. But the farm is safe, nya!
Dialogue||I wish you were more calm.
Dialogue||I love it - you make every day fun!
Dialogue||Calm? Ooh sorry XX, I thought you knew me better than that!
Dialogue||Oh, good! Not everyone thinks the same, but it doesn't bother me. Kitty has to be Kitty, after all!
Dialogue||Good to know it's safe, thanks Kitty!
Dialogue||You don't have to do that. 
Dialogue||Nya! You're so very welcome! I have to protect you and your land, nya.[]Plus it's fun! I get to chase off pesky squirrels and rabbits, teehee.
Dialogue||I know I don't <i>have</i> to, but I like to! I only want to help XX, like XX helps Kitty!
Dialogue||I like to train as much as possible just to be sure I'm up to snuff.											
Dialogue||Up for a cup?											
Dialogue||It's really nice, you know. Having a family again.																																																				
Dialogue||It's impressive that you found your way into Nel'Vari. It says a lot about you as a person, I think.												
Dialogue||XX, welcome back. It's a beautiful day in Nel'Vari, huh?
Dialogue||It seems like everyday is a beautiful day around here.
Dialogue||Do you like living in Nel'Vari, Iris?
Dialogue||You're right, we're really lucky. I've heard things about other parts of the world where there are no plants at all - just big flat spaces with rocks and sand. I've never seen it, but it sounds terrible!
Dialogue||Sure I do. I mean, this is the perfect place for my work.  
Dialogue||I don't know. It's not like plants are much better.
Dialogue||I wouldn't be able to live without plants and animals around me.
Dialogue||What... but... plants are SO much better than rocks! They give us food and air, and rocks just give us... more rocks.[]Oof, I need to cool off after that one.
Dialogue||I feel exactly the same way. Surrounding yourself with life makes life itself sweeter. Nivara told me that.
Dialogue||What makes it perfect for your work here?
Dialogue||Sounds like work is your main priority, huh?
Dialogue||My enchanting blends the lines between nature and magic. Nel'Vari does something similar, but with Elves. In a way, Nel'Vari is like one big natural experiment itself.
Dialogue||Enchanting is my life. The work is complicated and beautiful... but sometimes I get so focused on it that I forget other things. Like today, I can't remember if I've eaten anything![]I could really go for some noodles right now. There's a shop in the plaza that makes my favorite spicy ramen.[]If you're going to the plaza then maybe you could grab me a bowl?? Thanks in advance!
Dialogue||Sun Haven only gets more beautiful with each passing day. Don't you think so, XX?
Dialogue||You're not dating anyone, are you Lucia?
Dialogue||You really deserve to enjoy these beautiful days. Why don't we go on a date?
Dialogue||Oh no, not at the moment. I have precious little free time, so I prefer to wait until someone particularly special comes along. Although, I've certainly had my share of admirers.
Dialogue||I try to make time for myself, but it's difficult. There is always so much to be done.[]Perhaps you're right. A date would be a nice break from my daily work!
Dialogue||That's no surprise to me!
Dialogue||It seems inappropriate for the Archmage to date their citizens.
Dialogue||Be careful now, you might make a lady blush! And don't think I haven't noticed how special you are, XX. 
Dialogue||I suppose I see where you're coming from, but that doesn't leave me many options. XX, I'm afraid that simply makes no sense.
Dialogue||Then again, maybe this isn't a good idea.
Dialogue||Why don't you meet me in front of the town hall tomorrow at 5:00 pm?
Dialogue||We shouldn't do anything that makes you uncomfortable, XX.
Dialogue||If you ever get tired of that Human town, there's always room in the sewer!																					
Dialogue||I've been thinking about trying something... different. Maybe fishing?
Dialogue||I can't believe you want to try something that isn't music.
Dialogue||Trying something new might help you with your music.
Dialogue||Well, I feel like a new man. I'll never stop obsessing over my music, but maybe it's time to broaden my horizons. You're always doing all sorts of stuff, after all. 
Dialogue||You know, I had a talk with Jun a while back, and he said something along the same lines. At the time I thought it was nonsense, but now that I've met you, I wonder...
Dialogue||You with a fishing rod, that'll be the day.
Dialogue||I think it's amazing you want to try new things.
Dialogue||I thought you'd be excited. This is... a sour surprise. 
Dialogue||I knew you'd be excited. Maybe this is the start of a brand new Claude. With you, my muse. 
Dialogue||Give it a go. It can't hurt.
Dialogue||Do what makes you comfortable.
Dialogue||You're right. Maybe it really will help. And at least I can say I tried, that'd make Jun happy if nothing else. 
Dialogue||I was worried you'd push me really hard to give it a go, but it's nice that you're not breathing down my neck about it.
Dialogue||If you need help, you know where to find us.									 					
Dialogue||Not long ago, I thought Sun Haven had run out of surprises for me. Now I know just how wrong I was!
Dialogue||Are you saying I was the surprise?
Dialogue||Were you really getting bored here?
Dialogue||You were the biggest surprise of my life, XX. When I first saw you, it was like the world turned upside down.
Dialogue||Don't mince words, XX. I didn't say I was bored, only that there were no surprises left for me here.[]I can see how you'd think those are the same things. But for me, I feel contentment instead of boredom.
Dialogue||It took me a while, but I got there too.
Dialogue||I felt the same exact way.
Dialogue||I see. I guess "love at first sight" isn't for everyone.
Dialogue||I know you did, XX. And now that we're married, well, we have the rest of our lives to surprise each other.
Dialogue||Maybe I should practice that, too.
Dialogue||You must get bored sometimes.
Dialogue||It does take a little practice, but I'm sure you could get it. The hardest part is to remember that being bored is okay and not inherently bad.[]Some people avoid boredom like their lives depend on it. But I'll take a little boredom over meaningless distractions any day.
Dialogue||Well... one time I had to wait in line at the town hall for an hour while Albert asked questions about his property line. <i>That</i> was boring!
Dialogue||I was just thinking the other day, XX. You and I are like kindred flames!
Dialogue||What's a kindred flame?
Dialogue||What do you mean we're 'kindred flames'? 
Dialogue||Ah, you know. Like "peas in a pod" or "cut from the same cloth"? In Nel'Vari we usually say "kindred flame", though I've always thought I'm more of a 'breeze' than a 'flame'.
Dialogue||You go all over the place. Nel'Vari, Sun Haven. I'm pretty sure I've spotted you going towards Withergate, even! And you grew up in the Great City.[]I never want to stay in one place for very long, either. There's just so much world to be seen, and people like us gotta get out and see it!
Dialogue||What a neat saying.
Dialogue||Nel'Vari lingo can be kind of dramatic.
Dialogue||Yes, the words of Nel'Vari can certainly be pretty eloquent. I like the stuff they say in Sun Haven, though. More rustic and to the point.
Dialogue||I know, right? The words of Nel'Vari can certainly be pretty eloquent. I like the stuff they say in Sun Haven, though. More rustic and to the point.
Dialogue||The world was made to be explored.
Dialogue||I travel so I can earn a living, though.
Dialogue||Well said! And might I add, it's so commemorable that you do it all without even being able to fly! 
Dialogue||Well, sure. But come on, now. Are you telling me you don't enjoy the adventure of it...?
Dialogue||Another day in Sun Haven... sometimes the days here seem indistinguishable. But some days are special.
Dialogue||Special? Is today a special day, Claude?
Dialogue||Do you have any plans for the future, Claude?
Dialogue||I guess you could say that.[]I'm not used to sharing myself with people, but there's something nice about it. So I want to share something with you, XX. It's the key to my house.
Dialogue||Future? I can't think that far ahead. I'm trying to focus completely on the present. It's the only way I can make music.
Dialogue||Are you sure? This seems important.
Dialogue||I don't know what to say, Claude.
Dialogue||Sure it is, the key to my house is like the key to my life. I want you to know that you're welcome in my life, XX. Here, take it. 
Dialogue||Sure it is, the key to my house is like the key to my life. I want you to know that you're welcome in my life, XX. Here, take it.
Dialogue||If you never think of the future, then how will you make progress?
Dialogue||That's very fitting for you!
Dialogue||You obviously don't know what progress means to me. 
Dialogue||It sounds like you mean that as a compliment, so thank you. 
Dialogue||Walking around this town makes me think of all the great times I had growing up here.
Dialogue||What are your favorite memories from growing up?
Dialogue||Catherine, what's that in your basket there?
Dialogue||When we were quite young, all my siblings and I used to dig holes in the dirt to lay in on hot days. The digging was hard, but the cool dirt was worth it!
Dialogue||Oh right, I brought you something! Here, look - this is the strongest magic charm I've ever made. I know this can help you, XX. Try keeping it with you and you'll see! 
Dialogue||I would hate to clean up after all those kids.
Dialogue||To deal with eight dirty kids at once, your parents must have been magic too.
Dialogue||Surprisingly, they didn't seem to mind. Getting dirty is just part of life, I guess.
Dialogue||This is so thoughtful, thanks Catherine.
Dialogue||It is important, so keep it safe! I think I can trust you, XX. Now it's up to you to prove it. 
Dialogue||Treat it well, okay? I worked really hard to make it. I think I can trust you, XX. Now it's up to you to prove it.
Dialogue||You should know I'm never too busy to talk with you, XX.
Dialogue||Hey again, new farmer! I have to go care for my animals, but I'll look for you around town.
Dialogue||I'm a new man, XX. It's been a long time since I've felt so fearless!
Dialogue||You do seem to have a new energy about you.
Dialogue||When was the last time you felt this good?
Dialogue||I'm certain this strength is coming from you, XX. Thank you for being my support. You make me feel... frankly, invincible!
Dialogue||Why, it must have been when I was only a boy. My swearing-in as royal prince... I remember so clearly.[]The castle was filled with Demons from all across the land who came to pay respects to me. The crown settled on my head, and at the same time every person in the hall bent their knees to me.
Dialogue||Don't forget, you're flesh and blood like the rest of us.
Dialogue||Together, we <i>are</i> invincible, Darius.
Dialogue||Why must you dampen my celebration? I'm rejoicing - and you should be, too.
Dialogue||Haha! You've captured my heart, XX. Nobody in this city - or this world, for that matter - has such influence over me as you have. For that, I feel blessed.
Dialogue||That kind of power sounds intoxicating.
Dialogue||I can't wait until you're king, Darius.
Dialogue||Patience, my sweet XX. One day, a crown will be settled onto your fine head and you will receive the same honor.
Dialogue||Lucia has asked me to compose a "town anthem" for Sun Haven. I'd like to decline, but she seemed really excited about it.
Dialogue||Do you not want to compose a town anthem for Sun Haven?
Dialogue||If Lucia asked you personally, she must really want you to do it.
Dialogue||Not especially, no. It's a quaint idea, but I just don't know what Lucia would be expecting. It seems like it's doomed to fail.
Dialogue||She does. She spoke a lot about "pride in Sun Haven" all that. I like living in Sun Haven, but I can't really see myself composing music in its honor.
Dialogue||You have a pretty sour attitude about it.
Dialogue||Try asking Lucia to clarify what she wants.
Dialogue||Oh well. Call it what you want, it's just how I feel.
Dialogue||That is one option, yes. If I'm really going to go through with this request, of course. I suppose at the very least I can ask her exactly what she wants from me.
Dialogue||If you aren't inspired then the music wouldn't be good, anyways.
Dialogue||Lucia asked you, so you should really try.
Dialogue||It's good you know me well enough to understand that I can't just force music to happen. I'll just have to explain that to Lucia next time we talk. 
Dialogue||I can't just force myself to write music, XX. It doesn't work like that. 
Dialogue||It's my new favorite person, XX![]Let's talk.
Dialogue||You seem to know this town well. What do you do for fun around here?
Dialogue||So you live here?
Dialogue||I hang around the carnival a lot. I wait for people to lose the games so I can step up and win right afterwards, heheh.[]Honestly, how hard is it to knock some bottles down?
Dialogue||Sure, why wouldn't I? It's the city of darkness! What am I going to do, just pass up the chance to live in darkness forever? I don't think so.
Dialogue||Carnival?
Dialogue||That sounds kind of mean.
Dialogue||Don't tell me you haven't been to the carnival yet! Man, you're in for a treat. The food is unhealthy and there are so many people that you can't escape the body odor! You'll love it.
Dialogue||I promise, I'm only mean when it's funny.
Dialogue||Only monsters live in darkness.
Dialogue||Maybe I should try living in the darkness for a while.
Dialogue||Well... yeah. Look around, we're all monsters here. You might want to rethink your view on monsters. Or at least, shut up about it!
Dialogue||Really, you? I would love to see that! You could show the Human town that not everything is scary in the dark.
Dialogue||Oh, XX! I was thinking of pet names since we're dating now. I'm thinking something like, my little... sponge cake?[]Eh, maybe it's better if I just stick with your real name.
Dialogue||I'll just call you Liam, anyway.
Dialogue||You look nervous. Are you nervous?
Dialogue||Heh, okay. At least that's settled.[]I've never met anyone who was as patient with me as you are, XX. I mean, maybe Jun, but that's his job.
Dialogue||I'm sorry, it's just been a long time since I was in a relationship.[]The last time was when I was a kid in school. This other kid called me their boyfriend, but I'm pretty sure it was just because I had cookies in my lunch bag.
Dialogue||Patient in what way?
Dialogue||You know I stumble over words here and there. I don't exactly have the social skills of Lucia or Nathaniel.[]I'm just really, really lucky to have found someone like you, XX.
Dialogue||That's what attracted me to you, too.
Dialogue||I can't believe it's been that long for you.
Dialogue||Oh - you're kidding! Haha, see? I'm not always nervous. I totally got that you were joking. Totally joking.
Dialogue||I haven't exactly had a ton of time for dating since I started taking care of the girls.
Dialogue||Hey, I think I can smell the last meal you ate. Did you have... tree bark? Wait no, that must be something else.
Dialogue||You're probably smelling my farm, Donovan.
Dialogue||Why would you want to smell my last meal, anyway?
Dialogue||Yeah, okay that makes a lot of sense. I didn't take you for a tree-eater.
Dialogue||People are usually impressed by that trick. Then again, I also usually get it right. Guess today's not my lucky day, huh?
Dialogue||What's a tree-eater?
Dialogue||Still, your nose is pretty impressive!
Dialogue||Someone who eats trees, obviously. Not that I've ever met anyone who did...
Dialogue||Ah, thanks! I try to keep a sharp sniffer in case of emergencies. 
Dialogue||I'm sure it's really impressive when it works!
Dialogue||That's a silly trick anyway.
Dialogue||Heheh, yeah! Maybe I'll try again next time to really impress you. 
Dialogue||Huh, you might be right... Maybe it's time to retire that tired old trick. 
Dialogue||Lucia honored me with a medal of recognition for my work the other day. Sorry, I'm not bragging, I'm just kind of touched, is all.
Dialogue||You totally deserved it.
Dialogue||So what's your medal look like?
Dialogue||You think so, too? I work real hard and everything, but I can't shake the feeling this honor could've gone to someone... more deserving. Did I really earn it?
Dialogue||Ah, it's really beautiful. I'd show it to you, but I've put it away for safekeeping.[]It's a golden emblem with Elios' likeness carved into it, along with the words "FOR SERVICE TO SUN HAVEN."[]Lucia's signature is also engraved on it, which is a nice touch.
Dialogue||Don't doubt yourself so much, you're doing great.
Dialogue||So you think Lucia made a mistake?
Dialogue||I know I shouldn't be down on myself, but sometimes it's hard... though if you and the Archmage are telling me I'm doing great, then maybe I should listen![]Heh, thanks for the shot of confidence, XX.
Dialogue||Lucia is a very wise Archmage, I never implied she was mistaken. I'm just not sure <i>why</i> it was me. Don't get the wrong idea, XX.
Dialogue||Sounds fancy.
Dialogue||You should frame it.
Dialogue||It's certainly a thing to behold. I still can't believe they chose me for it, really.
Dialogue||I may just have to do that one of these days. Right now I still can't believe they chose me for it, really.
Dialogue||I hope you're good at tag.																																																																																																																																							
Dialogue||If you're going out into the wilds, you'll want some protection - trust me.																		
Dialogue||... You're looking at me funny. But not in a way that makes me want to laugh.[]Okay, you're creeping me out. What's the big idea?
Dialogue||Xyla, you're not dating anybody, right?
Dialogue||Here's the thing, Xyla... Let's go out.
Dialogue||Wow, strong assumption, outsider. Are you trying to leave town bruised?[]If I'm not dating anyone, it's just because there's nobody in this town worth my time.
Dialogue||Go... Date?? Wow, sewer rat! I never thought you'd be brave enough to ask me.
Dialogue||Really? But there are so many people in Withergate.
Dialogue||Yeah, most people here are far below you.
Dialogue||And here I was just starting to think you were fun to talk to. No surprise you went and ruined it, sewer rat.
Dialogue||Ugh... flattery. I hate that I love it.
Dialogue||On second thought, this was a mistake.
Dialogue||Maybe there's more to me than you know!
Dialogue||Chickening out after you asked? I'm not surprised. You would just bore me anyway.
Dialogue||Okay then, why not? Let's see what happens. If nothing else, it could be hilarious! Meet me in front of my apartment at 5:00 pm tomorrow.
Dialogue||What a lovely evening. I want to watch the sun rise over the castle.											
Dialogue||This talk about Withergate has me on edge. Am I the only one?																																		
Dialogue||You look tired, XX. You need a cat nap, nya!					
Dialogue||Hello! I'm Elizabeth. Who are you?
Dialogue||Farmer?? That's so cool! My brother is Liam, and he does the bakery.
Dialogue||Maybe when I'm grown like you, I'll have enough money to buy my own farm.																																																																																																																																																																																						
Dialogue||Guess what, XX? I figured out a new wind magic technique! Watch... actually, I'm nervous now that you're watching.				
Dialogue||XX, wonderful seeing you. I hope the farm is doing well. 
Dialogue||Do you work, Kara?
Dialogue||What do you do for fun?
Dialogue||Yes, but my work can all be done from home. Thank goodness for that.[]You must be wondering what I do. I write speeches for leaders across the world. Dignitaries, ambassadors, even a king or two.
Dialogue||I like to watch Topi and Pod running around the yard, or sometimes I'll dive into a new book. I'd really like to learn a craft, though.
Dialogue||Sitting around writing all day sounds unhealthy.
Dialogue||Kings?? You must be a great writer!
Dialogue||What a negative thing to focus on. Not that you need to know, but I take fine care of myself.
Dialogue||I should hope so![]All I do is wait for another job to come in the mail, write the speech, and send it back. My payment comes a few days later. It's the best job for me, in my situation.
Dialogue||What kind of craft? 
Dialogue||What's stopping you?
Dialogue||Something with my hands, like pottery. Giuseppe has offered to get me some clay, but I don't want to be a bother to him. 
Dialogue||Oh, I'm not sure. I just haven't taken the leap yet. Who knows, maybe today is the day that inspiration takes me.[]Maybe... leatherwork? Or, needlepoint? There are so many possibilities!
Dialogue||Phew, you stink! 
Dialogue||Wait, you said I stink? Are you serious?
Dialogue||So, what... are you?
Dialogue||Yeah! You smell, like grass and salt. It's disgusting!
Dialogue||What kind of question is that? I'm a Slime! You expect me to believe you've never seen a Slime before??
Dialogue||I can't believe <i>you</i> think <i>I'm</i> disgusting.
Dialogue||It's too bad I don't smell like you...
Dialogue||What's that supposed to mean? You trying to be funny??
Dialogue||You can! You want some slime? Cover up that stink? Let me know!
Dialogue||I've never seen a Slime. 
Dialogue||Where would I have seen a Slime? 
Dialogue||You mean I have to be your first Slime? So uncultured, so uneducated... It's too bad you couldn't meet a nice Slime first. Like my wife!
Dialogue||We mostly live in garbage dumps. But I moved to the big city for work! I have to support my Slime family!
Dialogue||My sister Emma is the yuckiest. She makes me play in the dirt with her.							
Dialogue||XX! I've been looking for you. Here, I brought you something to keep you strong.
Dialogue||I've been meaning to tell you... You have the most beautiful hair!
Dialogue||I was wondering... Did you put a romance spell on me??
Dialogue||Why thank you, XX! I know the best herbal remedies for healthy, vibrant hair. There's no magic involved at all!
Dialogue||Oh? You're just now thinking of this? Hm... Did I... Did I... I guess you'll never know!
Dialogue||That's unbelievable!
Dialogue||I don't believe that for a second.
Dialogue||Start believing XX, because it's true. If you stop by my house sometime, I could even show you my formula!
Dialogue||I can't tell if you're joking or... okay, you're serious. Wow, XX. Come on, I'm no liar.
Dialogue||Wait, I was only joking...
Dialogue||Now it sounds like you actually did!
Dialogue||Oh come on, XX. Of course I didn't! If you're feeling any kind of romance, then that's coming from you - and you can't blame me for that.
Dialogue||Not everyone has the patience for fishin'. Me, patience is all I've got.					
Dialogue||Greetings, XX. Now get out of my way.
Dialogue||I didn't mean to get in your way.
Dialogue||You seem cranky! Well, more than usual.
Dialogue||Regardless of your intent, you did it all the same. I'm busy right now with a task from my father... and I loathe being tasked with my father's demands.
Dialogue||Judge me all you want, but I have matters to tend to that go far above you. At any rate, I need not explain myself to the likes of you.[]My father has his wishes, and it's up to me to respect them no matter what. Now like I said, get out of my way.
Dialogue||What's Minos got you doing?
Dialogue||You do look a bit stressed.
Dialogue||Firstly, it's King Minos to you. Secondly, it's not of your concern. 
Dialogue||Then you should know that if there was ever a time to trifle with me, it is not now. Not that there's <i>ever</i> a time you should trifle with me.
Dialogue||Right this way, my prince.
Dialogue||That's no reason to be rude.
Dialogue||Heh, that's more like it. I'm just in a hurry, but I knew you had the wits to understand that. 
Dialogue||I might count you as something akin to a confidant, XX, but if you become a problem... well, you know the drill. Dungeon. Chains. Eternity.[]Now move aside.
Dialogue||Hm? Ah sorry XX, I've got my mind on a patient.																										
Dialogue||If you keep staring at me, I'm going to remove your ability to stare at anything.													
Dialogue||This town treats me well, and I treat it when it's not well!		
Dialogue||Oh, hey there. I'm in the middle of planning next week's practice drills, but I can spare a moment to chat.
Dialogue||Is planning the drills usually your job?
Dialogue||What kind of stuff are you planning for practice?
Dialogue||Actually, it isn't. Our itinerary is normally received from Army Headquarters in the Great City.[]Lately the headquarters has been failing to deliver, though. So I've been preparing the drills myself. It's no biggie, really.
Dialogue||Nothing out of the ordinary. Some running and conditioning exercises to keep everyone in top condition, especially when they have all their gear on.[]Staying in good physical shape isn't just part of the job for me, I think it's a good lifestyle in general.
Dialogue||Why hasn't headquarters been doing their job?
Dialogue||Are you worried about headquarters not delivering?
Dialogue||I guess they're just a lot busier than usual these days. With all the rumors going around, I don't mind picking up the extra slack. It's my job, after all.
Dialogue||Hm, not really, no. I guess they're just a lot busier than usual these days. With all the rumors going around, I don't mind picking up the extra slack. It's my job, after all.
Dialogue||You have a tough job, you need to stay fit.
Dialogue||Sounds really mundane.
Dialogue||Hey, look who I'm talking to. If anyone knows about staying active and fit for their job, it's you.
Dialogue||I'm sorry you see it like that. I thought you'd relate, being a farmer and all, but maybe not.
Dialogue||This town isn't a bad place to spend eternity!						 					
Dialogue||Hello, little farmer.[]Oh - you look sick! Could it be a lovebug?
Dialogue||What's the farthest you've traveled for work?
Dialogue||Have you found a partner for yourself?
Dialogue||I once took a boat down to the Southern Islands. Talk about a good time![]The people down there are some of the most romantic I've ever met.
Dialogue||Unfortunately, my lifestyle keeps me from setting down roots. But believe me, there have been offers!
Dialogue||I'm sure you fit right in, then.
Dialogue||They probably didn't need your help, then.
Dialogue||Oh yeah, I don't know if I've ever sold as much as I did down there. I was out of merchandise in a week!
Dialogue||Don't underestimate how good I am at my job, sweetie.
Dialogue||No surprise there!
Dialogue||Offers? Here in Sun Haven? 
Dialogue||Are you practicing your lines? Because that was a good one!
Dialogue||Well sure, just the other day... actually, I better not. Nobody likes a gossip!
Dialogue||Looking at you, I wonder if I should add farming to the soldiers' exercise regimen!
Dialogue||How are the other soldiers doing, anyway?
Dialogue||So who's the best fighter in the corps?
Dialogue||Oh, they're excelling in their exercises! Sophie is a real monster, and I mean that in a good way.[]Pinto, on the other hand... well, he's got a lot of heart!
Dialogue||I'll exclude Roza since she's an officer, so that really just leaves Sophie. In fact, I'd say she's right on Roza's tail.[]Watching the two of them spar is like watching an epic battle. Give it another year and Sophie could take Roza's title!
Dialogue||It sounds like Sophie will do well for herself in the military.
Dialogue||It sounds like Pinto has a lot of work to do...
Dialogue||Maybe, but there's more to being a leader than being good with a sword. She's still learning that part. Judging by her tenacity, she could make a great officer one day.
Dialogue||Maybe, but there's more to being a leader than being good with a sword. Judging by his morale, he could make a great officer one day.
Dialogue||I bet neither of them is on your level, though.
Dialogue||What if I told Roza you said that?
Dialogue||That's nice, but I'm actually not sure. Just because I'm the captain doesn't mean I'm the better fighter. In fact I might even bet against myself in that fight!
Dialogue||I wouldn't recommend that. She doesn't handle criticism well - it's part of what drives her to be the best.
Dialogue||I prefer to work in the café. The smell of coffee gets my brain working harder!					 																																																							
Dialogue||Hello again. You wouldn't know anything about writing a script, would you?
Dialogue||A script?
Dialogue||Are you always so hard at work?
Dialogue||That's right, for a play. I'm going to be a renowned playwright one day soon.[]Hey, you should get an autograph - that'll be worth something after I'm famous!
Dialogue||Until I finish this manuscript, I sure will be. Then again, a script is never really "finished," if you ask me.
Dialogue||You're so sure of yourself!
Dialogue||What if you don't get famous?
Dialogue||Of course! I haven't met anyone that holds up to my skill as a wordsmith. I'm a champion behind the keys of a typewriter.
Dialogue||That seems unlikely... I never really thought about it!
Dialogue||So when do you know you're done with it?
Dialogue||So you just work forever?
Dialogue||I'll know when it's done. That's part of being a writer, you need to have the instincts.
Dialogue||It's never good to rush a script. It will be done when it's done - and it will be <i>glorious!</i>
Dialogue||Darn, I just forgot what I was going to write... oh, it came back to me!						 																																																							
Dialogue||Hi, I'm Jade. You're the new farmer here?
Dialogue||That's right, I'm XX.
Dialogue||XX... Yeah, I like that name! Good to meet you.
Dialogue||I don't want to sound rude, but I'm in the zone right now. Let's talk later?						 																																																							
Dialogue||I'm working hard on a manuscript, but I don't mind a little small talk.						 																																																							
Dialogue||Heather's a good friend. She's mastered the art of small talk, which is perfect for when my writing brain needs a break.					 																																																							
Dialogue||I bet you're a creative type, too.						 																																																							
Dialogue||Farming must have its exciting moments - maybe there's a story there.			 																																																							
Dialogue||Music is my passion, any way you spin it. Heh, that's a little record joke.																																																																					
Dialogue||Claude comes in so often, I might know him best out of everyone in Sun Haven... just maybe.																																																																				
Dialogue||Hello, farmer! I hope your crops are, um, growing.
Dialogue||I'm surprised you've stayed open through these hard times.
Dialogue||What made you want to open a record store?
Dialogue||Well, what can I say? I'm careful with my money. It helps that the people of Sun Haven really appreciate their music, too.[]Matter of fact, Claude may have single-handedly kept me in business over the years.
Dialogue||I know, it's not the safest bet. I'd probably be better off opening something like...[]Aw jeez, I can't even think of another shop to open! That's just it - music is the only thing that I actually know well enough to turn it into a business.
Dialogue||It sounds like you owe Claude big time. 
Dialogue||I definitely appreciate music, too! 
Dialogue||Yeah, maybe I should thank him somehow. I guess, a record on the house? What do you get somebody who's rich, anyway?
Dialogue||Well great! Grab yourself a jukebox and some records, and you'll be ready to jam out![]Is that what people say now? "Jam out?" I should really know these things.
Dialogue||It's smart to turn your interest into a career.
Dialogue||There's nothing else you're good at?
Dialogue||Hey, thanks! I'm sure that if I tried farming like you, I'd only end up hurting myself. So you bet I'm grateful to be here!
Dialogue||Well... Man, now you put me on the spot and my mind drawing blanks.
Dialogue||I'm not cut out for the kind of work you do. I'm thankful to have this shop.																																																																				
Dialogue||Have you checked our selection lately? We have some great tunes!																																																																		
Dialogue||Hello. I don't think we've met - I'm Arvel. Welcome to my music shop.
Dialogue||Hi Arvel, I'm XX.
Dialogue||It's great to meet you. Please, take your time and find something you like.
Dialogue||When talking about the record store, sometimes I say "we," but really it's just me here.																																																																				
Dialogue||We're hoping for a shipment of new records soon. There's nothing like that new-record-smell.																																																																					
Dialogue||I love all these animals, but it's more important that they find a real home.								
Dialogue||Hey hey! Get a new best friend today!			 					
Dialogue||Can you really walk out alone??								
Dialogue||Looking for a life partner? I can help - with a pet!			 					
Dialogue||You look like a real animal lover! I'm right, aren't I?			 					
Dialogue||Come aboard, traveler. Let us embark!
Dialogue||I'm ready.
Dialogue||I'd rather wait.
Dialogue||Don't be afraid to bug me if you have any questions!			
Dialogue||Hello again, XX was it? I thought you might be back! It's great to see you again. 
Dialogue||Have you been a seamstress your whole life?
Dialogue||Are you from Withergate?
Dialogue||I learned the skill as a young girl, but it hasn't been my only occupation for my whole life. Before I found Withergate, I used to perform in a travelling circus. I was a tap dancer!
Dialogue||Nobody is really "from" Withergate, silly! Everyone just finds their way here one way or another, like how you found your way into my shop today.
Dialogue||Your act must have been outstanding!
Dialogue||The circus? That makes a lot of sense.
Dialogue||You're such a dear! And you're right, too. Nobody else dancing tap could keep up with me!
Dialogue||I wasn't there as a "freak" or anything so demeaning, you know. I have real talent on stage. Oh well, you wouldn't know talent if it waved six hands in front of your face.
Dialogue||Do you like it here?
Dialogue||Do you think you'll stay here forever?
Dialogue||Withergate is a nice enough city. I only wish it were cleaner, but that's a small price to pay for a place where all monsterfolk can live peacefully. There's no place in the world like Withergate!
Dialogue||Nice of you to drop in!
Dialogue||Looking for a new look? Look no further!
Dialogue||You're such a cutie! I'm glad to have you in my web.
Dialogue||Don't be afraid to come right up to the counter, sweetie.
Dialogue||I thought I felt somebody bouncing on my web out there! Welcome to my shop, traveler, I hope you find something you like. Everything you see is handmade by me!
Dialogue||Good to meet you, my name is XX.
Dialogue||Well hello, XX. My name is Arianella. I'm the only silk-spinning seamstress you'll find in Withergate. I'm so very happy to have you here!
Dialogue||Nobody spins silk as fast as me.
Dialogue||<b>Between the three of us, I'm the most knowledgable.</b>[]<i>But I'mmmm the mosssst charrrrming.</i>										
Dialogue||We can give you the finest tips on hats.[]<i>And the finesssst hats to tip.</i>										
Dialogue||Welcome![]<b>Welcome.</b>[]<i>Wellllcome...</i>
Dialogue||Hi... and hi, and hi. My name is XX!
Dialogue||<b>XX, a strong name.</b>[]You can call us Triberius. Welcome to our haberdashery![]<i>Oh, just say "hat shop" for goodnessss sake...</i>[]<b>It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance.</b>
Dialogue||Take a look around and let us know if you need a hand.[]<b>Or six!</b>											
Dialogue||<i>We can accomplish many thingssss when we put our headssss together.</i>[]She tells that joke to every new customer.											
Dialogue||A fine traveler like yourself should have a distinguished look.[]<b>And there's nothing more distinguished than a quality hat, wouldn't you say?</b>										
Dialogue||So you've returned! Care to try on some of our wares?[]<i>Yessss, try something onnnn.</i>[]<b>Or are you looking for a spot of conversation?</b>
Dialogue||Triberius, did you get into the hat business because...
Dialogue||I have to ask, were you born this way?
Dialogue||<b>Because we have three heads? Haha!</b>[]Don't mind him, he lives to make people uncomfortable. Actually, we started making hats to raise enough money to buy a new home.[]<i>But then we heard about Withergate and it sounded like jusssst the place for ussss.</i>[]Since we already knew how to make hats, we opened a haberdashery![]<b>Really, nobody knows what a haberdashery is. Please, just say "hat shop!"</b>
Dialogue||As a matter of fact, we were changed this way by a dark wizard. There was a time when we were three separate creatures.[]<i>The dark wizzzzard, he made us like thissss to guard his storeroom of pricelessss scrollssss. He chained ussss up at the entrancccce, but nobody ever came to ssssteal them.</i>[]<b>Indeed, we became quite bored by the task.</b>[]So we broke our bonds and escaped to make our own life.
Dialogue||You three seem to bicker quite a bit.
Dialogue||Are you all angry at each other?
Dialogue||What do you expect? We're stuck with each other constantly, all the time, forever![]<b>There's bound to be a little conflict.</b>
Dialogue||<i>Nonsensssse. A little argument is part of the ffffun.</i>[]<b>It's true, we fight with each other merely for fun. It may be juvenile, but it keeps us entertained.</b>
Dialogue||That's terrible, I'm sorry.
Dialogue||At least you have each other.
Dialogue||<i>It'ssss not so bad.</i>[]<b>Yes, we've become quite used to each other by now.</b>
Dialogue||<i>That'ssss exactly how we see it.</i>[]We've decided to stay positive about the situation.[]<b>I'm proud to be stuck together with such fine creatures.</b>
Dialogue||<i>We make evvvvery hat by hannnnd.</i>[]<b>You won't find better quality anywhere else.</b>											
Dialogue||Sprich mit mir, wenn du diese Samen gepflanzt und Holz gesammelt hast!
Dialogue||I'm almost out of debt, you know. If I can do it, anyone can!						 					
Dialogue||I don't mind working long hours. It's going long hours without eating that really hits me.						 					
Dialogue||You do what you have to and that's how you get by.						 					
Dialogue||One day, all my work will pay off.						 					
Dialogue||Withergate? I'm too busy to worry about monsters.						 					
Dialogue||My son will bring Withergate over the horizon. Monsterfolk will take their rightful place in the world.																																																																			
Dialogue||Are you intimidated, little one? BWAHAHAH!																																																																			
Dialogue||You're in the presence of a king. Be sure you don't forget yourself.[]Now, what brings you before me?
Dialogue||I'm curious about Withergate's history, my king.
Dialogue||I want to add to Withergate's prosperity, my king.
Dialogue||Before Withergate was made a city, only Withergate Castle stood on this land. With the strength of my father, my son, and myself, Withergate Castle was pulled out of the very ground.[]Soon after I took the throne, I knew it was time to spread my family's influence. I established Withergate City below the castle as a means of increasing my family's power. 
Dialogue||I see... very good. I understand that you are a farmer in your Human town. Certainly you can use your experience raising crops to increase our bounty.[]The apartments have farmable space on the rooftop where you can work. Xyla's genius idea, of course.
Dialogue||I thought you made Withergate to unify monsterfolk.
Dialogue||How did the monsterfolk come to be here?
Dialogue||At the time of Withergate's founding, there was indeed rising conflict among the monsterfolk. The unrest was a convenient problem, one that I was well-equipped to solve.[]All the monsterfolk really needed was a call for unity from a powerful leader, and the enticing promise of everlasting darkness.
Dialogue||There was rising conflict among the monsterfolk at the time of Withergate's founding. The unrest was a convenient problem, one that I was well-equipped to solve.[]All the monsterfolk really needed was a call for unity from a powerful leader, and the enticing promise of everlasting darkness.
Dialogue||Do you really think that will help much?
Dialogue||I'm happy to contribute however I can.
Dialogue||Questioning me is brash, outsider. Too brash. If you continue to slip up, I will let you rot in darkness for the rest of your miserable life.
Dialogue||You act like a true citizen of our beautiful city. Many are here only to live, not to help. If I'm to build a future for Demons and monsterfolk alike, then I'll need citizens like you.
Dialogue||Every Demon in the world will know the sweet taste of Withergate's prosperity, one day...																																																																			
Dialogue||Ah, my newest citizen. What brings you before me today?
Dialogue||I want to know your family's history, my king.
Dialogue||My king, who is your most trusted advisor here?
Dialogue||My bloodline goes back one thousand years. I haven't enough time to give you a complete history, so I will tell you about my father.[]My father, the king before me, was Aster. The Demon King Aster created Withergate Castle as a home for all demonkind. All that recognized my family's supremacy, that is.
Dialogue||Hm? I'm surprised you feel the need to ask. Surely you know that my son, Darius, acts as one of my advisors. I trust him over all others. Blood is thicker than water, you know.
Dialogue||Was he a good king?
Dialogue||He must have been a mighty ruler.
Dialogue||You <i>dare</i> suggest that my father was an unfit leader? Like all in my bloodline, he was born to lead peons such as yourself.[]Next time, you will be sure to remember whose castle you're polluting with your insults.
Dialogue||Indeed. His wisdom and fearless leadership kept the Demons of Withergate Castle comfortable, safe, and happy.
Dialogue||Then who's your most trusted advisor, not counting Darius?
Dialogue||Does Darius do that good of a job?
Dialogue||That's Prince Darius to you, peasant. Show some respect in my throne room.[]Other than Darius, I must choose Cordelia. Xyla has an enthusiasm and power that is valuable and rare, but she is too unpredictably wild. A king needs reliability on his council. 
Dialogue||That's Prince Darius to you, peasant. Show some respect in my throne room.[]My son may not do the work of Cordelia or Xyla, but that is only because he carries the burden of royalty. Royalty has work done for them, not by them.
Dialogue||Once again, you come before me. I hope you're here with purpose and not only to waste my time.
Dialogue||My king, where is the rest of your family?
Dialogue||What are your plans for Withergate, my king?
Dialogue||Ah... You're curious about the queen. I suppose if you want to be a true citizen, then you should know the story. There was a battle, on this very land.[]Darius was a mere child and my father was still king. I, the prince, was already long married to my queen-to-be, Aisling.[]At that time the castle was not yet erected and we had only camps to live in. Then we fell under attack by a clan of Naga who wanted our land.[]My Aisling fought fiercely, but was struck down.
Dialogue||Withergate City is my legacy to Darius. My plan is to make this city as grand and prosperous as possible. Then, when my son takes the throne, he will have the advantage of a city behind his rule.
Dialogue||What did you do?
Dialogue||I'm sorry for your loss.
Dialogue||It was after losing Aisling that my father decided to make the castle. It was that same night that he, with help from Darius and me, brought Withergate Castle into being.
Dialogue||That is kind of you to say. It was after losing Aisling that my father decided to make the castle. It was that same night that he, with help from Darius and me, brought Withergate Castle into being.
Dialogue||It sounds like your plan is to do nothing new.
Dialogue||Giving your son a strong start is a great idea.
Dialogue||As far as I know, Cordelia is my personal strategist. I will always be grateful for her advice, but a peasant like you has no right to criticise my plans for this city.
Dialogue||Indeed, it was Cordelia's idea to bide my time and make Withergate as great as it can be. She's a valuable strategist and a large part of Withergate's success.
Dialogue||If you wish to be one of us, you must prove your worth.																																																																			
Dialogue||Withergate Castle is my father's legacy. Withergate City will be mine.			 																																																																
Dialogue||I got nothing to say!
Dialogue||Just cast your line and wait for the right moment. Patience is key!
Dialogue||Well don't just stand there - there's work to do.
Dialogue||My seeds only grow in the dark, you know.																																																																			
Dialogue||I need capable sailors to join my fleet. Let me know if you see any!																																																																		
Dialogue||This permanent darkness... I'm still not quite used to that.																																																																					
Dialogue||Withergate is the perfect place for my business. I guess you could say I've put down roots here!																																																																						
Dialogue||In a way, Withergate reminds me of the coral reefs in the ocean. So many different people in such a small area!
Dialogue||Aren't you a Mermaid?
Dialogue||Why aren't you in the ocean right now?
Dialogue||What gave it away?[]I'm joking! Hehe, I must be the first Mermaid you've ever met. I'm not surprised - we're a very private type of people.
Dialogue||Hehe, I guess you would be curious about that. I ended up here by accident, actually.[]I got swept up in an unexpected current and it carried me to this river right here. When I saw where I was - a big city with glittering lights and new people to meet - how could I leave?
Dialogue||So not all mermaids are as friendly as you?
Dialogue||With tails like that, it's no wonder your people stay in the ocean.
Dialogue||Aw, thanks! I suppose I do stand out from the rest of the Mermaids. I've always been interested in strangers, but most Mermaids hide from strangers to protect our people.
Dialogue||Not all of us do. Some Mermaids go on great adventures! I'm evidence of that, aren't I?
Dialogue||So you're just staying here, then?
Dialogue||Don't you miss your home?
Dialogue||Well I'm sure I'll go home sometime, but for now I want to enjoy the city. It's good to have some new experiences, you know?[]Plus, there's a prize at the carnival that I've been trying to win for weeks now!
Dialogue||I'm sure my home will still be there when I get back. Our reefs are protected by powerful Elementals. Oh, I wonder if they've been looking for me...
Dialogue||Aren't you so cute!																																																																						
Dialogue||Can you feel this city's energy? It's electrifying!																																																																						
Dialogue||The monsterfolk here are endlessly resourceful. I never know what to expect from them.																																																			
Dialogue||You have to be careful with these seeds. You can't just plant them anywhere, you know.																																																																						
Dialogue||Keep walkin'.								
Dialogue||Don't hesitate to ask for help, now.																																																																									
Dialogue||So you managed to find your way into town after all?[]I saw you walking through the fog earlier. I'm Faeyon Tarrin, but you may call me Faeyon.
Dialogue||Good to meet you Faeyon. I'm XX.
Dialogue||XX, welcome to Withergate. This city is an oddity, as you'll see. I'm curious to know how you'll get along here.
Dialogue||Withergate is the perfect place to practice reading the stars.																																																																			
Dialogue||We could use more of your type in this city.						 																																																																
Dialogue||You don't look like a local. You must be a tourist!																																																																						
Dialogue||Quit starin' at me or I'll be the last thing you ever see.								
Dialogue||I'm busy kid, move it or lose it.								
Dialogue||You're not allergic to pollen, are you?																																																																						
Dialogue||Because surely you're wondering - yes, I am <i>that</i> Eris Umbra.
Dialogue||I've never heard of you before
Dialogue||What's a pirate like yourself doing in a city like this?
Dialogue||Say again? Never, not even once? My reputation must be slipping... which is a good thing, I suppose.[]All you need to know about me is that I'm the richest pirate at sea. And since riches are the key to freedom, you could say I'm the most free pirate, too!
Dialogue||I've been hiding out here for nearly a month now, trying to keep a low profile.[]It seems like it's been working so far. I haven't met a single person who knew my name! It's a little insulting, actually.
Dialogue||It sounds nice to sail free across the sea.
Dialogue||But you're not at sea.
Dialogue||It's the best feeling in the world, let me tell you. It will be even better when I have my own fleet behind me... one day.
Dialogue||Har har, you know what I mean. I'm no stickler for wordplay.
Dialogue||Are you in some kind of danger?
Dialogue||I only need to remain hidden. Four years ago, I abandoned my role as a noble in a far-off region. In fact, I was the queen's chief advisor until rebels stormed the castle.[]Queen Mayaria let herself get caught so that I could escape. In my heart, I am still loyal to her.
Dialogue||I need to remain hidden because I abandoned my role as a noble in a far-off region. That was four years ago. In fact, I was the queen's chief advisor until rebels stormed the castle.[]Queen Mayaria let herself get caught so that I could escape. In my heart, I am still loyal to her.
Dialogue||Hm? Help you with somethin'?
Dialogue||My name's XX, nice to meet you!
Dialogue||Huh? What do I care?
Dialogue||There are some nice beaches by that Human town, Sun Haven. The sand is so soft!																																																																			
Dialogue||Who let you into this town, runt?								
Dialogue||What do you want, shrimp? 
Dialogue||Do you have to be rude?
Dialogue||What's your name?
Dialogue||Don't have to be. Wanna be.
Dialogue||What's it to you?
Dialogue||What kind of person wants to be rude?
Dialogue||I can tell you're pretty tough.
Dialogue||The kind I wanna be. Why, what kind of weakling do you wanna be?
Dialogue||Pretty tough? You don't know the half of it, kid.
Dialogue||I was just asking... 
Dialogue||I want to get to know you better. 
Dialogue||Fine. It's Dwayne. Now you know, so you can go. 
Dialogue||Ugh... Sorry pal, not interested.
Dialogue||There's no place in the world I wouldn't set anchor and explore.																																																																				
Dialogue||Who do you think you are, anyway?								
Dialogue||You must be wondering, "What's an Angel doing here?"[]As a Watcher, it's my mission to observe the world and its activity. Especially in places like this.
Dialogue||What's a "Watcher?"
Dialogue||What did you mean when you said "places like this?"
Dialogue||To some degree, all Angels are sworn Watchers. We record the history of the world without altering it ourselves.[]Think of us merely as historians. But even so, I find that I can at least give a little help to vulnerable people, like some of the citizens here.
Dialogue||Withergate is still relatively new as a city. It's too early to tell what will become of it. From what I've seen over the past few years, though, anything can happen here.
Dialogue||You should help whenever you can.
Dialogue||Upholding tradition is important.
Dialogue||In my heart, I agree. But my cultural oath demands that I stay impartial.[]I suppose the task of protecting the weak falls on the shoulders of righteous adventurers like yourself!
Dialogue||Yes, but I still wish I could help more directly. I envy your kind - those not tethered to the laws of your culture.
Dialogue||Why do you think anything could happen here?
Dialogue||You've been here for years?
Dialogue||This city is full of monsterfolk from all over the world. Monsterfolk aren't all that dangerous, but they can be unpredictable.[]Just look at what they've done in one short decade - the lights, the buildings... it's unlike anything I've ever seen.
Dialogue||Yes I have. It doesn't feel that long to an experienced watcher - we are trained to withstand the passing of time. We have to stay sharp if we're to be impartial observers, after all.
Dialogue||My tail is getting dry...																																																																					
Dialogue||If you spot an X on the ground, just ignore it!																																																																				
Dialogue||You came here through the sewer? Yuck! Why not just use the river?																																																																						
Dialogue||Hoy! My name's Eris Umbra. What do you call yourself?
Dialogue||My name is XX.
Dialogue||XX, I have to tell you something - you smell worse than a barrel of fish left in the sun. Did you think it a good idea, coming in through the sewer?
Dialogue||One day I'll come out of hiding and return Queen Mayaria to her rightful throne.																																																																	
Dialogue||If you're not goin' in, get lost.			 					
Dialogue||Angels have pledged themselves to the betterment of all races. You know, I peek in on Sun Haven from time to time too!																																																																			
Dialogue||I haven't seen you here before. Of course, I usually have my eyes on the water.[]You have a kind face. I'm Honey, nice to meet you!
Dialogue||Hello Honey, my name is XX.
Dialogue||It's my pleasure to meet you, XX. I'll see you around town for sure!
Dialogue||Angelkind aren't usually the type for combat - I guess I'm just not like the other Angels.																																																																			
Dialogue||I can really move when I'm underwater! On land, not so much.																																																																						
Dialogue||You again... Is this gonna be a regular thing?			 					
Dialogue||Hey there! Nice to see a new face in town. Call me Christine.
Dialogue||My name's XX!
Dialogue||What a fun name! Well I hope you're looking for seeds, XX. I've got plenty!
Dialogue||The open ocean is exhilarating... but dangerous.																																																																				
Dialogue||Look who's here! Good to see you again, dear. 
Dialogue||Where do you come from?
Dialogue||Have you lived here long?
Dialogue||I propagated in a forest inhabited by Elves. Can you believe it? I had to travel quite a ways to get here, and that's not easy on roots!
Dialogue||Actually, I only arrived a few weeks ago. But already this city has charmed me! I plan to stick around, don't you worry.
Dialogue||You didn't like the forest? 
Dialogue||It seems like a forest would be the perfect place for you. 
Dialogue||Oh no, I loved that forest. I only outgrew it is all. There's not much to do in the forest, so I suppose I was looking for a little excitement!
Dialogue||Sure, it was nice growing up there. Warm, safe, sweet-scented. Like myself![]I only outgrew it is all. There's not much to do in the forest, so I suppose I was looking for a little excitement!
Dialogue||I wasn't worried.
Dialogue||I'm glad you decided to stay.
Dialogue||Oh, well yes that's obvious. You don't need to be so direct about it, though.
Dialogue||I simply had to. Withergate is perfect for my business. Not many other places you find never ending darkness!
Dialogue||I'm glad it's so dark here. Otherwise, I might dry up.																																																																					
Dialogue||I was taught that the strong watch over the vulnerable. Though, I'm not quite sure if that's how it works here.																																																								
Dialogue||Don't fight up close, keep your distance. You can't lose a fight if your opponent can't touch you.								
Dialogue||Are you just visiting, or are you going to look at our wares?														
Dialogue||Welcome back, traveler. Enjoying the fruits of Nel'Vari? Or, is this about business?
Dialogue||Where did you learn to make crossbows?
Dialogue||What's the best crossbow you've got?
Dialogue||I've been making crossbows since I was a young boy. Back then, they were hardly more than sticks and twine, but I assure you I've improved my craft.
Dialogue||That's my Mark, easily. I call it that because it hasn't missed a target yet. It's more of a relic now, though. Haven't needed to use that one in some time.
Dialogue||I can see that - I can't wait to try one out!
Dialogue||I'll believe it when I see it.
Dialogue||Heh, I see you appreciate quality gear. That makes sense for a traveler. And yet, you strike me as more than the average adventuring-type.[]Anyway, I'm happy to help you however I can. Maybe one day you can help me out, too.
Dialogue||All right, don't take me at my word then. The evidence is right in front of you.
Dialogue||You don't use it anymore?
Dialogue||I used to fall into some dangerous work, in a previous lifetime. My Mark made a bit of a reputation for itself in my travels.[]Heck, most people knew of "Rel'Tar's Mark" before they even knew me!
Dialogue||I only use the Mark when necessary. I used to fall into some dangerous work, in a previous lifetime. My Mark made a bit of a reputation for itself in my travels.[]Heck, most people knew of "Rel'Tar's Mark" before they even knew me!
Dialogue||Who's that? A new face in Nel'Vari, eh? Maybe you'd like to look at some of my friends here - don't worry, they don't bite!
Dialogue||I'm XX. What's your name?
Dialogue||My name is Clemmett! I run the mount shop here, keeping an eye on these beauties all day, every day.
Dialogue||Come on over, friend. Take a look.								
Dialogue||The finest capes made from the finest silk. I harvest it myself from wild centipillars and spider webs.										
Dialogue||Hm? Oh, hello. My name is Tornn, I sell capes here.
Dialogue||Hi Tornn, my name is XX. It's good to meet you.
Dialogue||Likewise, traveler.
Dialogue||Are you looking for a partner to take on adventures? Your search could end here!			 					
Dialogue||Everything you see here was fashioned by my brother or me.											
Dialogue||Have you ever seen Elven craftsmanship up close? You can really feel the difference. Go ahead, feel it!											
Dialogue||Sylvia thinks she's the superior woodworker, but I know better.											
Dialogue||I'm proud of the craftsmanship I put into each one of my crossbows. You'll feel the difference when you hold one, I guarantee it.								
Dialogue||You look pretty stylish, but one of my capes would really pull your look together.								
Dialogue||Sylvius thinks he's the superior woodworker, but I know better.								
Dialogue||Take a look, don't be shy!																	
Dialogue||You strike me as a marksman. You've a sharp look in your eye.																																																																		
Dialogue||I hope you're appreciating Nel'Vari, because not many strangers have the privilege of seeing our village.											
Dialogue||Don't forget to buy yourself a whistle so you can call your mount from a distance!											
Dialogue||My people are protective, but not inhospitable. You're certainly welcome here.											
Dialogue||I'm happy to answer any questions!						 					
Dialogue||Only the finest craftsmanship - Elven craftsmanship.											
Dialogue||I bet some Elven furnishings would really make your home stand out.									 					
Dialogue||Welcome! Come to see the world's finest craftsmanship?
Dialogue||What makes this the world's finest?
Dialogue||What a cute deer!
Dialogue||Nobody compares to Elves when it comes to woodcraft, don't you know?
Dialogue||That's Telumbe, he's really smart. He knows the way back home to Nel'Vari by heart.
Dialogue||I'm surprised to see such skill from Elves as young as you.
Dialogue||It's because you live in the forest, right?
Dialogue||Just because we're young doesn't mean we aren't skilled! Why does everyone make that assumption?
Dialogue||Sort of. We have a connection with trees, so we understand the wood better than anyone else.
Dialogue||Can I pet him?  
Dialogue||He sounds like a one-of-a-kind animal. 
Dialogue||Sorry, I should get back to work and help Sylvius. He will get mad if I leave him alone too long - he's definitely the baby brother.
Dialogue||He really is! Anyway, I should get back to work. Sylvius will get mad if I leave him alone too long - he's definitely the baby brother.
Dialogue||Hi, I'm Sylvius. My sister and I are the best merchants out of Nel'Vari. 
Dialogue||Hi there, my name's XX.
Dialogue||Heh, funny name.[]Wait, are you the one who figured out the Nel'Vari puzzle? Color me impressed!
Dialogue||Partake in our goods while you can!								
Dialogue||It's a gorgeous day in Nel'Vari... the animals always relax when the weather turns nice.							
Dialogue||Elves are linked with nature, which is why we excel at woodwork. Can't you tell?											
Dialogue||I remember you, you're XX. Did you come looking for a cape, or just some conversation?
Dialogue||Do you make the capes yourself?
Dialogue||Have you always been a cape salesman?
Dialogue||From the finest silk I can forage, that's right. Of course I'm careful to make sure any spider webs are empty before I collect them. I don't want to steal anybody's home.
Dialogue||I used to do some jobs with Rel'Tar, but we've retired from that work now. I much prefer the peace and quiet of Nel'Vari to the action that goes on outside of the forest here.
Dialogue||You really care about the forest.
Dialogue||They're just spiders.
Dialogue||Spiders are a crucial part of the food chain, just like everything else. That might seem thoughtful to you, but for Elves it's a simple fact of life.
Dialogue||That shows how much you care about the forest, then. Spiders are a crucial part of the food chain.
Dialogue||Who were the jobs for?
Dialogue||It sounds like you were doing dangerous work.
Dialogue||We charged a hefty sum for our skills, since the work was often dangerous. So we were mostly hired by officials from other cities since they were the only ones who could afford us.[]I can tell you're curious, so I'll say right up front that I don't care to dwell on those times. But I'll say this one thing about it - at the end of the day, all we did was help people. 
Dialogue||You're right about the work being dangerous, but I really don't care to dwell on those times.[]I can tell you're curious. I'll say this one thing about it - at the end of the day, all we did was help people. 
Dialogue||Huh? No no, it's <i>Clemmett</i> with a "C-L" in front.										
Dialogue||Well-met, traveler. My name is Rel'Tar. I sell handcrafted crossbows, so if you're looking for arms then you've come to the right place.
Dialogue||Welcome to our village. It is rather impressive that you found your way here, I have to say.
Dialogue||Hello, traveler. Long way from home, huh?								
Dialogue||Your search for the best woodworking has ended. What can I get you?
Dialogue||Is it difficult selling your goods here?
Dialogue||You mean in Nel'Vari? Sure, it's tricky selling wooden goods in a town full of woodworkers. The key is to exceed in quality.
Dialogue||His name is Telumbe, and he's the best! He's been in our family a long time. I think he's older than Sylvia and I combined.
Dialogue||You must really be the best in town, then.
Dialogue||How did you become such a fine artisan?
Dialogue||You bet! Between Sylvia and me, there's not an Elf in the world that holds a candle to our skill.
Dialogue||Practice, practice, practice. All I've done since I was a kid is carve wood. Sometimes it's like I can hear the wood, telling me how to shape it.
Dialogue||Doesn't Telumbe get tired pulling the cart?
Dialogue||It sounds like Telumbe is a perfect companion for you.
Dialogue||Telumbe could pull 10 of these. Don't underestimate him just because he's old.
Dialogue||He really is! Animals are crucial to our way of life, so they become our family.
Dialogue||I used to travel the world like you, but my adventuring days are over. For now.								
Dialogue||Why capes? They're useful and stylish, so there's no downside to a cape.											
Dialogue||Hello! I'm Sylvia, merchant of Elven goods.
Dialogue||Hi Sylvia, I'm XX.
Dialogue||XX? What a curious name![]Hold on, you're the one who figured out the Nel'Vari puzzle! That's really impressive.
Dialogue||We don't come around every day, you know!											
Dialogue||How's your aim? Just keep practicing.			 					
Dialogue||Taking care of these critters is a full-time job, but it's worth the effort if they find a good home.					 					
Dialogue||It's my dream to make a beautiful cape for Nivara... but I would need so much silk, I don't know if it's possible.										
Dialogue||Hey again, welcome back! Something I can do for you, XX?
Dialogue||How did you end up in Nel'Vari?
Dialogue||Where do you find these animals?
Dialogue||Ah, you noticed that I'm not an Elf! I guess no matter how hard I try, I'll never blend in.[]As much as I wish I were an Elf, I'm Amari. I've lived in this forest for years and years, so it was only a matter of time before I found my way into Nel'Vari.
Dialogue||You're talking about my mounts? I only bring them here if I find them in need of help. The White Lion I found injured in a hunter's net, and the griffon I saved from a river.[]I think that's why I was welcomed into Nel'Vari in the first place. Someone must be keeping an eye on the forests around here!
Dialogue||Why do you want to be an Elf?
Dialogue||The Elves welcomed you, too?
Dialogue||Life as an Elf seems peaceful. Living as an Amari in the forest is too dangerous these days. I just want a group of friends behind me is all.
Dialogue||Sure they did! The Elves are too considerate to kick me out. Besides, I have this job set up now. I'm basically a local, even if nobody else says so.
Dialogue||You deserve to be part of this village, Clemmett.
Dialogue||Shouldn't you set them free after they recover?
Dialogue||Aw, thanks XX. Now if only I could get the Elder to say the same thing...
Dialogue||I can't believe you think I would hold them against their will! They all decided to stay on their own. Any one of them can leave whenever they want!
Dialogue||I care for these animals as best I can, but there's no replacement for a real home.								
Dialogue||You won't find goods like these anywhere else.											
Dialogue||Talk to me when you've planted those seeds and gathered some wood!
