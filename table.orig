- You can now talk to Bernard to get divorced after marriage.

I'm looking for a favor for my sister Emma - she just heard about <color=#39CCFF>iron ore</color> and is really curious... for some reason. She really just wants to see some. Can someone bring 5 <color=#39CCFF>iron ore</color>? You can deliver it straight to her, I bet that would make her happy. Thanks!

Dear XX,
Since you've been kind to me lately, I hoped I could trust you with a request. I'm looking for a new record, but the record store owner has been talking to me... a lot. I'd rather not see him today. Will you pick up a record and bring it to my home? I'm looking for something like a <b>waltz</b>. I've enclosed 500 gold to cover the cost. I'll pay you 500 gold for the delivery. Thanks in advance.

Howdy Farmer,
You're working hard, I can see it in your wallet - I'm kidding! But I can tell that you've been getting more confidence to you, which commendable. Now I don't do handouts but I can appreciate another small business owner. Consider this a loan. Pay me back by shopping at my store sometime.
- Anne
Hey XX,
Well, color me impressed! Not only am I invested in your farm's growth, but also in how well you invest your money back into the business. You're a skilled farmer and business owner! It's been a while since I've seen someone with your dedication and generosity, and I guess it struck a chord with me. Now is my time to be generous to you, just this once. It's my favorite, so don't waste it - Raspberry Cheesecake on a Diamond Platter.
To Farmer XX,
I'm Bernard, administrator at Sun Haven's Town Hall. I wanted to reach out with this housewarming gift as a representative of Sun Haven. I hope it helps you get settled on your new land. 
Come visit me at Town Hall to the south of Sun Haven's town square if you would like to build a barn for livestock. I can also authorize renovations to your old cabin with a <color=#39CCFF>house upgrade kit</color>.
Regards,
Hello XX,
When I have Greenroot, I always find there is a hop in my step. Since you have been working so hard on your farm, I thought you could use that extra hop as well.
You simply must try it!
- Catherine
I was restocking at my shop and it seems I had a handful of extra Cinaberry Seeds. When I saw them, I knew they matched your red aura and were meant for you. Please enjoy them and continue to glow!
I want to welcome you to Sun Haven. Unlike even my most trusty bass, I have yet to find you out of tune. I'm curious what kind of song you will conduct in Sun Haven. You appear truly unique, but we will only know once we get to the bridge of your piece.
I do hope your farm is prosperous here. Perhaps I could even get to know you further.
I have traveled for years and heard songs from across the world that simply did not inspire me, but never has something spurred my creativity as much as yourself. From melody to chorus, you are entirely one of a kind.
Continue to play your song, I cannot wait to hear it.
Outsider,
I am not going to pursue you as Xyla would, but I do think you have much to prove if you wish to be a true part of Withergate. So take these and show me you have some value to my family's kingdom. I do demand a cut of your crop, so bring me a Kraken Kale as thanks for my generosity.
- Darius
I must admit, you are making waves in my court. Be careful not to undermine me or I will lock you in my dungeon for daring to act against the prince of Withergate without a second thought. I suppose, however, that you are finally earning some right to my presence and a place amongst my subjects, and dare I say, peers. You've earned my respect and for that, so I offer a single gift. Do not expect this to happen again.
Heyo XX,
Nice to get to stretch the old brain muscles and write a letter. Do you know how rare it is for me to do this? Mainly since Manhole #3 doesn't count as a valid return address. Lucky for me though, I could just borrow Darius's address. I'm sure they won't notice. Anyway! I was just coming up to get some grub and this guy just hands me a bone. Can you believe it! These suckers are like candy for an Amari like me. As much as I wanted to chew through it right away, I thought you might like it more. So give it a try!
- Donovan
Woof right, it's been a bit crazy since you came to Withergate. Your spice is exactly what this boring town needs, though. So thanks for that, making this place feel like home even though I am technically not supposed to be near the city right now due to... *ahem* circumstances. 
Well XX, you did it! You got me liking human culture all over again. Jeez. Good thing you're cute or you would've gotten some real pushback.
I don't usually send mail outside of Nel'Vari, but I simply had to show you this remarkable basket of Blueberries I picked. I managed to get the tree to replenish in only a single hour!
P.S. You are allowed to eat it, please enjoy my work.
- Iris
Our conversations inspired me to take a moment's rest and work on this furniture piece that I'd put off for far too long. I like how it turned out, so I wanted to show you what your encouragement helped me create.
P.S. I included some of my babies along with it, water them well!
Dearest XX,
I was walking Topi and Pod home from school yesterday when my mind began to wander. I was so lost in thought, I wandered myself right into an apple tree! It was funny in the moment though, plus I ended up with a surplus of apples. Please, enjoy these apples!
- Jun
I find the best way to relax after a long and heart-filled session is to paint.
While working on this piece, I realized I was thinking of you. So, I want you to have this and remember to take a moment to appreciate the small things in life. Like a painting.

Hiya XX!
I saw the cuuutest plushie on my way from the pet store today. It looks JUST like you and I NEEDED to show you! Isn't it so cute, nya!?
- Kitty
You're always a very very nice person to me. You actually listen to me and hang out with me which is suuuper fun! So I wanted to get you something to say I was thinking of mew! Get it?? Teehee!
Hello there XX,
I was making some cookies to celebrate Elizabeth's school project (she got a SUPER! sticker), and I might have gone a little overboard. We had way too many and the shop was closed so I guess I thought hey, XX may like them.
So here’s a few treats, for you! I hope you like them!
P.S. You don't have to eat them if you don't like them.
Hi XX,
You have really helped me fully settle in here and you were supposed to be the new neighbor! So I thought, it was about time I bring you a housewarming gift. Except I couldn't find time to actually bring it to you, so I am sending it to you. I hope that is okay!
Thank you for being such a good friend and your support means a lot... and you know... Welcome to Sun Haven, I couldn't imagine the town without you!
I wanted to stop by to see how you were settling in, but I saw you were busy at work with a real fire in your eyes. Instead, I am writing you this letter to commend your hard work.
To thank you for your diligent work, I've included a small gift of Greenroot seeds. It may also be one of my favorites, I would not be opposed if you want to share!
- Lucia
You have continued to grow and change since coming to Sun Haven. To think you were also blessed by Elios makes us far closer to each other than anyone could imagine.
As a token of my admiration for someone as powerfully blessed as yourself, enjoy these mana tomes. I find they help me hone my mana just in time for training in the evening.
Hi there XX!
I know you're busy settling in still, but I noticed you were a little light on armor when you were headed to the forest. I was a bit worried about you, so I thought these would help get you started on some strong armor!
Stay Safe!
- Lynn
I saw your blade was looking a little dull, be sure to keep your sword sharp! I would be devastated to know a monster in the forest managed to hurt you because of a faulty weapon when I could have been there to help fix it!
Stay Sharp!
I heard about your skill from Roza as to how well you handle yourself in combat. You're very impressive with a sword, so I hear. So, you should come by the barracks sometime! I would enjoy the recruits seeing a true natural in action. Maybe I can offer a few pointers myself.
- Nathaniel
You missed joining in for a grand supper the last night, everyone in the barracks brought a dish! It was a true family-style potluck, one that I missed from when I was a rookie under my mother's command.
While you may not be a part of the guard, I do consider you a part of our family, XX. Join us next time! We would be glad to have you - if you bring a dish of your own of course!
Look here XX,
I was stocking up on odds and ends, and this shipment of records came in scratched. (That's what I get for buying in bulk!) Turns out this is my favorite song, so consider it a free sample for the wares I have at my store.
I was cooking dinner yesterday and I realized just how soothing this song was after stirring my cauldron all day. It is one of my favorites, so I hope it brings you a little peace as well.
- Catherine						
In my days, I have spent much time alone working on music. Yet, I have only ever finished a single song that I liked. Though I dislike sharing it and have gone to great lengths to prevent those here from finding my records, you listened to my songs - unfinished or only barely started - with a smile. I feel like I can give this to you with the confidence you will enjoy it without judgment.
Human culture has always been lesser than that of the Demons. When we began the construction of Withergate City, musicians from across the land dared to present their music to my father and me. This is a recording of the best musicians to ever grace this world. Listen to it and perhaps you will begin to understand the true value of Withergate's culture.
I was sliding back down my ladder after helping this slime dude find his lost keys, and I had to pause - this great tune was playing on my record player! So in that moment I decided you need a copy. I mean, if I can jam out down in the sewers then you should be able to jam out wherever you want.
I spoke with Nivara today and she explained how much she much loved the tune of the birds. It was only then I realized how much I enjoy the music in my workshop and how it inspires me to work even harder. So I wish for you to have a copy of the song I like so much.
P.S. I hope it inspires your productivity on the farm.
I find meditating in the morning to be a good mindfulness practice. As I was enjoying my meditative trance, I found myself humming along to my music without thinking about it. You should give it a listen, I think you will enjoy the mellowing effect it has.
I so so LOVE this song and I needed you to hear it. So take a listen and fall in love with it, just like Kitty. It makes me wanna get up and shake my tail, nya!
Hi there XX,
During our session today, Jun reminded me that sometimes it's good to take a step back and relax. So I took today to listen to my favorite song. In a way, it was kind of stressful to take a whole day just to myself.
So you too. I mean you should too. Take a day... to listen to music you like.
I am going to sign this before I make it a complete disaster.
I was working late last night, finishing off a few of my Archmage duties which followed me home. I quite like to listen to music as I work, and I think you would as well. So please accept this gift, my favorite song to listen to. Perhaps it will be yours as well.
I wanted to thank you for spending so much time with me lately and making me feel welcome to Sun Haven. You may remember this song, I hum it when I tinker and I sing it when I walk, oh that is embarrassing to think about. I hope no one heard me on my walk...
Well, I really like the song and I want you to enjoy it as much as I do.
Enjoy!
Have you ever thought of battle like a dance? With every step and slash of your sword, you move in unison like making your own dance. The further you practice, the further you can perfect each movement.
So please, take this record. If you listen to it while you practice, it will be as though we are dancing together even when we are apart.
Taking to the air allows me to think and clear my head. It is a freeing experience I doubt you've had the honor of feeling just yet.
There is one thing that clears my head just as well though - this song, a true waltz in symphonic form. When the day comes where we dance in unison, this shall be our song. So learn it well, I would quite enjoy our dance to be perfect.
- Vaan
While I was looking over my next month of meetings and appointments, I found myself swaying to the music. This really is my favorite piece, I wish I knew who wrote it. Anywho, I asked around at the record store and they had a second-hand copy, too bad it was missing its sleeve as well. A shame, but now you can have one. Enjoy this song and sway along, like the trees in the wind, and lose yourself for a moment in the music!
- Dr. Wornhardt
Hey <s>Sewer Rat</s> XX,
I've yet to meet someone from the Human town that actually has some value to me, and that's still true. I will not allow you to bring your human nonsense into my town and mess up the place. So take whatever you were playing in your apartment and throw it out immediately. This is real music and I expect you to listen to it. Understood?!
- Xyla
To XX,
Since I fly over your farm on my way into Sun Haven, I've seen you do such interesting things. In Nel' Vari I see Iris, the Elven Enchantress, work with her plants.. but it's different from you. You tend your crops so gently, and with such care, instead. Truly, I'm delighted to see you care for nature, so with this letter I've included a gift that should help your work. Farewell.
Greetings my dear XX,
The more I explore, the more I find people who admire my abilities and admire me. Yet, you continue to only watch me with a smile. Knowing you has made me grateful for the time I spend more grounded. And while I cannot take you with me on my Nimbus Cloud, I wish you to have the same sense of being in the clouds as me. I used my own magic to make a bed this soft for you, so please enjoy it, my dear. I worked so hard that I nearly broke a sweat!
While an apple a day certainly does not keep the doctor away, a treat never hurt anyone now and again either. Make sure you are taking care of yourself and don't be afraid to stop by the hospital or my house for a check-up. I like to make sure everyone in Sun Haven is taken care of, especially if you are working hard in the sun. So come by any time!
You have been working so hard lately, I think you could really use a little time to lean back and watch the clouds. Just like our first date together. A lovely thing it was. So enjoy the clouds, the little things in life that we all wish we had more time for.
Hello Sewer Rat,
You've been such a pest, all of Withergate is talking about you sneaking into <i>my</i> city. Listen to me closely, I will PAY you to just stay out. So take the bribe, and stick to your cushy farm in Sun Haven. You got it?
Seems you're finally understanding the importance of all my work. The buildings, the layout, the shops, the carnival. All my work! When you were on your terrace the other night, I couldn't help but think about that. Wow, you weren't admiring me for once. Instead, you were admiring my craftsmanship, my work. In a way, that felt better than actually getting complimented. So take this, then you can admire my work at all times and compliment me about it later.
Oh great, you brought that <color=#39CCFF>seaweed</color> I wanted. Well, thanks. Oh right, here's your gold.[]I'm still not clear on how this works... do I eat it, or put it on my face?

Farmer, you're a lifesaver. I don't know what we would have done without these <color=#39CCFF>onions</color>.[]Did you think I'd forget your pay? Heh, not a chance!
The tavern is short on <color=#39CCFF>onions</color>. Bring 10 <color=#39CCFF>onions</color> to Ronald at the tavern.
HELP NEEDED!

Oh, thank you XX. I really needed this - my head is killing me. Here, take this as a thank you.
Pinto bumped his head and needs some pain relief. Find a <color=#39CCFF>water crystal</color> and bring it to him at the barracks.
Hello, this is my first time using this board. I'm looking for a <color=#39CCFF>water crystal</color>. Nobody at the barracks seems to have any. I hit my head this morning and have had a headache all day. Please return quickly with a <color=#39CCFF>water crystal</color>.
- Pinto
Pinto's Headache
Is this is for that poster I put on the bulletin board? Neat! I'm going to use these to make some cool armor. Then maybe I can impress Allison.[]Oh, payment. Right, uh... sorry, this is all I have.
Pinto needs some crafting materials. Bring 2 <color=#39CCFF>adamant bars</color> to Pinto at the barracks.
Hello, everyone. I am hoping somebody can find 2 <color=#39CCFF>adamant bars</color> for me to use in crafting better armor. Please bring them to Pinto at the barracks, thank you.
Pinto's Posturing
Haha - it is for pranks, actually![]Have these gloves. They don't fit and are too heavy.
Pod is asking for <color=#39CCFF>eggs</color> but it seems like he's up to something. Oh well, bring Pod 5 <color=#39CCFF>eggs</color>.
Help! I need <color=#39CCFF>eggs</color>. It is not for pranks, that isn't what it's for. I need 5 <color=#39CCFF>eggs</color>! 
Pod's Prank
Oh, you brought the <color=#39CCFF>apples</color>! This is exactly what we need, thanks farmer. Maybe Pinto will learn to stand up straight while I'm shooting an <color=#39CCFF>apple</color> off his head!
Bring 5 <color=#39CCFF>apples</color> to Roza at the barracks.
NEEDED: 5 <color=#39CCFF>apples</color> to the barracks for target practice. See Roza for payment.

Thank goodness somebody came through. If I went another sleepless night, I don't know what would happen to me.[]Here farmer, this should cover the record and then some. Thanks a lot!
Raimi is having trouble sleeping. Bring him a <color=#39CCFF>lullaby record </color> from the record store.
Trouble sleeping, need help!
I've heard there's a nice record at the record store that will help me sleep. Can someone bring me a <color=#39CCFF>lullaby record </color>? I haven't slept well in ages, so this would be greatly appreciated!
- Raimi
Raimi's Lullaby
Whew - that will do! This is perfect, farmer. Thanks so much.[]Oh, the <color=#39CCFF>earth fertilizer I</color>? The loser of the race has to use it as a pillow that night. Heheheh...
For some reason, Roza needs a bag of <color=#39CCFF>earth fertilizer I</color> to motivate the soldiers in a relay race. Bring 1 <color=#39CCFF>earth fertilizer I</color> to Roza at the barracks.
NEEDED: 1 BAG OF <color=#39CCFF>EARTH FERTILIZER I</color>
We're running relays at the barracks this week, and I'm making sure the soldiers are motivated. I'm paying 200 gold out-of-pocket for a bag of <color=#39CCFF>earth fertilizer I</color>. The stinkier the better.
- Roza
Roza's Fertilizer
Oh, now that's a nice specimen. Thanks a lot, farmer. Here, for catching such a beauty.
Apparently, Solon loves <color=#39CCFF>eel</color>. Catch an <color=#39CCFF>eel</color> and bring it to Solon. You can catch <color=#39CCFF>eel</color> while fishing.
Listen up! I want someone to bring me some <color=#39CCFF>eel</color>. It's been too long since I've had my favorite dish, so I'm paying generously. The sooner the better.
Solon's Favorite
So the farmer is the first to show up! The armor you brought looks well-made, too. This should stop those straw dummies from falling apart so quickly - it's impossible to train when my dummies last like five minutes.[]I appreciate it, farmer. Here's that gold for you.
Sophie needs armor for training. Bring a <color=#39CCFF>copper chest plate</color> to Sophie near the Dragon Train to the north of town. You can craft a <color=#39CCFF>copper chest plate</color> with copper ore from the mines.
Attention, citizens!
I am in need of extra armor for training. I'm paying 600 gold for a <color=#39CCFF>copper chest</color>. I'm in a rush to keep training, so hurry up!
- Sophie
Sophie's Armor Quest
All right! I've been waiting for this. When Calvin is off-duty tonight, I'm going to make him eat his words.[]Thanks, farmer. Take this ore like I promised.
Sophie has a wager with Calvin and needs 3 <color=#39CCFF>adamant bars</color>. Bring the <color=#39CCFF>adamant bars</color> to Sophie. You can make <color=#39CCFF>adamant bars</color> by using adamant ore with your smelter.
This is a call asking for 3 <color=#39CCFF>adamant bars</color>. With these bars, I intend to prove Calvin wrong by chopping clean through them with my iron sword. I'm willing to trade 6 mithril ore in return.
Sophie's Strength Test
XX, my hero! This table is so cute, it's perfect. I can't wait to put all my decorations on it. Thanks again, XX!
Craft a <color=#39CCFF>wooden table</color> and bring it to Kitty.
Sprucing Season
Is that really 25 <color=#39CCFF>stones</color>? Uh-oh, I should have asked for more... but this is a real good start. Thank you, farmer!
Topi wants to build a bridge from <color=#39CCFF>stones</color>. Bring him 25 <color=#39CCFF>stones</color> from the mines to do it.
Please help!
I need <color=#39CCFF>stones</color> to build a bridge! I'll need a looooot to build a whole bridge. 25 <color=#39CCFF>stones</color> should be enough!
- Topi
Topi's Bridge
All right, <color=#39CCFF>coal</color>! I'm going to draw pretend tattoos all over Pod. Here, you can have this cool rock I found.
Topi is asking for 5 <color=#39CCFF>coal</color> so he and Pod can draw on each other. Against your better judgment, bring Topi 5 <color=#39CCFF>coal</color>.
Hello! This is Topi. I want <color=#39CCFF>coal</color> so Pod and I can draw on each other. Please bring 5 <color=#39CCFF>coal</color>!
Topi's Tattoos
Hey, my <color=#39CCFF>stones</color>! Thanks a bunch, farmer. You're a true neighbor.
Dr. Wornhardt needs help keeping his office tidy. Bring him 5 <color=#39CCFF>stones</color> to help keep the wind from blowing his papers around. You can find <color=#39CCFF>stones</color> in the mines.
If anyone has the time, I could use some help keeping my office in order. I love working with the window open, but the wind always blows my papers to the floor. Can someone just bring me 5 <color=#39CCFF>stones</color> to help weigh them down? That would be awesome!
Wornhardt's Paperweights
Are these the logs I needed? After this, the hospital will never run out of tongue depressors again! In fact, I may have gone a bit overboard asking for so many <color=#39CCFF>logs</color>...[]Oh well - thanks for coming through!
The hospital is short on tongue depressors. Bring Dr. Wornhardt 25 <color=#39CCFF>logs</color> so the hospital never runs out again.
The hospital needs your help!
For anyone who has time to spare, I could really use a hand with supplies. I'm almost completely out of tongue depressors at the hospital. If someone can deliver 25 <color=#39CCFF>logs</color> to me, I would never run out again! Thanks in advance!

Human
Elf
Elves are one of the oldest races in the world and are mystically attuned to the flow of life energy around them. Friends to all plants and animals, they are most at home in forests. However, younger members of this race are now spreading out into the world and creating villages where Elves have never been seen before.
Demon
Cunning and resourceful, Demons are creatures of darkness. They thrive in the shadow of night and are driven by their appetite for strength. For what is life's purpose if not to maintain power? This is the Demons' creed.
Angel
With grace unmatched, Angels are beacons of light in the darkest skies. They act as watchers of the world and chronicle the history of everything they see. While not every Angel holds to the exact same principles, whatever path they choose they will walk with complete devotion.
Amari
The origins of the Amari exist only as unfounded myth. What <i>is</i> known is that the Amari are strongly linked to their primal spirits, making them loyal allies who are in touch with the wilds of the world.
Elemental
The oldest of all races, Elementals exist as ethereal beings with bodies of whipping flame or flowing water. All that is known about them is that they are the result of nature’s chaotic elements mixed with strange and powerful magic. It is thought that the elementals alive today are the same that have existed for all time since they seem to have no natural lifespan.
Naga
The Naga are a secretive race, living underground for generations to keep their culture unspoiled by outside influence. Because they have hid from the surface for so long, they have learned most everything about subterranean living. Survival is the keystone of their culture.

Arts & Expression
	Elven culture is centered around artistic expression in many forms. Foremost is woodcraft - Elves are considered the most careful and skilled woodworkers to exist worldwide. Horticulture - the art of trimming and shaping plants - is also a celebrated form of expression. 
	Elves have also been known to paint symbols of cultural significance on their houses as well. These symbols can be sigils of health and peace as well as low enchantments for protection and luck. The same symbols are carried over into their rich tradition of tattooing, which is a sign of spiritual maturity among Elves.
Cultural Values
<i>Nature & Harmony</i>
	Elven values are based on the teachings of Nel'Vari's guardian dragon, Nivara. Nivara, also called the World Dragon, teaches the power of peace and harmony with nature. Her connection with nature allows her to practice advanced magical abilities.
<i>Protective Secrecy</i>
	Being the peaceful people they are, Elves have historically been trusting of other cultures. This trust, unfortunately, has led to catastrophe within Nel'Vari. In response, the Elves of Nel'Vari have taken a position of secrecy, allowing only select guests to walk within the city's boundaries. The city itself is protected by an illusion that prevents potential foes from ever finding it.
