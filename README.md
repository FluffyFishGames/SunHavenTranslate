# Sun Haven Translate

This tool can change the games assemblies to make Sun Haven support (a single) translation.

The translation within this repository is german but you can change the *.trans files to your liking.

The tool might not work out of the box when the game got an update as the code most likely will change and new texts are introduced to the game.

So please enjoy but with caution.

## Building yourself
To build this yourself you will have to resolve the reference to the games Assembly-CSharp.dll in the TranslatorPlugin project embedded in this repository.

You also need to add the ModManagerGUI project from my GitHub
