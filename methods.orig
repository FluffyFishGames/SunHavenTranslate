It seems like just yesterday I was barging through your door for the first time... Now look at you!
This is such a beautiful wedding, I told myself I wouldn't cry, but...
Congratulations on the marriage. I couldn't imagine standing up in front of everyone and getting married like that.
So this is how they celebrate marriage in the Human town... Consider me unimpressed.
Hey, good job on getting married. Hope you have lots of happy years together, and all that. So is there going to be any food, or...
This is so different from an Elven wedding... Oh - still nice though!
Oh, XX. I'm so happy for you! If you ever need any advice, you know where to go.
Congratulations, congratulations! You make such a cute cute couple, nya!
Emma and Elizabeth weren't too bothersome during the ceremony, were they? They were both so excited, they wouldn't stop fidgeting... Oh, and congratulations!
Watching two of Sun Haven's citizens joined in matrimony is truly heartwarming. Congratulations, XX.
This is the biggest wedding I've ever been seen. It seems like half the town is here!
Don't worry, I was on alert through the whole ceremony.
Human ceremonies are so much more practical than Elven ones. It's funny how our cultures differ, even in celebration.
What a wonderful ceremony! It's good to have nice things like this to focus on. It's not just a special day for you, you know. The whole town is celebrating
This was... pretty boring.
Don't worry about the chairs, I'll gather them all up.
Looks like you landed the big fish!
Days like this remind us what it means to be part of a community.
The best thing about marriage? Permanent workout partner! Hm, when is the last time Giuseppe joined me on a jog...
Tonya ran a marathon the day after our wedding... I slept in.
Farmer! Are you a daddy now??
Hello, farmer! Liam told us to say congratulations...... Congratulations!!
Can we play games now?
Do I have to get married like this someday, too?
Here's to many happy years together!

Is this meant to be a joke? I hope so, since you're already married...
I firmly believe in living life in extravagance, but it's a little different when it comes to marriage, XX. I'll... definitely pass.
Oh - wow! I'm so sorry XX, but I don't think I'm quite ready for that. We should get to know each other better first, right?
Who do I look like to you? I'm a merchant, not a farm wife. I love the ring, but it's going to take more effort on your part before I say yes.

OH - oh my goodness gracious! XX, I will marry you! Kitty will marry XX, nya nya![]Don't worry, Kitty will get the ceremony set up. You just show up to the event square at 4:00 pm tomorrow! I can't wait!
... Really, do you mean this?[]XX, marrying you would make me the happiest man in town! Yes, let's do it! I'll handle the preparations, you just get yourself to the event square by 4:00 pm tomorrow.
It's about time you asked, XX. I was growing impatient, but now you can take your proper place by the side of Withergate's future king.[]That is to say, I accept your proposal! I'll have some lackeys set up a ceremony tomorrow in your Human town. Be there at 4:00 pm, and don't keep me waiting.

The entrance to Nel'Vari lies deep in the <b>Western Forest</b>, guarded by a mysterious puzzle. The key to the puzzle, I do not know.[]However, the Elves consider their culture to be sacred. Learning more about the Elves could provide insight to the puzzle's solution.[]I, too, have some teachings that will better prepare you to face Dynus. However, you will need to grow in strength before training with me.[]Ultimately, it is up to you to decide which path to take, but be warned, facing Dynus in your current state would be quite dangerous.[]XX, I suggest you train with Nivara and myself before confronting the Moon Dragon. But of course, this is your journey.[]Go now. Prepare yourself. You must face Dynus and save Sun Haven from a dark fate!

King Minos
Welcome to my throne room, newcomer. I am Minos, the Demon King of Withergate.[]You're the person my son found crawling through our sewers. Am I correct?
Yes.
No, that was... someone else.
Good, you speak truthfully. Honesty will take you far with me. XX.
I can see through your lies. XX. It's best if you're honest with me.
How did you know my name?
I understand.
How did you know my name?
I understand.
Nothing escapes my knowledge here. You'll learn that, one way or another.[]Now what business does a little thing like you have in my throne room?
I need to speak with Dynus.
Yes, my advisor Xyla mentioned that. You're new here, yet <i>so very eager</i> to see Dynus. Why?
I'm here to stop his spell of darkness.
Sun Haven wants to give itself to Dynus.
Why in the world would you want that?
Because Sun Haven is in danger.
To save the world from darkness.
I understand now - you think of yourself as the hero. And why wouldn't you?[]You didn't witness the days of sunlight when families were driven from town to town, traveling in darkness for their own safety. All because they were monsterfolk.[]Monsterfolk are done being blamed for Human problems. Withergate's community will not be lost just because the Humans in Sun Haven are afraid of the dark.
This has nothing to do with that.
I'm sorry for what happened to the monsterfolk. I just want to talk to Dynus.
Regardless, there's nothing you can do to stop the Moon Dragon from casting his spell. He's too powerful to be stopped.
Regardless, there's nothing you can do to stop the Moon Dragon from casting his spell. He's too powerful to be stopped.
Why in the world would Sun Haven want to give itself up like that?
Because Sun Haven is bankrupt.
Because Dynus is so powerful.
Mm... Interesting. And what does your guardian, the Sun Dragon, think of this plan?
Who cares what he thinks? He's a weakling.
It was Elios's idea.
I've never seen someone turn against Elios like this... Then again, Sun Haven does seem to be hanging by a thread. Maybe you're telling the truth after all.
Another lie. It's disappointing to see that our newest citizen can't be trusted, even by his own king.[] However, you are a legal citizen of Withergate nonetheless.
I will let you see Dynus... but only after I'm convinced that your loyalty lies not just with Withergate, but with me.[]If you want to earn my trust, go to the forest south of my city and collect the glorite crystals there. Bring me 10 crystals and I will allow you into Dynus's chambers.
Won't that hurt the forest?
We've been mining glorite for years already. There's no damage you can do that hasn't already been done.
That's horrible!
Don't you want to save the forest?
Monsterfolk prefer it dark. It makes Withergate feel more like the home it's meant to be.[]Now quit wasting my time. I don't want to see you again unless you've got a bag full of glorite on your back.

Sewer
I cannot recall the last time my services were needed. What do you hope to accomplish in Withergate, traveler?
I need to stop the darkness spreading.
I need to talk to Dynus, the Moon Dragon.
Ah... Your words are heavy with determination.[]So then, have you finally noticed the sluggish menace creeping out of Withergate? It spreads more each day and brings desolation wherever it goes.
What is it, exactly?
Do you know what is causing it?
It is a darkness that will overcome all natural light, and it is the product of powerful, ancient magic. Magic that only a dragon can wield.[]Do you see? If your goal is to stop the darkness, then you must stop the dragon behind it.
How do I do that?
The Moon Dragon has an appreciation for offerings, which can work to your advantage. You might win his favor if you appease him with a great tribute.[]Of course, you could just stop him the old fashioned way.
The old fashioned way?
Those weapons on your belt speak enough for themselves, adventurer. But challenging the Indomitable Dynus to a duel would end poorly if you approached him now. You look tough, but you'll have to do better than that.[]For now, traveler, we approach our destination.
We have arrived. Go forward with strength.

Ew, an outsider coming in through the sewer. How vulgar.[]It's your unlucky day. My name is Cordelia, and I hold a seat on the Demon King Minos's royal council. As it happens, I'm on my way to see the prince right this moment. I'm sure he'll be thrilled to meet you.
What's this? Did you catch something for dinner?
I found this intruder sneaking in through the sewer system.
The sewer, you said? So old Charon is still repaying his debt. Good to know.[]Cordelia, I believe there's a matter at the pet shop that requires your attention. You go ahead. Xyla and I will handle this.
Yes, Prince Darius.
Don't think yourself too clever just because you found your way through the sewers like a rat.
Didn't Cordelia block that entrance off with a fog spell?
The intruder seems to have gotten past it. The problem with confusion spells is that they rely on the subject having brains.
I told King Minos the sewer was a weak spot... You should talk to your daddy, Darius.
It's irrelevant now.[]What are you here for, outsider?
I need to speak with Dynus.
It's none of your business.
You don't seem to understand the situation here. You're in MY custody. If you don't answer my question, you'll spend the next 5 years locked in my dungeon before I decide to ask again.
I need to speak with Dynus.
The Moon Dragon? You think you can break into our city and waltz right up to Dynus, just like that? You've got some nerve for a little rat!
Anyone seeking audience with the Moon Dragon must be granted permission by King Minos.[]Unfortunately for you, he won't waste time with worthless tourists. King Minos only speaks to his citizens.
That's right, outsider. You want to talk to King Minos? You better start looking for a home here![]Actually, I think the apartment building down the road has vacancies.
I wasn't going to tell that to the outsider, Xyla, but since you seem to want a sewer rat for a neighbor... yes, I believe the apartment building does have one room available.
It's not like they can get an apartment there anyway. Mine cost me a whole 500 tickets! And I'm guessing the outsider isn't <i>exactly</i> rich in Withergate tickets.
That's enough Xyla. Let's leave our unwelcome guest. They're no threat to us. Guards, escort them back to the sewer they crawled out of.

Tickets are the currency in Withergate. You gotta work for it, pal. Do jobs, get money. That's how this world works.

Nathaniel and I give most of our waking hours to Sun Haven. Our purpose is to guide this town forward, including its citizens.[]I just want the two of you to know that we're here for you if you need anything. Truly, don't hesitate to seek us out!
A lot of your new neighbors will say the same thing, too. All of us in Sun Haven are very familiar with each other. People stick around here for a reason. You'll find a reason to stay too, I bet.
There's so much for you to do here, I'm getting excited thinking about it all! Nathaniel, when do you think our new neighbors should visit the Sun Dragon?
I'm not sure, but maybe they should at least see their beds first?
Oh, of course you're right! I'm getting ahead of myself. XX, why don't I accompany you to your new home?
